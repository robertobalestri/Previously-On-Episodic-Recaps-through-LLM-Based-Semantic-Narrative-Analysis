## ISSUE 1: Duplicate IDs in Vector Store Operations

### What the warning meant:
```
WARNING - Found 6 duplicate IDs when deleting arc ed5bc0bf-5654-47fb-b429-91a09dd7fb15, using 8 unique IDs
```

### Explanation:
This is **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR** and not an error! Here's what happens:

1. When deleting an arc, the system queries multiple document types:
   - Main arc documents (where `main_arc_id` = arc_id)
   - Progression documents (where `main_arc_id` = arc_id)  
   - Event documents (where `main_arc_id` = arc_id AND `doc_type` = "event")

2. These queries can return overlapping results because:
   - Some progression documents might also match the main arc query
   - Some event documents might overlap with progression documents
   - The same document could be indexed with multiple metadata patterns

3. The code detects this and handles it gracefully by:
   - Removing duplicates from the ID list
   - Only deleting unique IDs to prevent vector store errors
   - Logging the deduplication for transparency

### Fix Applied:
Changed the log level from WARNING to INFO with clearer messaging:
```
INFO - Found 6 overlapping IDs when deleting arc ed5bc0bf-5654-47fb-b429-91a09dd7fb15 (expected due to document metadata overlap), using 8 unique IDs
```

## ISSUE 2: Double S/E Prefix in Episode Logging

### What the issue was:
```
INFO - Linked 7 characters to progression in SS01EE02
INFO - Updated ArcProgression in SS01EE02
```

### Explanation:
The season and episode values already contain prefixes:
- Season: "S01" (not "01")  
- Episode: "E02" (not "02")

But the logging code was adding additional prefixes:
```python
# WRONG: Adds extra S/E prefixes
logger.info(f"Updated ArcProgression in S{progression.season}E{progression.episode}")
# Results in: "Updated ArcProgression in SS01EE02"

# CORRECT: Uses existing prefixes
logger.info(f"Updated ArcProgression in {progression.season}{progression.episode}")  
# Results in: "Updated ArcProgression in S01E02"
```

### Fix Applied:
Removed the extra "S" and "E" prefixes from logging statements in:
- `character_service.py`
- `repositories.py`  
- `arc_progression_service.py`

### Files That Handle Prefixes Correctly:
`narrative_arc_service.py` already handles this correctly by using:
```python
progression_title = f"{arc.series} | {arc.title} | S{progression.season.replace('S', '')}E{progression.episode.replace('E', '')}"
```
This removes existing prefixes before adding new ones, ensuring clean formatting.

## RESULT:
After these fixes, the logs will show:
```
INFO - Found 6 overlapping IDs when deleting arc ed5bc0bf-5654-47fb-b429-91a09dd7fb15 (expected due to document metadata overlap), using 8 unique IDs
INFO - Linked 7 characters to progression in S01E02
INFO - Updated ArcProgression in S01E02
```

The vector store duplicate handling is working correctly, and the episode/season formatting is now consistent.
