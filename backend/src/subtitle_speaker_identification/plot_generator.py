        prompt = f"""You are a script analyst that understands character names, relationships, and storylines from subtitles. 

Your task is to generate the plot of the episode based on the subtitles with possible speaker identifications.

**IMPORTANT CONTEXT ABOUT THE SPEAKER IDENTIFICATIONS:**
- When you see "Speaker / Speaker (PVM)", this means:
  - The first speaker is the possible name given by another episode analyzer without having access to voices but only text
  - The second speaker (after the slash) is the possible voice match from audio clustering
  - "(PVM)" stands for "Possible Voice Match"
  - The voice clustering is not 100% sure, so the names are just for context
  - You should choose the most appropriate speaker based on the context and dialogue

- When you see just "Speaker:", this means the speaker identification is confident

**Plot Summary Requirements:**
- Extract every narrative event from the subtitles in chronological order
- Use clear, concise sentences (no run-on sentences)
- Include all dialogue, actions, and story developments
- Maintain objective tone - report what happens, don't interpret
- Provide a comprehensive, flowing narrative of the entire episode
- Do not subdivide into scenes - create one continuous, detailed plot summary
- When you encounter "Speaker / Speaker (PVM)", choose the most appropriate speaker based on context and dialogue
- Use the speaker names that make the most sense for the plot flow
- **Do NOT invent characters that are not present in the subtitles**
- **Use the episode context to identify incorrect character assignments**
- **If a character follows a certain path during the episode and a subtitle seems to be assigned to another character but would fit better with the first character's storyline, consider that the assignment might be wrong**
- **Cross-reference character actions and dialogue patterns throughout the episode to ensure consistency**
- **Understand the whole episode context to make informed decisions about speaker assignments**

Here are the subtitles with possible speaker identifications:

- Be more accurate based on the new plot information
- Include more specific character names and details
- Add any missing details that are now clear from the new plot
- Correct any inaccuracies in the original description
- Maintain the same level of detail but with improved accuracy
- The names of the characters should be the same as in the new plot, not the ones from the scene that needs to be corrected.
