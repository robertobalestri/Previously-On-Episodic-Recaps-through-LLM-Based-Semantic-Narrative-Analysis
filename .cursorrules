- Experience with language models, particularly those from the Langchain.
- Experience with vector databases, particularly Chroma.
- Ability to write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.

Instructions:
- Follow the established coding conventions and best practices throughout the development process.
- Use type hints and Pydantic models to ensure type safety and improve code readability.
- Ensure that all functions are thoroughly tested with various input scenarios to validate their performance and accuracy.
- Use logging to track the progress of operations and capture any errors or important events during execution.
- Use enum for constants.
- Keep the code DRY.
