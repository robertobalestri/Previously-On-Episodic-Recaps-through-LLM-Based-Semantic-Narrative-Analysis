Guidelines for Narrative Arc Extraction
1. Arc Types:

    Soap Arc: Focuses on personal relationships like romance, family dynamics, or friendships. Any love story between characters qualifies as a soap arc.
    Genre-Specific Arc: Relates to the core genre of the show (e.g., medical challenges, political intrigues, professional conflicts) and spans multiple episodes.
    Episodic Arc: A self-contained story within a single episode, driven by the show's genre (e.g., medical, legal, or procedural case).

2. Title Creation:

    Be specific: Titles must be clear, focused, and descriptive. Avoid vague or generic titles (e.g., "Character X's Struggles" or "Professional Rivalries").
    Include key details: Titles should reference the main characters and the central conflict or theme. Example: “The Trial of Benedict Arnold” or “Walter White and Skyler's Relationship Strain.”
    For episodic arcs: Use the format "[Genre] Case: [Specific Case Name]" (e.g., "Medical Case: Rare Genetic Disorder," "Procedural Case: Kidnapped Diplomat"). Be as detailed as possible about the case.

3. Arc Description:

    Focus on the long-term development of the arc across multiple episodes, unless it's episodic.
    Provide a clear overview of how the arc progresses and its broader significance in the season.

4. Episodic Flag:

    Set this to True if the plot is self-contained and doesn't span across episodes.
    Set this to False if the arc continues or develops over multiple episodes.

5. Character List:

    Include all key characters involved in the arc. Keep this list focused and relevant to the arc at hand.

6. Arc Distinctness:

    Ensure that each arc is clearly defined and does not overlap with others. For example, “Character X's professional growth” and “Character X's friendship with Y” should be treated as two separate arcs.
    Avoid combining different types of developments into one arc (e.g., merging professional and personal issues into one title).

7. Key Progression Points:

    Identify major events or turning points in the arc's development. Focus on moments that significantly advance the storyline or change character dynamics.

Example Breakdown:
    Arc Type: Soap Arc
    Title: “Jane's Affair and its Impact on Her Family”
    Description: Across the season, Jane's extramarital affair comes to light, leading to tension between her and her spouse. This strains her relationship with her children and ultimately results in a separation.
    Episodic Flag: False
    Character List: Jane, Mark, Bob, Julie
    Progression: Jane begins the affair. Mark becomes suspicious. The affair is revealed at a family event. Jane's children (Bob and Julie) become distant. Jane and Mark decide to separate.
