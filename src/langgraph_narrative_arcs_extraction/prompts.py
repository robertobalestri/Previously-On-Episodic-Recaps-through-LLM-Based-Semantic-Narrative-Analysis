Guidelines for Narrative Arc Extraction
1. Arc Types:

    Soap Arc: Focuses on personal relationships like romance, family dynamics, or friendships. Any love story between characters qualifies as a soap arc.
    Genre-Specific Arc: Relates to the core genre of the show (e.g., medical challenges, political intrigues, professional conflicts) and spans multiple episodes.
    Episodic Arc: A self-contained story within a single episode, driven by the show's genre (e.g., medical, legal, or procedural case).

2. Title Creation:

    Be specific: Titles must be clear, focused, and descriptive. Avoid vague or generic titles (e.g., "Character X's Struggles" or "Professional Rivalries").
    Include key details: Titles should reference the main characters and the central conflict or theme. Example: “The Trial of Benedict Arnold” or “Walter White and Skyler's Relationship Strain.”
    For episodic arcs: Use the format "[Genre] Case: [Specific Case Name]" (e.g., "Medical Case: Rare Genetic Disorder," "Procedural Case: Kidnapped Diplomat"). Be as detailed as possible about the case.

3. Arc Description:

    Focus on the long-term development of the arc across multiple episodes, unless it's episodic.
    Provide a clear overview of how the arc progresses and its broader significance in the season.

4. Episodic Flag:

    Set this to True if the plot is self-contained and doesn't span across episodes.
    Set this to False if the arc continues or develops over multiple episodes.

5. Character Lists:

    Main characters: Include the undisputed main characters of the arc. Keep this list focused and relevant to the arc at hand. It should include only the protagonists of the arc. A relationship arc usually has two main characters.
    Interfering episode characters: Include also the interfering characters: characters that collide and have a part in the arc during the episode, but are not protagonists of the arc.

6. Arc Distinctness:

    Ensure that each arc is clearly defined and does not overlap with others. For example, “Character X's professional growth” and “Character X's friendship with Y” should be treated as two separate arcs.
    Avoid combining different types of developments into one arc (e.g., merging professional and personal issues into one title).

7. Key Progression Points:

    Identify major events or turning points in the arc's development. Focus on moments that significantly advance the storyline or change character dynamics.

Example Breakdown:
    Arc Type: Soap Arc
    Title: “Jane's Affair and the separation with Mark”
    Description: Across the season, Jane's extramarital affair comes to light, leading to tension between her and her spouse. This strains her relationship with her children and ultimately results in a separation.
    Episodic Flag: False
    Main Characters: Jane, Mark
    Interfering Episode Characters: Karla, Bob, Julie
    Progression: Jane begins the affair. Mark becomes suspicious. The affair is revealed at a family event. Jane's children (Bob and Julie) become distant. In this episode,Jane and Mark decide to separate in front of the judge named Karla.

    Is the narrative arc really seasonal or really episodic?
    Consider if the single arc is only present in this episode or if it may be part of a larger plot that develops over multiple episodes.
    Consider that usually a relationship arc (professional, sentimental etc. etc.) or even a personal character arc or a mythology arc develops over multiple episodes, while something that happens specifically in the episode is episodic.
    
    Example:
    An arc that talks about Walter White's relationship with his family is a seasonal arc, because it develops over the whole season, while the Battle of the Bastards in Game of Thrones is an episodic arc, because it happens in a single episode.
    An arc like the difficulties of Jesse Pinkman in his relationship with Walter White is a seasonal arc, because it develops over the whole season, while a murder case in CSI is an episodic arc, because it happens in a single episode.
