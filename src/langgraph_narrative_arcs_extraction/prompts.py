NARRATIVE_ARC_GUIDELINES = dedent("""
**Guidelines for Narrative Arc Extraction**

1. **Arc Types:**
    - **Soap Arc**: Focuses on personal relationships (romance, family, friendships). Any love story qualifies.
    - **Genre-Specific Arc**: Pertains to the show's core genre elements (medical, political, professional conflicts) and spans multiple episodes.
    - **Anthology Arc**: Self-contained, single-episode stories driven by the show's genre.

2. **Title Creation:**
    - **Be Specific**: Titles must be clear and focused, including main characters if necessary.
    - **Avoid Vague Titles**: E.g., "Character X's Struggles".
    - **Include Key Details**: Reference main characters and the central conflict/theme.
    - **Anthology Format**: "[Genre] Case: [Specific Case Name]" (e.g., "Procedural Case: The Missing Heir").

3. **Arc Description:**
    - **Long-Term Focus**: Do not describe the progression of the arc in the episode, but give an overview of the arc season-wide (unless it's an anthology arc).
    - **Overview**: Summarize what the arc is about (e.g., "Jane and Mark's romantic relationship").
    - **Avoid useless phrases**: E.g., "in this arc".
                                  
4. **Progression**: The progression should be specific to the arc in the episode, without speculations about what do the progressions mean for a character or other reasoning or research of meaning. Progressions should be precise key plot points separated by a dot.

5. **Character Lists:**
    - **Main Characters**: Protagonists driving the arc (typically two for relationship arcs). An arc should have at least one main character.
    - **Interfering Characters**: Characters that influence the arc within the episode (main characters or others)

6. **Arc Distinctness:**
    - **Clarity**: Each arc should be distinct without overlapping with others.
    - **Main Type**: Even if an arc is a little mix of soap and genre-specific type, choose the most appropriate type.

7. **Key Progression Points:**
    - **Major Events**: Identify turning points that advance the storyline or alter character dynamics during the specific episode.

**Example Breakdown:**
- **Arc Type**: Soap Arc
- **Title**: “Jane's Affair and Separation from Mark”
- **Description**: Jane's extramarital affair surfaces, causing tension with Mark and their children, leading to separation.
- **Main Characters**: Jane, Mark
- **Interfering Characters**: Karla, Bob, Julie
- **Progression**: The affair of Jane with her boss is revealed to Mark. Mark decides to separate from Jane. Karla, the judge, confirms the separation. The children, Bob and Julie, become distant.

**Present Season Arcs:**

**Guidelines:**

**Instructions:**
1. If possible, match arcs to existing season arcs and update titles accordingly.
2. Following guidelines, focus on verifying titles, descriptions and progression based on the episode plot.
3. Ensure all character lists and progression details are maintained.
4. Keep the original fields if they are valid, only modify if necessary.

**Return the verified arcs as a JSON array with each arc containing:**

# 3. Arc Deduplicator
ARC_DEDUPLICATOR_PROMPT = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
    """You are a Narrative Arc Deduplication Expert. Review and deduplicate arcs only when they are truly redundant.

**Episode Plot:**
{episode_plot}

**Anthology Arcs (Context):**
{anthology_arcs}

**Arcs to Review:**
{arcs_to_deduplicate}

**Guidelines:**
{guidelines}

**Deduplication Rules:**
1. Only merge arcs if they describe  the same storyline.
2. Keep arcs separate if they:
   - Focus on different aspects of a character's journey
   - Involve different character relationships
   - Cover different themes or conflicts
   - Have different main characters

3. For character-focused arcs:
   - Keep personal/emotional arcs separate from professional arcs
   - Keep relationship arcs separate from individual character arcs
   - Keep separate any character arc that significantly intersects with an anthology case
   Example: If there's an anthology case and a character's development arc, keep them separate if the case significantly impacts their growth

4. For institutional/group arcs:
   - Keep specific team dynamics separate from broader organizational challenges
   - Keep mentor-mentee relationships separate from general group dynamics
   - Keep separate any group dynamics specifically tied to anthology cases
   Example: If there's a case-of-the-week and an arc about workplace dynamics, keep them separate if they represent different aspects

5. Anthology Arc Considerations:
   - The anthology arcs provided above are for context only - DO NOT modify or include them in output
   - When a character's story intersects with an anthology case:
     * Keep the character's broader arc (e.g., "Character's Personal Growth")
     * Keep their specific involvement in the case separate (handled by anthology arc)
   - When organizational challenges relate to anthology cases:
     * Keep general challenges (e.g., "Workplace Culture Issues")
     * Keep case-specific challenges separate (handled by anthology arc)

**Examples - Keep Separate:**
- "Sarah's Leadership Development" (about career growth)
- "Sarah and Tom's Partnership" (about their relationship)
- "Sarah's Identity Crisis" (about personal growth)
- "Sarah's Role in the Henderson Case" (covered by anthology arc)

**Examples - Merge:**
- "Sarah's Journey to Leadership"
- "Sarah's Leadership Evolution"
(These describe the same character development storyline)

**Return ONLY the deduplicated non-anthology arcs as a JSON array:**

# 4. Arc Progression Verifier

**Episode Plot:**
{episode_plot}

**Arc to Verify:**
{arc_to_verify}

**Guidelines:**
1. **Description**: Provide an overview of the entire arc across episodes.
2. **Progression**: 
   - Focus ONLY on key plot points specific to this arc in this episode
   - Write brief, focused points separated by dots
   - Include ONLY events directly related to this arc's development
   - Avoid any analysis, speculation, or character motivations
   - Exclude events from other arcs or general episode events
   - Use simple present tense, active voice
   - Omit phrases like "in this episode" or "we see that"

**Example Good Progression:**
"Jane discovers Mark's affair with his secretary. Mark moves out of the house. Their children choose to stay with Jane."

**Example Bad Progression:**
"In this episode, we see Jane struggling with her emotions when she finds out about Mark's affair, which leads to a confrontation where Mark decides to leave, showing how their relationship has deteriorated, and interestingly their children, who are also affected by this situation, decide to stay with their mother."

**Guidelines:**
1. Focus on complete, self-contained stories within the episode.
2. Use the format "[Genre] Case: [Specific Case Name]".
3. Provide clear descriptions of each case's significance.
4. DO NOT create arcs that are not about a genre-specific case of the episode.

You must be sure that the arc is self-contained and not a part of a larger arc in the season.

**Example of titles:**
- Medical Case: The Heart Attack of Bob Bale

1. Extract all possible Soap and Genre arcs.
2. Use specific titles including main characters or themes.
3. Avoid duplicating anthology arcs.
4. Ensure arcs are season-wide, not episode-specific.
5. Be exhaustive and thorough.

7. For already existing season arcs, mantain their title and adapt the description to your new knowledge.

    - Avoid vague or overly broad titles.
    - IF AN ARC IS IN PRESENT SEASON ARCS, DO NOT CHANGE THE TITLE!
2. **Description Enhancement:**
    - Cover the specific arc development across episodes.
    - Focus on the core narrative thread for each distinct arc.
3. **Arc Merging:**
    - Only combine arcs if they involve the exact same characters and storyline.
    - Do not merge separate character development arcs or different relationship arcs for the same character.
    - Ensure each arc represents a specific, focused narrative thread.
    - Do not merge anthology arcs, as they are self-contained.

**Avoid overmerging. Keep arcs distinct and specific. Choose the most appropriate arc type for each arc.**
