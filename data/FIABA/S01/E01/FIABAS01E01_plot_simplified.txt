Near a large forest, a poor woodcutter lived with his wife and two children.
The boy was named Hansel, and the girl was named Gretel.
They had very little food.
When a severe famine struck, the woodcutter couldn't even provide daily bread.
One evening, while in bed, he worried about their situation.
He asked his wife how they could feed the children when they had nothing.
His wife suggested taking the children into the deepest part of the woods the next morning.
She planned to make a fire for them, give them a small piece of bread each, and leave them there.
She believed they wouldn't find their way back, solving their problem.
The man disagreed with her plan.
He refused to leave his children alone in the woods, fearing wild animals would harm them.
She insisted that if he didn't, they would all starve, and pressured him until he agreed.
He felt sorry for the children.
The children couldn't sleep due to hunger and overheard the conversation.
Gretel cried and told Hansel it was the end for them.
Hansel reassured Gretel and told her not to worry.
He knew what to do.
Once the adults were asleep, he got up, put on his jacket, and quietly went outside.
The moon was bright, and the white pebbles looked like silver coins.
Hansel filled his jacket pockets with as many pebbles as he could.
He returned to the house and reassured Gretel, telling her to sleep well and that they would not be abandoned.
Then he went back to bed.
At dawn, before the sun rose, the woman woke the two children, calling them lazy.
They were going into the woods to gather wood.
The woman gave each child a small piece of bread, telling them it was for midday and not to eat it early since there wouldn't be more.
Gretel hid her bread under her apron because Hansel's pockets were full of stones.
They all started walking into the woods together.
After a short distance, Hansel kept stopping and looking back at the house.
The father asked Hansel why he was stopping and reminded him to keep moving.
Hansel replied that he was looking at his white cat on the roof, which seemed to want to say goodbye.
The woman told him he was mistaken and that it wasn't his cat.
The morning sun was shining on the chimney.
Hansel wasn't looking at his cat.
Instead, he was dropping shiny pebbles from his pocket onto the path.
When they reached the middle of the woods, the father told the children to gather wood so he could make a fire to keep them warm.
Hansel and Gretel collected a large pile of twigs.
The twigs were set on fire, and once the flames were strong, the woman told them to rest by the fire.
She said they would go into the woods to cut wood and return later.
Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire.
At midday, they ate their small pieces of bread.
They heard the sound of an ax and thought their father was nearby, but it wasn't an ax.
He had tied a branch to a dead tree, and the wind was moving it back and forth.
After sitting for a long time, they became tired and fell asleep.
When they woke up, it was dark.
Gretel started crying, worried about how they would leave the woods.
Hansel reassured her to wait for the moon to rise so they could find their way.
Once the full moon appeared, Hansel held Gretel's hand.
They followed the shining pebbles that looked like coins, guiding them.
They walked all night and reached their father's house by morning.
They knocked, and when the woman opened the door and saw them, she accused them of being wicked for staying in the woods so long, thinking they didn't want to return.
The father was very happy to see his children again because he didn't want to leave them alone.
Soon after, there was a severe shortage of food everywhere.
One evening, the children heard their mother tell their father that they had eaten almost everything.
They only had half a loaf of bread left.
She insisted they must abandon the children deeper in the woods so they couldn't return.
The father felt very sad and thought it would be better to share the last bit of food with the children.
However, the mother refused to listen and criticized him.
She argued that since he agreed the first time, he must agree again.
The children were still awake and overheard this conversation.
When the adults were asleep, Hansel tried to gather pebbles again.
However, the woman had locked the door, so he couldn't go outside.
He reassured Gretel, telling her not to cry and to sleep well, as God would help them.
Early the next morning, the woman woke the children and got them out of bed.
They received even smaller pieces of bread than before.
On the way to the woods, Hansel crumbled his bread in his pocket.
He often stopped to drop crumbs on the ground.
His father noticed and asked why he kept stopping and looking around, telling him to keep walking straight.
Hansel thought he saw his pigeon on the roof, wanting to say goodbye.
The woman told him it was just the morning sun on the chimney.
Hansel slowly dropped crumbs along the path.
The woman led them deeper into the woods than ever before.
They made a large fire, and the mother told the children to sit and rest if needed.
She said they were going to cut wood and would return in the evening.
At midday, Gretel shared her bread with Hansel.
Hansel had scattered his bread along the path.
They fell asleep, and evening passed without anyone coming for them.
It was dark when they woke up.
Hansel tried to comfort Gretel, saying they could follow the bread crumbs home when the moon rose.
When the moon appeared, they got up but couldn't find any crumbs.
Birds had eaten them.
Hansel reassured Gretel they would find their way, but they couldn't.
They walked all night and the next day until evening without finding a way out of the woods.
They were very hungry, having only eaten a few berries.
Exhausted, they lay under a tree and slept.
By the third morning since leaving home, they started walking again but only went deeper into the woods.
If help didn't arrive soon, they would die.
At midday, they noticed a small white bird on a branch.
It sang beautifully, so they paused to listen.
After singing, it flew ahead of them.
They followed it to a small house.
The bird perched on the roof, and as they got closer, they saw the house was made of bread, with a cake roof and sugar windows.
Hansel suggested they eat, planning to try the roof while Gretel tasted the window.
Hansel broke a piece of the roof to taste it, and Gretel nibbled on the windowpanes.
A gentle voice from inside asked who was nibbling at the house.
The children replied that it was the wind.
They kept eating without stopping.
Hansel enjoyed the roof and took another big piece.
Gretel removed an entire round windowpane.
Suddenly, the door opened, and an old woman with a crutch appeared.
Hansel and Gretel were so scared they dropped what they were holding.
The old woman shook her head and asked who brought them there.
She invited them inside, assuring them no harm would come.
She took their hands and led them into her house.
She gave them a meal of milk, pancakes with sugar, apples, and nuts.
Then she prepared two nice beds with white sheets.
Hansel and Gretel went to sleep, feeling very happy.
However, the old woman was not truly kind.
She was a wicked witch waiting for children.
Her house made of bread was a trap to attract them.
If she caught a child, she would kill, cook, and eat them, which she enjoyed.
Witches have red eyes and poor vision but can smell like animals to detect humans.
When Hansel and Gretel arrived, she laughed cruelly, thinking they wouldn't escape.
The next morning, before they woke up, she got up and looked at them sleeping peacefully with rosy cheeks.
The witch thought Hansel and Gretel would be a good meal.
She grabbed Hansel with her old hand and locked him in a small cage.
Hansel cried, but it didn't help.
She then shook Gretel and told her to get up and fetch water.
Gretel was ordered to cook something good for Hansel, who was locked outside.
The witch planned to fatten Hansel up to eat him.
Gretel cried, but she had to obey.
Hansel was given the best food every day, while Gretel only got crayfish shells.
Every morning, the old woman went to the stall.
She asked Hansel to stick out his finger to check if he was fat.
Hansel tricked her by sticking out a little bone.
The old woman, who had poor eyesight, thought it was his finger.
She was puzzled why he wasn't getting fat.
After four weeks, Hansel was still thin.
The old woman became impatient and decided not to wait any longer.
She called Gretel and told her to fetch water.
She planned to slaughter Hansel the next day, whether he was fat or thin.
Gretel cried as she carried the water.
Tears ran down her cheeks.
She prayed for help, wishing they had died together in the woods.
The old woman told her to stop crying.
The next morning, Gretel woke up early.
She had to hang up the kettle with water and make a fire.
The old woman told her they would bake first.
She mentioned she had already made a fire in the oven and prepared the dough.
The old woman pushed Gretel outside to the oven, where flames were leaping.
The witch told Gretel to climb in and check if it was hot enough for the bread.
She planned to close the oven and bake Gretel to eat her.
Gretel realized the witch's plan and said she didn't know how to get inside.
The old woman called her a stupid goose.
The opening was big enough for the old woman to crawl in.
She stuck her head into the oven.
Gretel pushed her, making her fall inside.
Gretel then closed the iron door and secured it with a bar.
The old woman screamed loudly.
Gretel ran away, and the witch burned up.
Gretel went to Hansel, unlocked his stall, and told him they were saved because the witch was dead.
Hansel jumped out, like a bird from a cage when its door is opened.
They were very happy.
They hugged each other, jumped with joy, and kissed.
Feeling safe, they entered the witch's house.
They found chests of pearls and precious stones everywhere.
Hansel thought these were better than pebbles and filled his pockets.
Gretel decided to take some too and filled her apron.
Hansel then said they must leave the witch's woods.
After walking for a few hours, they reached a large body of water.
Hansel noted they couldn't cross because there was no walkway or bridge.
Gretel noticed there were no boats but saw a white duck swimming.
She thought the duck could help them cross.
She called to the duck, asking for help.
The duck came over, and Hansel climbed onto its back.
He asked Gretel to join him, but she said it would be too heavy for the duck.
She suggested the duck take them one at a time.
The duck agreed and took them across safely.
Once on the other side, they walked until the woods looked familiar.
They eventually saw their father's house in the distance.
They ran to the house, went inside, and hugged their father.
The man had been unhappy since he left the children in the woods.
The woman had passed away.
Gretel emptied her apron, spreading pearls and precious stones on the floor.
Hansel added more by tossing handfuls from his pockets.
Their worries were over, and they lived happily together.
The story ends here.
