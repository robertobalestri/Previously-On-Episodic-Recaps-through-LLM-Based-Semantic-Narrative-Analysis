Near a large forest, a poor woodcutter lived with his wife and two children.
The boy was named Hansel, and the girl was named Gretel.
They had very little to eat.
When a severe famine struck the land, the woodcutter couldn't even provide daily bread.
One evening, while in bed, he worried about their situation.
He asked his wife how they could feed their children when they had nothing for themselves.
His wife suggested taking the children into the thickest part of the woods the next morning.
She planned to make a fire, give them a small piece of bread each, and leave them there while they went to work.
She believed the children wouldn't find their way back home, solving their problem.
The man disagreed with her plan.
He refused to leave his children alone in the woods, fearing wild animals would harm them.
She insisted that if they didn't, all four would starve, and pressured him until he agreed.
He felt sorry for the children.
The children, unable to sleep due to hunger, overheard the conversation.
Gretel cried and told Hansel they were doomed.
Hansel reassured her not to worry.
He knew what to do.
Once the adults were asleep, he got up, put on his jacket, and quietly went outside.
The moon was bright, and the white pebbles looked like silver coins.
Hansel filled his jacket pockets with as many pebbles as he could.
He returned to the house and reassured Gretel, telling her to sleep well and that they would not be abandoned.
Then he went back to bed.
At daybreak, before sunrise, the woman woke the two children, calling them lazy.
They were going into the woods to gather wood.
The mother gave each child a small piece of bread, telling them it was for midday and not to eat it early since there wouldn't be more.
Gretel hid her bread under her apron because Hansel's pockets were full of stones.
They all started walking into the woods together.
After a short distance, Hansel kept stopping and looking back at the house.
The father asked Hansel why he was stopping and reminded him to keep moving.
Hansel replied that he was looking at his white cat on the roof, which seemed to want to say goodbye.
The woman told him he was foolish, saying it wasn't his cat.
Hansel was dropping shiny pebbles onto the path instead of looking at his cat.
When they reached the middle of the woods, their father asked them to gather wood so he could make a fire.
Hansel and Gretel collected a large pile of twigs.
The twigs were set on fire, and the flames grew strong.
The woman told them to rest by the fire while she and the father went to cut wood.
She promised they would return later.
Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire and ate their small pieces of bread at midday.
They heard the sound of an ax and thought their father was nearby, but it wasn't an ax.
He had tied a branch to a dead tree, and the wind moved it back and forth.
They sat for a long time until their eyes closed, and they fell asleep.
When they woke up, it was dark.
Gretel cried, worried about finding their way out of the woods.
Hansel reassured her to wait for the moon to rise.
Once the full moon appeared, Hansel took Gretel's hand.
They followed the pebbles that shone like coins, guiding them.
They walked all night and reached their father's house at dawn.
They knocked, and when the woman opened the door and saw them, she accused them of being wicked for staying in the woods so long, thinking they didn't want to return.
The father was very happy to see his children again because he didn't want to leave them alone.
Soon after, there was a severe shortage of food everywhere.
One evening, the children heard their mother telling their father that they had eaten almost everything.
She mentioned they only had half a loaf of bread left and insisted they must abandon the children deeper in the woods so they couldn't return.
The father felt very sad and thought it would be better to share the remaining food with the children.
However, the mother refused to listen and criticized him.
She insisted that since he agreed the first time, he must agree again.
The children were still awake and heard everything.
When the adults were asleep, Hansel tried to gather pebbles again.
However, the woman had locked the door, so he couldn't go outside.
He reassured Gretel, telling her not to cry and to sleep well, believing that help would come.
Early the next morning, the woman woke the children and took them from their beds.
They received smaller pieces of bread than before.
As they walked to the woods, Hansel crumbled his bread in his pocket.
He often stopped to drop crumbs on the ground.
His father noticed and asked why he kept stopping and looking around, telling him to keep walking straight.
Hansel thought he saw his pigeon on the roof, wanting to say goodbye.
The woman told him it was just the morning sun on the chimney.
Hansel slowly dropped crumbs along the path.
The woman led them deeper into the woods than ever before.
They made a large fire.
The mother told the children to sit and rest if tired.
She said they were going to cut wood and would return in the evening.
At midday, Gretel shared her bread with Hansel.
Hansel had scattered his bread along the path.
They fell asleep, and evening passed without anyone coming for them.
When they woke up at night, Hansel comforted Gretel.
He said they should wait for the moon to find the bread crumbs he had left to guide them home.
When the moon appeared, they got up but couldn't find any crumbs.
Birds had eaten them.
Hansel reassured Gretel they would find their way, but they couldn't.
They walked all night and the next day until evening without finding a way out of the woods.
They were very hungry, having only eaten a few berries.
Exhausted, they lay down under a tree and fell asleep.
It was the third morning since they left their father's house.
They started walking again but only went deeper into the woods.
If help didn't arrive soon, they would die.
Around midday, they noticed a small white bird on a branch.
It sang so beautifully that they paused to listen.
After singing, it spread its wings and flew ahead of them.
They followed it to a small house.
The bird perched on the roof.
As they got closer, they saw the house was made of bread, with a cake roof and sugar windows.
Hansel suggested they eat, saying he would try the roof while Gretel could eat the window.
Hansel broke off a piece of the roof to taste it.
Gretel stood by the windows, nibbling on them.
A gentle voice from inside asked who was nibbling at the house.
The children replied that it was the wind.
They kept eating without stopping.
Hansel enjoyed the roof and took another big piece.
Gretel removed an entire round windowpane.
Suddenly, the door opened.
An old woman, leaning on a crutch, came out.
Hansel and Gretel were so scared they dropped what they were holding.
The old woman shook her head and asked who brought them there.
She invited them inside, assuring them no harm would come.
She took their hands and led them into her house.
She served them a meal of milk, pancakes with sugar, apples, and nuts.
Then she prepared two nice beds with white sheets.
Hansel and Gretel went to sleep, feeling like they were in heaven.
However, the old woman was pretending to be kind.
She was actually a wicked witch waiting for children.
She built her house of bread to attract them.
If she caught a child, she would kill, cook, and eat them, which she considered a celebration.
Witches have red eyes and can't see far, but they can smell like animals and know when people are near.
When Hansel and Gretel approached, she laughed wickedly and thought they wouldn't escape.
Early the next morning, before they woke up, she went to their beds and looked at them sleeping peacefully with their rosy cheeks.
The witch thought Hansel and Gretel would be a good meal.
She grabbed Hansel with her old hand and locked him in a small cage.
Hansel cried, but no one could help him.
She then shook Gretel and told her to get up and fetch water.
Gretel was ordered to cook something good for Hansel, who was locked outside to be fattened up.
The witch planned to eat him once he was fat.
Gretel cried, but she had to obey.
Hansel was given the best food every day, while Gretel only got crayfish shells.
Each morning, the old woman went to the stall.
She asked Hansel to stick out his finger to check if he was fat.
Hansel showed a small bone instead.
The old woman, with poor eyesight, thought it was his finger.
She wondered why he wasn't getting fat.
After four weeks, Hansel was still thin.
The old woman became impatient and decided not to wait any longer.
She called Gretel and told her to fetch water.
She said that whether Hansel was fat or thin, she would slaughter and boil him the next day.
Gretel cried as she carried the water.
Tears ran down her cheeks.
She prayed for help, wishing they had been eaten by wild animals in the woods so they could have died together.
The old woman told her to stop crying.
The next morning, Gretel woke up early.
She hung up the kettle with water and started a fire.
The old woman told her they would bake first.
She mentioned she had already made a fire in the oven and prepared the dough.
The old woman pushed Gretel outside to the oven, where flames were leaping.
She instructed Gretel to climb in and check if it was hot enough for the bread.
The witch planned to close the oven and bake Gretel to eat her.
Gretel realized this and said she didn't know how to get inside.
The old woman called her a stupid goose.
The opening was big enough for the old woman to crawl in.
She stuck her head into the oven.
Gretel pushed her, making her fall inside.
Gretel closed the iron door and secured it with a bar.
The old woman began to howl loudly.
Gretel ran away, and the witch burned up.
Gretel went to Hansel, unlocked his stall, and told him they were saved because the witch was dead.
Hansel jumped out like a bird from a cage when its door is opened.
They were very happy.
They hugged, jumped with joy, and kissed each other.
Feeling safe, they entered the witch's house.
They found chests of pearls and precious stones in every corner.
Hansel thought these were better than pebbles and filled his pockets.
Gretel decided to take some too and filled her apron.
Hansel said they must leave the witch's woods.
After walking for a few hours, they reached a large body of water.
Hansel noted they couldn't cross because there was no walkway or bridge.
Gretel noticed there were no boats but saw a white duck swimming.
She thought the duck could help them cross.
She called to the duck, asking it to carry them on its back.
The duck came, and Hansel climbed on first.
He asked Gretel to join him.
Gretel said it would be too heavy for the duck and suggested they go one at a time.
The duck agreed and took them across separately.
Once on the other side, they walked until the woods became familiar.
They eventually saw their father's house in the distance.
They ran inside and hugged their father.
The man felt unhappy since leaving the children in the woods.
The woman had passed away.
Gretel emptied her apron, spreading pearls and precious stones in the room.
Hansel added more by tossing handfuls from his pockets.
Their worries were over, and they lived happily together.
The story ends with a mouse running, suggesting whoever catches it can make a big fur cap.
