Near a large forest, a poor woodcutter lived with his wife and two children. The boy was named [hansel], and the girl was named [gretel]. The family had very little food. When a severe famine struck, the woodcutter couldn't even provide daily bread.
One evening, while in bed, the woodcutter worried about their situation. The woodcutter asked his wife how they could feed [hansel] and [gretel] when they had nothing. The wife suggested taking [hansel] and [gretel] into the deepest part of the woods the next morning. She planned to make a fire for [hansel] and [gretel], give them a small piece of bread each, and leave them there. She believed [hansel] and [gretel] wouldn't find their way back, solving their problem.
The woodcutter disagreed with his wife's plan. He refused to leave [hansel] and [gretel] alone in the woods, fearing wild animals would harm them. The wife insisted that if the woodcutter didn't, they would all starve, and pressured him until he agreed. The woodcutter felt sorry for [hansel] and [gretel].
[hansel] and [gretel] couldn't sleep due to hunger and overheard the conversation. [gretel] cried and told [hansel] it was the end for them. [hansel] reassured [gretel] and told her not to worry. [hansel] knew what to do. Once the adults were asleep, [hansel] got up, put on his jacket, and quietly went outside.
The moon was bright, and the white pebbles looked like silver coins. [hansel] filled [hansel]'s jacket pockets with as many pebbles as possible. [hansel] returned to the house and reassured [gretel], telling [gretel] to sleep well and that they would not be abandoned. Then [hansel] went back to bed.
At dawn, before the sun rose, the wife woke [hansel] and [gretel], calling them lazy. They were going into the woods to gather wood. The wife gave each child a small piece of bread, telling them it was for midday and not to eat it early since there wouldn't be more. [gretel] hid [gretel]'s bread under [gretel]'s apron because [hansel]'s pockets were full of stones.
They all started walking into the woods together. After a short distance, [hansel] kept stopping and looking back at the house. The woodcutter asked [hansel] why [hansel] was stopping and reminded [hansel] to keep moving. [hansel] replied that [hansel] was looking at [hansel]'s white cat on the roof, which seemed to want to say goodbye. The wife told [hansel] he was mistaken and that it wasn't [hansel]'s cat. The morning sun was shining on the chimney.
[hansel] wasn't looking at [hansel]'s cat. Instead, [hansel] was dropping shiny pebbles from [hansel]'s pocket onto the path. When they reached the middle of the woods, the woodcutter told [hansel] and [gretel] to gather wood so the woodcutter could make a fire to keep them warm. [hansel] and [gretel] collected a large pile of twigs.
The twigs were set on fire, and once the flames were strong, the wife told [hansel] and [gretel] to rest by the fire.
The wife said they would go into the woods to cut wood and return later.
[hansel] and [gretel] sat by the fire.
At midday, [hansel] and [gretel] ate their small pieces of bread.
[hansel] and [gretel] heard the sound of an ax and thought the woodcutter was nearby, but it wasn't an ax.
The woodcutter had tied a branch to a dead tree, and the wind was moving it back and forth.
After sitting for a long time, [hansel] and [gretel] became tired and fell asleep.
When [hansel] and [gretel] woke up, it was dark.
[gretel] started crying, worried about how they would leave the woods.
[hansel] reassured [gretel] to wait for the moon to rise so they could find their way.
Once the full moon appeared, [hansel] held [gretel]'s hand.
[hansel] and [gretel] followed the shining pebbles that looked like coins, guiding them.
[hansel] and [gretel] walked all night and reached the woodcutter's house by morning.
[hansel] and [gretel] knocked, and when the wife opened the door and saw them, she accused them of being wicked for staying in the woods so long, thinking they didn't want to return.
The woodcutter was very happy to see [hansel] and [gretel] again because he didn't want to leave them alone.
Soon after, there was a severe shortage of food everywhere.
One evening, [hansel] and [gretel] heard the wife tell the woodcutter that they had eaten almost everything.
The wife said they only had half a loaf of bread left.
The wife insisted they must abandon [hansel] and [gretel] deeper in the woods so they couldn't return.
The woodcutter felt very sad and thought it would be better to share the last bit of food with [hansel] and [gretel].
However, the wife refused to listen and criticized the woodcutter.
She argued that since he agreed the first time, he must agree again.
[hansel] and [gretel] were still awake and overheard this conversation.
When the adults were asleep, [hansel] tried to gather pebbles again.
However, the wife had locked the door, so [hansel] couldn't go outside.
[hansel] reassured [gretel], telling her not to cry and to sleep well, as [god] would help them.
Early the next morning, the wife woke [hansel] and [gretel] and got them out of bed.
[hansel] and [gretel] received even smaller pieces of bread than before.
On the way to the woods, [hansel] crumbled his bread in his pocket.
[hansel] often stopped to drop crumbs on the ground.
The woodcutter noticed and asked why [hansel] kept stopping and looking around, telling him to keep walking straight.
[hansel] thought he saw his pigeon on the roof, wanting to say goodbye.
The wife told [hansel] it was just the morning sun on the chimney.
[hansel] slowly dropped crumbs along the path.
The wife led [hansel] and [gretel] deeper into the woods than ever before.
They made a large fire, and the wife told [hansel] and [gretel] to sit and rest if needed.
The wife said [hansel] and [gretel] were going to cut wood and would return in the evening.
At midday, [gretel] shared her bread with [hansel].
[hansel] had scattered his bread along the path.
[hansel] and [gretel] fell asleep, and evening passed without anyone coming for them.
It was dark when [hansel] and [gretel] woke up.
[hansel] tried to comfort [gretel], saying they could follow the bread crumbs home when the moon rose.
When the moon appeared, [hansel] and [gretel] got up but couldn't find any crumbs.
Birds had eaten them.
[hansel] reassured [gretel] they would find their way, but they couldn't.
[hansel] and [gretel] walked all night and the next day until evening without finding a way out of the woods.
[hansel] and [gretel] were very hungry, having only eaten a few berries.
Exhausted, [hansel] and [gretel] lay under a tree and slept.
By the third morning since leaving home, [hansel] and [gretel] started walking again but only went deeper into the woods.
If help didn't arrive soon, [hansel] and [gretel] would die.
At midday, [hansel] and [gretel] noticed a small white bird on a branch.
The bird sang beautifully, so [hansel] and [gretel] paused to listen.
After singing, the bird flew ahead of them.
[hansel] and [gretel] followed it to a small house.
The bird perched on the roof, and as [hansel] and [gretel] got closer, they saw the house was made of bread, with a cake roof and sugar windows.
[hansel] suggested they eat, planning to try the roof while [gretel] tasted the window.
[hansel] broke a piece of the roof to taste it, and [gretel] nibbled on the windowpanes.
A gentle voice from inside asked who was nibbling at the house.
[hansel] and [gretel] replied that it was the wind.
They kept eating without stopping.
[hansel] enjoyed the roof and took another big piece.
[gretel] removed an entire round windowpane.
Suddenly, the door opened, and an old woman with a crutch appeared.
[hansel] and [gretel] were so scared they dropped what they were holding.
The old woman shook her head and asked who brought [hansel] and [gretel] there.
She invited [hansel] and [gretel] inside, assuring them no harm would come.
The old woman took their hands and led them into her house.
She gave [hansel] and [gretel] a meal of milk, pancakes with sugar, apples, and nuts.
Then she prepared two nice beds with white sheets.
[hansel] and [gretel] went to sleep, feeling very happy.
However, the old woman was not truly kind.
She was a wicked witch waiting for children.
Her house made of bread was a trap to attract children. If the witch caught a child, she would kill, cook, and eat them, which she enjoyed. Witches have red eyes and poor vision but can smell like animals to detect humans. When [hansel] and [gretel] arrived, the witch laughed cruelly, thinking [hansel] and [gretel] wouldn't escape.
The next morning, before [hansel] and [gretel] woke up, the witch got up and looked at [hansel] and [gretel] sleeping peacefully with rosy cheeks. The witch thought [hansel] and [gretel] would be a good meal. She grabbed [hansel] with her old hand and locked [hansel] in a small cage. [hansel] cried, but it didn't help.
The witch then shook [gretel] and told [gretel] to get up and fetch water. [gretel] was ordered to cook something good for [hansel], who was locked outside. The witch planned to fatten [hansel] up to eat him. [gretel] cried, but [gretel] had to obey. [hansel] was given the best food every day, while [gretel] only got crayfish shells.
Every morning, the witch went to the stall. She asked [hansel] to stick out his finger to check if [hansel] was fat. [hansel] tricked the witch by sticking out a little bone. The witch, who had poor eyesight, thought it was [hansel]'s finger. She was puzzled why [hansel] wasn't getting fat.
After four weeks, [hansel] was still thin. The witch became impatient and decided not to wait any longer. The witch called [gretel] and told [gretel] to fetch water. The witch planned to slaughter [hansel] the next day, whether [hansel] was fat or thin. [gretel] cried as [gretel] carried the water. Tears ran down [gretel]'s cheeks. [gretel] prayed for help, wishing [hansel] and [gretel] had died together in the woods. The witch told [gretel] to stop crying. The next morning, [gretel] woke up early. [gretel] had to hang up the kettle with water and make a fire. The witch told [gretel] they would bake first. The witch mentioned she had already made a fire in the oven and prepared the dough. The witch pushed [gretel] outside to the oven, where flames were leaping. The witch told [gretel] to climb in and check if it was hot enough for the bread. The witch planned to close the oven and bake [gretel] to eat [gretel]. [gretel] realized the witch's plan and said [gretel] didn't know how to get inside. The witch called [gretel] a stupid goose. The opening was big enough for the witch to crawl in.
The witch stuck her head into the oven.
[gretel] pushed the witch, making the witch fall inside.
[gretel] then closed the iron door and secured it with a bar.
The witch screamed loudly.
[gretel] ran away, and the witch burned up.
[gretel] went to [hansel], unlocked [hansel]'s stall, and told [hansel] they were saved because the witch was dead.
[hansel] jumped out, like a bird from a cage when its door is opened.
[hansel] and [gretel] were very happy.
[hansel] and [gretel] hugged each other, jumped with joy, and kissed.
Feeling safe, [hansel] and [gretel] entered the witch's house.
[hansel] and [gretel] found chests of pearls and precious stones everywhere.
[hansel] thought these were better than pebbles and filled [hansel]'s pockets.
[gretel] decided to take some too and filled [gretel]'s apron.
[hansel] then said they must leave the witch's woods.
After walking for a few hours, [hansel] and [gretel] reached a large body of water.
[hansel] noted they couldn't cross because there was no walkway or bridge.
[gretel] noticed there were no boats but saw a white duck swimming.
[gretel] thought the duck could help them cross.
[gretel] called to the duck, asking for help.
The duck came over, and [hansel] climbed onto the duck's back.
[hansel] asked [gretel] to join him, but [gretel] said it would be too heavy for the duck.
[gretel] suggested the duck take them one at a time.
The duck agreed and took [hansel] and [gretel] across safely.
Once on the other side, [hansel] and [gretel] walked until the woods looked familiar.
They eventually saw their father's house in the distance.
[hansel] and [gretel] ran to the house, went inside, and hugged their father.
The father had been unhappy since he left [hansel] and [gretel] in the woods.
The stepmother had passed away.
[gretel] emptied [gretel]'s apron, spreading pearls and precious stones on the floor.
[hansel] added more by tossing handfuls from [hansel]'s pockets.
Their worries were over, and they lived happily together.
The story ends here.
