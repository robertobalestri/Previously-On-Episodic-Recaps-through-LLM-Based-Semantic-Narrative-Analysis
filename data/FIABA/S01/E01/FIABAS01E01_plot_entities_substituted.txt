Near a large forest, a poor woodcutter lived with his wife and two children. The boy was named [hansel], and the girl was named [gretel]. The family had very little to eat. When a severe famine struck the land, the woodcutter couldn't even provide daily bread.
One evening, while in bed, the woodcutter worried about their situation. The woodcutter asked his wife how they could feed [hansel] and [gretel] when they had nothing for themselves. The wife suggested taking [hansel] and [gretel] into the thickest part of the woods the next morning. She planned to make a fire, give [hansel] and [gretel] a small piece of bread each, and leave them there while she and the woodcutter went to work. She believed [hansel] and [gretel] wouldn't find their way back home, solving their problem.
The woodcutter disagreed with his wife's plan. He refused to leave [hansel] and [gretel] alone in the woods, fearing wild animals would harm them. The wife insisted that if they didn't, all four would starve, and pressured the woodcutter until he agreed. The woodcutter felt sorry for [hansel] and [gretel].
[hansel] and [gretel], unable to sleep due to hunger, overheard the conversation. [gretel] cried and told [hansel] they were doomed. [hansel] reassured [gretel] not to worry. He knew what to do. Once the adults were asleep, [hansel] got up, put on his jacket, and quietly went outside.
The moon was bright, and the white pebbles looked like silver coins. [hansel] filled [hansel]'s jacket pockets with as many pebbles as possible. [hansel] returned to the house and reassured [gretel], telling [gretel] to sleep well and that they would not be abandoned. Then [hansel] went back to bed.
At daybreak, before sunrise, the wife woke [hansel] and [gretel], calling them lazy. The family was going into the woods to gather wood. The wife gave each child a small piece of bread, telling them it was for midday and not to eat it early since there wouldn't be more. [gretel] hid [gretel]'s bread under [gretel]'s apron because [hansel]'s pockets were full of stones. They all started walking into the woods together.
After a short distance, [hansel] kept stopping and looking back at the house. The woodcutter asked [hansel] why [hansel] was stopping and reminded [hansel] to keep moving. [hansel] replied that [hansel] was looking at [hansel]'s white cat on the roof, which seemed to want to say goodbye. The wife told [hansel] he was foolish, saying it wasn't [hansel]'s cat. [hansel] was dropping shiny pebbles onto the path instead of looking at [hansel]'s cat.
When they reached the middle of the woods, the woodcutter asked [hansel] and [gretel] to gather wood so the woodcutter could make a fire. [hansel] and [gretel] collected a large pile of twigs. The twigs were set on fire, and the flames grew strong. The wife told [hansel] and [gretel] to rest by the fire while she and the woodcutter went to cut wood.
The wife promised [hansel] and [gretel] they would return later.
[hansel] and [gretel] sat by the fire and ate their small pieces of bread at midday.
[hansel] and [gretel] heard the sound of an ax and thought the woodcutter was nearby, but it wasn't an ax.
The woodcutter had tied a branch to a dead tree, and the wind moved it back and forth.
[hansel] and [gretel] sat for a long time until their eyes closed, and they fell asleep.
When [hansel] and [gretel] woke up, it was dark.
[gretel] cried, worried about finding their way out of the woods.
[hansel] reassured [gretel] to wait for the moon to rise.
Once the full moon appeared, [hansel] took [gretel]'s hand.
[hansel] and [gretel] followed the pebbles that shone like coins, guiding them.
[hansel] and [gretel] walked all night and reached the woodcutter's house at dawn.
[hansel] and [gretel] knocked, and when the wife opened the door and saw them, she accused them of being wicked for staying in the woods so long, thinking they didn't want to return.
The woodcutter was very happy to see [hansel] and [gretel] again because he didn't want to leave them alone.
Soon after, there was a severe shortage of food everywhere.
One evening, [hansel] and [gretel] heard the wife telling the woodcutter that they had eaten almost everything.
The wife mentioned they only had half a loaf of bread left and insisted they must abandon [hansel] and [gretel] deeper in the woods so they couldn't return.
The woodcutter felt very sad and thought it would be better to share the remaining food with [hansel] and [gretel].
However, the wife refused to listen and criticized the woodcutter.
The wife insisted that since the woodcutter agreed the first time, the woodcutter must agree again.
[hansel] and [gretel] were still awake and heard everything.
When the adults were asleep, [hansel] tried to gather pebbles again.
However, the wife had locked the door, so [hansel] couldn't go outside.
[hansel] reassured [gretel], telling [gretel] not to cry and to sleep well, believing that help would come.
Early the next morning, the wife woke [hansel] and [gretel] and took them from their beds.
[hansel] and [gretel] received smaller pieces of bread than before.
As they walked to the woods, [hansel] crumbled his bread in his pocket.
[hansel] often stopped to drop crumbs on the ground.
The woodcutter noticed and asked why [hansel] kept stopping and looking around, telling [hansel] to keep walking straight.
[hansel] thought he saw his pigeon on the roof, wanting to say goodbye.
The wife told [hansel] it was just the morning sun on the chimney.
[hansel] slowly dropped crumbs along the path.
The wife led [hansel] and [gretel] deeper into the woods than ever before.
The wife and the woodcutter made a large fire.
The wife told [hansel] and [gretel] to sit and rest if tired.
The wife said they were going to cut wood and would return in the evening.
At midday, [gretel] shared her bread with [hansel].
[hansel] had scattered his bread along the path.
[hansel] and [gretel] fell asleep, and evening passed without anyone coming for them.
When [hansel] and [gretel] woke up at night, [hansel] comforted [gretel].
[hansel] said they should wait for the moon to find the bread crumbs he had left to guide them home.
When the moon appeared, [hansel] and [gretel] got up but couldn't find any crumbs.
Birds had eaten them.
[hansel] reassured [gretel] they would find their way, but they couldn't.
[hansel] and [gretel] walked all night and the next day until evening without finding a way out of the woods.
[hansel] and [gretel] were very hungry, having only eaten a few berries.
Exhausted, [hansel] and [gretel] lay down under a tree and fell asleep.
It was the third morning since they left their father's house.
[hansel] and [gretel] started walking again but only went deeper into the woods.
If help didn't arrive soon, [hansel] and [gretel] would die.
Around midday, [hansel] and [gretel] noticed a small white bird on a branch.
The bird sang so beautifully that [hansel] and [gretel] paused to listen.
After singing, the bird spread its wings and flew ahead of them.
[hansel] and [gretel] followed it to a small house.
The bird perched on the roof.
As [hansel] and [gretel] got closer, they saw the house was made of bread, with a cake roof and sugar windows.
[hansel] suggested they eat, saying he would try the roof while [gretel] could eat the window.
[hansel] broke off a piece of the roof to taste it.
[gretel] stood by the windows, nibbling on them.
A gentle voice from inside asked who was nibbling at the house.
[hansel] and [gretel] replied that it was the wind.
They kept eating without stopping.
[hansel] enjoyed the roof and took another big piece.
[gretel] removed an entire round windowpane.
Suddenly, the door opened.
An old woman, leaning on a crutch, came out.
[hansel] and [gretel] were so scared they dropped what they were holding.
The old woman shook her head and asked who brought them there.
The old woman invited them inside, assuring them no harm would come.
The old woman took [hansel] and [gretel]'s hands and led them into her house.
She served them a meal of milk, pancakes with sugar, apples, and nuts.
Then she prepared two nice beds with white sheets.
[hansel] and [gretel] went to sleep, feeling like they were in heaven.
However, the old woman was pretending to be kind. The old woman was actually a wicked witch waiting for children. The witch built her house of bread to attract them. If the witch caught a child, she would kill, cook, and eat the child, which she considered a celebration. Witches have red eyes and can't see far, but they can smell like animals and know when people are near. When [hansel] and [gretel] approached, the witch laughed wickedly and thought [hansel] and [gretel] wouldn't escape.
Early the next morning, before [hansel] and [gretel] woke up, the witch went to their beds and looked at [hansel] and [gretel] sleeping peacefully with their rosy cheeks. The witch thought [hansel] and [gretel] would be a good meal. The witch grabbed [hansel] with her old hand and locked [hansel] in a small cage. [hansel] cried, but no one could help [hansel]. The witch then shook [gretel] and told [gretel] to get up and fetch water. [gretel] was ordered to cook something good for [hansel], who was locked outside to be fattened up. The witch planned to eat [hansel] once he was fat. [gretel] cried, but [gretel] had to obey. [hansel] was given the best food every day, while [gretel] only got crayfish shells. Each morning, the old woman went to the stall. The witch asked [hansel] to stick out his finger to check if he was fat. [hansel] showed a small bone instead.
The witch, with poor eyesight, thought it was [hansel]'s finger.
The witch wondered why [hansel] wasn't getting fat.
After four weeks, [hansel] was still thin.
The witch became impatient and decided not to wait any longer.
The witch called [gretel] and told [gretel] to fetch water.
The witch said that whether [hansel] was fat or thin, she would slaughter and boil [hansel] the next day.
[gretel] cried as [gretel] carried the water.
Tears ran down [gretel]'s cheeks.
[gretel] prayed for help, wishing [hansel] and [gretel] had been eaten by wild animals in the woods so they could have died together.
The witch told [gretel] to stop crying.
The next morning, [gretel] woke up early.
[gretel] hung up the kettle with water and started a fire.
The witch told [gretel] they would bake first.
The witch mentioned she had already made a fire in the oven and prepared the dough.
The witch pushed [gretel] outside to the oven, where flames were leaping.
The witch instructed [gretel] to climb in and check if it was hot enough for the bread.
The witch planned to close the oven and bake [gretel] to eat her.
[gretel] realized this and said [gretel] didn't know how to get inside.
The witch called [gretel] a stupid goose.
The opening was big enough for the witch to crawl in.
The witch stuck her head into the oven.
[gretel] pushed the witch, making her fall inside.
[gretel] closed the iron door and secured it with a bar.
The witch began to howl loudly.
[gretel] ran away, and the witch burned up.
[gretel] went to [hansel], unlocked his stall, and told [hansel] they were saved because the witch was dead.
[hansel] jumped out like a bird from a cage when its door is opened.
[hansel] and [gretel] were very happy.
They hugged, jumped with joy, and kissed each other.
Feeling safe, [hansel] and [gretel] entered the witch's house.
They found chests of pearls and precious stones in every corner.
[hansel] thought these were better than pebbles and filled his pockets.
[gretel] decided to take some too and filled her apron.
[hansel] said they must leave the witch's woods.
After walking for a few hours, [hansel] and [gretel] reached a large body of water.
[hansel] noted they couldn't cross because there was no walkway or bridge.
[gretel] noticed there were no boats but saw a white duck swimming.
[gretel] thought the duck could help [hansel] and her cross.
[gretel] called to the duck, asking it to carry them on its back.
The duck came, and [hansel] climbed on first.
[hansel] asked [gretel] to join him.
[gretel] said it would be too heavy for the duck and suggested they go one at a time.
The duck agreed and took them across separately.
Once on the other side, [hansel] and [gretel] walked until the woods became familiar.
They eventually saw their father's house in the distance.
[hansel] and [gretel] ran inside and hugged their father.
The father felt unhappy since leaving [hansel] and [gretel] in the woods.
The stepmother had passed away.
[gretel] emptied her apron, spreading pearls and precious stones in the room.
[hansel] added more by tossing handfuls from his pockets.
Their worries were over, and they lived happily together.
The story ends with a mouse running, suggesting whoever catches it can make a big fur cap.
