In a time of famine, a poor woodcutter and his wife decide to abandon their children, Hansel and Gretel, in the woods to prevent starvation. The woodcutter initially disagrees but eventually agrees to the plan. Hansel overhears their conversation and collects pebbles to mark their way back home. After being left in the woods, Hansel and Gretel follow the pebbles back home, much to their father's relief. However, the stepmother insists they must abandon the children again due to dwindling food supplies. This time, Hansel drops breadcrumbs, but birds eat them, leaving the children lost in the woods.

After wandering for days, they discover a house made of candy, owned by a wicked witch who captures Hansel and plans to eat him. The witch locks Hansel in a cage and forces Gretel to cook for him. Gretel eventually outsmarts the witch, pushing her into the oven and killing her. The siblings find treasure in the witch's house and escape. They cross a river with the help of a duck and return home, where they reunite with their father, who is remorseful for leaving them. The stepmother has died, and the family is finally happy and prosperous with the treasure they found.
