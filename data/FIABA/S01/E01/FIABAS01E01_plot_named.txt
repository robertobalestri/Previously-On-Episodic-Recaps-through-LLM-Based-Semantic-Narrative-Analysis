Near a large forest, a poor woodcutter lived with his wife and two children. The boy was named Hansel, and the girl was named Gretel. The family had very little food. When a severe famine struck, the woodcutter couldn't even provide daily bread.
One evening, while in bed, the woodcutter worried about their situation. The woodcutter asked his wife how they could feed Hansel and Gretel when they had nothing. The wife suggested taking Hansel and Gretel into the deepest part of the woods the next morning. She planned to make a fire for Hansel and Gretel, give them a small piece of bread each, and leave them there. She believed Hansel and Gretel wouldn't find their way back, solving their problem.
The woodcutter disagreed with his wife's plan. He refused to leave Hansel and Gretel alone in the woods, fearing wild animals would harm them. The wife insisted that if the woodcutter didn't, they would all starve, and pressured him until he agreed. The woodcutter felt sorry for Hansel and Gretel.
Hansel and Gretel couldn't sleep due to hunger and overheard the conversation. Gretel cried and told Hansel it was the end for them. Hansel reassured Gretel and told her not to worry. Hansel knew what to do. Once the adults were asleep, Hansel got up, put on his jacket, and quietly went outside.
The moon was bright, and the white pebbles looked like silver coins. Hansel filled Hansel's jacket pockets with as many pebbles as possible. Hansel returned to the house and reassured Gretel, telling Gretel to sleep well and that they would not be abandoned. Then Hansel went back to bed.
At dawn, before the sun rose, the wife woke Hansel and Gretel, calling them lazy. They were going into the woods to gather wood. The wife gave each child a small piece of bread, telling them it was for midday and not to eat it early since there wouldn't be more. Gretel hid Gretel's bread under Gretel's apron because Hansel's pockets were full of stones.
They all started walking into the woods together. After a short distance, Hansel kept stopping and looking back at the house. The woodcutter asked Hansel why Hansel was stopping and reminded Hansel to keep moving. Hansel replied that Hansel was looking at Hansel's white cat on the roof, which seemed to want to say goodbye. The wife told Hansel he was mistaken and that it wasn't Hansel's cat. The morning sun was shining on the chimney.
Hansel wasn't looking at Hansel's cat. Instead, Hansel was dropping shiny pebbles from Hansel's pocket onto the path. When they reached the middle of the woods, the woodcutter told Hansel and Gretel to gather wood so the woodcutter could make a fire to keep them warm. Hansel and Gretel collected a large pile of twigs.
The twigs were set on fire, and once the flames were strong, the wife told Hansel and Gretel to rest by the fire.
The wife said they would go into the woods to cut wood and return later.
Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire.
At midday, Hansel and Gretel ate their small pieces of bread.
Hansel and Gretel heard the sound of an ax and thought the woodcutter was nearby, but it wasn't an ax.
The woodcutter had tied a branch to a dead tree, and the wind was moving it back and forth.
After sitting for a long time, Hansel and Gretel became tired and fell asleep.
When Hansel and Gretel woke up, it was dark.
Gretel started crying, worried about how they would leave the woods.
Hansel reassured Gretel to wait for the moon to rise so they could find their way.
Once the full moon appeared, Hansel held Gretel's hand.
Hansel and Gretel followed the shining pebbles that looked like coins, guiding them.
Hansel and Gretel walked all night and reached the woodcutter's house by morning.
Hansel and Gretel knocked, and when the wife opened the door and saw them, she accused them of being wicked for staying in the woods so long, thinking they didn't want to return.
The woodcutter was very happy to see Hansel and Gretel again because he didn't want to leave them alone.
Soon after, there was a severe shortage of food everywhere.
One evening, Hansel and Gretel heard the wife tell the woodcutter that they had eaten almost everything.
The wife said they only had half a loaf of bread left.
The wife insisted they must abandon Hansel and Gretel deeper in the woods so they couldn't return.
The woodcutter felt very sad and thought it would be better to share the last bit of food with Hansel and Gretel.
However, the wife refused to listen and criticized the woodcutter.
She argued that since he agreed the first time, he must agree again.
Hansel and Gretel were still awake and overheard this conversation.
When the adults were asleep, Hansel tried to gather pebbles again.
However, the wife had locked the door, so Hansel couldn't go outside.
Hansel reassured Gretel, telling her not to cry and to sleep well, as God would help them.
Early the next morning, the wife woke Hansel and Gretel and got them out of bed.
Hansel and Gretel received even smaller pieces of bread than before.
On the way to the woods, Hansel crumbled his bread in his pocket.
Hansel often stopped to drop crumbs on the ground.
The woodcutter noticed and asked why Hansel kept stopping and looking around, telling him to keep walking straight.
Hansel thought he saw his pigeon on the roof, wanting to say goodbye.
The wife told Hansel it was just the morning sun on the chimney.
Hansel slowly dropped crumbs along the path.
The wife led Hansel and Gretel deeper into the woods than ever before.
They made a large fire, and the wife told Hansel and Gretel to sit and rest if needed.
The wife said Hansel and Gretel were going to cut wood and would return in the evening.
At midday, Gretel shared her bread with Hansel.
Hansel had scattered his bread along the path.
Hansel and Gretel fell asleep, and evening passed without anyone coming for them.
It was dark when Hansel and Gretel woke up.
Hansel tried to comfort Gretel, saying they could follow the bread crumbs home when the moon rose.
When the moon appeared, Hansel and Gretel got up but couldn't find any crumbs.
Birds had eaten them.
Hansel reassured Gretel they would find their way, but they couldn't.
Hansel and Gretel walked all night and the next day until evening without finding a way out of the woods.
Hansel and Gretel were very hungry, having only eaten a few berries.
Exhausted, Hansel and Gretel lay under a tree and slept.
By the third morning since leaving home, Hansel and Gretel started walking again but only went deeper into the woods.
If help didn't arrive soon, Hansel and Gretel would die.
At midday, Hansel and Gretel noticed a small white bird on a branch.
The bird sang beautifully, so Hansel and Gretel paused to listen.
After singing, the bird flew ahead of them.
Hansel and Gretel followed it to a small house.
The bird perched on the roof, and as Hansel and Gretel got closer, they saw the house was made of bread, with a cake roof and sugar windows.
Hansel suggested they eat, planning to try the roof while Gretel tasted the window.
Hansel broke a piece of the roof to taste it, and Gretel nibbled on the windowpanes.
A gentle voice from inside asked who was nibbling at the house.
Hansel and Gretel replied that it was the wind.
They kept eating without stopping.
Hansel enjoyed the roof and took another big piece.
Gretel removed an entire round windowpane.
Suddenly, the door opened, and an old woman with a crutch appeared.
Hansel and Gretel were so scared they dropped what they were holding.
The old woman shook her head and asked who brought Hansel and Gretel there.
She invited Hansel and Gretel inside, assuring them no harm would come.
The old woman took their hands and led them into her house.
She gave Hansel and Gretel a meal of milk, pancakes with sugar, apples, and nuts.
Then she prepared two nice beds with white sheets.
Hansel and Gretel went to sleep, feeling very happy.
However, the old woman was not truly kind.
She was a wicked witch waiting for children.
Her house made of bread was a trap to attract children. If the witch caught a child, she would kill, cook, and eat them, which she enjoyed. Witches have red eyes and poor vision but can smell like animals to detect humans. When Hansel and Gretel arrived, the witch laughed cruelly, thinking Hansel and Gretel wouldn't escape.
The next morning, before Hansel and Gretel woke up, the witch got up and looked at Hansel and Gretel sleeping peacefully with rosy cheeks. The witch thought Hansel and Gretel would be a good meal. She grabbed Hansel with her old hand and locked Hansel in a small cage. Hansel cried, but it didn't help.
The witch then shook Gretel and told Gretel to get up and fetch water. Gretel was ordered to cook something good for Hansel, who was locked outside. The witch planned to fatten Hansel up to eat him. Gretel cried, but Gretel had to obey. Hansel was given the best food every day, while Gretel only got crayfish shells.
Every morning, the witch went to the stall. She asked Hansel to stick out his finger to check if Hansel was fat. Hansel tricked the witch by sticking out a little bone. The witch, who had poor eyesight, thought it was Hansel's finger. She was puzzled why Hansel wasn't getting fat.
After four weeks, Hansel was still thin. The witch became impatient and decided not to wait any longer. The witch called Gretel and told Gretel to fetch water. The witch planned to slaughter Hansel the next day, whether Hansel was fat or thin. Gretel cried as Gretel carried the water. Tears ran down Gretel's cheeks. Gretel prayed for help, wishing Hansel and Gretel had died together in the woods. The witch told Gretel to stop crying. The next morning, Gretel woke up early. Gretel had to hang up the kettle with water and make a fire. The witch told Gretel they would bake first. The witch mentioned she had already made a fire in the oven and prepared the dough. The witch pushed Gretel outside to the oven, where flames were leaping. The witch told Gretel to climb in and check if it was hot enough for the bread. The witch planned to close the oven and bake Gretel to eat Gretel. Gretel realized the witch's plan and said Gretel didn't know how to get inside. The witch called Gretel a stupid goose. The opening was big enough for the witch to crawl in.
The witch stuck her head into the oven.
Gretel pushed the witch, making the witch fall inside.
Gretel then closed the iron door and secured it with a bar.
The witch screamed loudly.
Gretel ran away, and the witch burned up.
Gretel went to Hansel, unlocked Hansel's stall, and told Hansel they were saved because the witch was dead.
Hansel jumped out, like a bird from a cage when its door is opened.
Hansel and Gretel were very happy.
Hansel and Gretel hugged each other, jumped with joy, and kissed.
Feeling safe, Hansel and Gretel entered the witch's house.
Hansel and Gretel found chests of pearls and precious stones everywhere.
Hansel thought these were better than pebbles and filled Hansel's pockets.
Gretel decided to take some too and filled Gretel's apron.
Hansel then said they must leave the witch's woods.
After walking for a few hours, Hansel and Gretel reached a large body of water.
Hansel noted they couldn't cross because there was no walkway or bridge.
Gretel noticed there were no boats but saw a white duck swimming.
Gretel thought the duck could help them cross.
Gretel called to the duck, asking for help.
The duck came over, and Hansel climbed onto the duck's back.
Hansel asked Gretel to join him, but Gretel said it would be too heavy for the duck.
Gretel suggested the duck take them one at a time.
The duck agreed and took Hansel and Gretel across safely.
Once on the other side, Hansel and Gretel walked until the woods looked familiar.
They eventually saw their father's house in the distance.
Hansel and Gretel ran to the house, went inside, and hugged their father.
The father had been unhappy since he left Hansel and Gretel in the woods.
The stepmother had passed away.
Gretel emptied Gretel's apron, spreading pearls and precious stones on the floor.
Hansel added more by tossing handfuls from Hansel's pockets.
Their worries were over, and they lived happily together.
The story ends here.
