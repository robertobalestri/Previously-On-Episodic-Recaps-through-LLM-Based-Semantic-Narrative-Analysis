00:00:01,091 --> 00:00:03,457
<i>Previously on Grey's Anatomy:</i>

2
00:00:03,527 --> 00:00:05,859
I slept with George.
It was a horrible mistake.

3
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:08,693
But I have no interest
in obstetrics or gynecology.

4
00:00:08,765 --> 00:00:11,097
Your ass is mine until I say otherwise.

5
00:00:11,168 --> 00:00:13,295
We spent the night at Callie's
last night,

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,304
so we figured
we'd spend the night here.

7
00:00:15,372 --> 00:00:16,703
Oh, hi.

8
00:00:16,773 --> 00:00:18,297
You're falling for a vet.

9
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:22,141
I'm also dating.
You. If you still want to.

10
00:00:22,212 --> 00:00:24,578
He was listless
and hadn't eaten all day.

11
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,309
- Let's have a look.
- Hey.

12
00:00:26,383 --> 00:00:29,250
- Is he sick again?
- Yeah.

13
00:00:33,423 --> 00:00:36,620
<i>We all go through life
like bulls in a china shop.</i>

14
00:00:36,693 --> 00:00:39,253
<i>A chip here, a crack there.</i>

15
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,763
<i>Doing damage to ourselves.</i>

16
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:43,823
<i>To other people.</i>

17
00:00:46,503 --> 00:00:50,098
- So, uh, I don't cook.
- Nobody asked you to cook.

18
00:00:50,174 --> 00:00:54,076
I know, I'm just saying that, you know,
I don't cook, so you don't have to cook.

19
00:00:54,144 --> 00:00:56,203
I don't expect you to cook for me.

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,907
OK. You. Sit there.

21
00:00:58,982 --> 00:01:00,347
Sit down.

22
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:02,385
I want you to drink this

23
00:01:02,452 --> 00:01:06,752
and try really hard to act like
you aren't scary and damaged.

24
00:01:06,823 --> 00:01:09,087
I'm not scary and damaged.

25
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:12,617
- Yeah, you are.
- No. I'm not scary or damaged.

26
00:01:12,696 --> 00:01:17,429
Mm-hmm. All right. Why don't you
tell me about your family?

27
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:19,162
OK.

28
00:01:19,236 --> 00:01:23,263
Me not wanting to talk about my family,
does not make me scary or damaged.

29
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,739
OK.

30
00:01:25,642 --> 00:01:27,803
Tell me about the last guy
you slept with.

31
00:01:27,878 --> 00:01:32,372
<i>The problem is trying to figure out how
to control the damage we have done.</i>

32
00:01:32,449 --> 00:01:35,282
<i>Or that's been done to us.</i>

33
00:01:35,352 --> 00:01:38,879
- What did you say to him?
- Nothing. I fled the scene.

34
00:01:38,956 --> 00:01:41,117
You didn't tell him about George
or Derek?

35
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:44,683
- No.
- Hmm. You like him.

36
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:47,696
- I could like him.
- Is the sex any good?

37
00:01:47,764 --> 00:01:48,822
I don't know.

38
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,232
Four dates and two sleepovers
at his place and no sex?

39
00:01:52,302 --> 00:01:54,463
Not even a kiss good night.

40
00:01:54,538 --> 00:01:56,733
Oh, I am proud.

41
00:01:57,441 --> 00:01:59,705
I am like a proud mama.

42
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:01,767
Shut up.

43
00:02:07,217 --> 00:02:09,208
Morning.

44
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:15,756
<i>Sometimes the damage catches us
by surprise.</i>

45
00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:33,436
Oh, my God. Did that just happen?

46
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,708
I'm having a seizure.
I am clearly mid-seizure. I'm seizing.

47
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:40,875
- Oh, my God.
- She didn't even wash her hands.

48
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:42,111
Oh, my God.

49
00:02:42,185 --> 00:02:44,983
<i>Sometimes we think
we can fix the damage.</i>

50
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:48,183
All I'm saying is if she needs to pee
she could at least wear a bra.

51
00:02:48,258 --> 00:02:49,987
Or maybe wait until she's alone.

52
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,427
For the love of sanitation, could
she wash her hands? She's a surgeon.

53
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:56,694
You said you were blocking the sink.
I think you're exaggerating.

54
00:02:56,767 --> 00:03:00,032
She peed. Naked peeing.
Ask Meredith. Meredith?

55
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:03,271
That's right, I forgot,
you're not talking to her.

56
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,468
- Oh!
- She'd say Callie crosses the line.

57
00:03:06,543 --> 00:03:10,138
So crossed the line.
So freaking crossed.

58
00:03:10,213 --> 00:03:14,047
Oh. We're still pretending that
you're not seeing a patient, right?

59
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,424
People, what's with all the evil misery?
Huh? Live and let live.

60
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,855
- You're cheerful.
- Oh, come on.

61
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:27,055
You are. How's that possible?

62
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,258
I scrubbed in on a four-hour
paraesophageal hernia last night.

63
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:31,528
Then I got laid.

64
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:35,503
And now, three ambulances are coming in
full of bloody broken car crash victims,

65
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:37,972
all who need to be cut open.

66
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,030
So, I'm cheery!

67
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:43,011
<i>And sometimes the damage
is something we can't even see.</i>

68
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,570
I'm cheerful!

69
00:03:44,648 --> 00:03:45,979
Sorry, sir, I...

70
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:47,573
- Hey.
- How's my dog?

71
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:49,642
- Better. Finn's running tests.
- Good.

72
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,585
- Our dog.
- What?

73
00:03:51,655 --> 00:03:54,590
Our dog. You said "my dog. "
He's our dog.

74
00:03:56,293 --> 00:03:59,285
- Yeah, whatever.
- Are you mad at me or something?

75
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:02,332
Now's not the time.

76
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:04,833
25-year-old restrained driver,
Noah Reynolds.

77
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:06,926
Vitals stable. Right knee pain.

78
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:10,461
- Curtain three.
- Noah? You still alive?

79
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,101
I'm still alive, baby!
My wife's side took all of the impact.

80
00:04:14,177 --> 00:04:16,042
Her parents were in the other car.

81
00:04:16,113 --> 00:04:19,241
Some jerk slammed into them
and then they slammed into us.

82
00:04:19,316 --> 00:04:21,682
On three. One. Two. Three.

83
00:04:21,752 --> 00:04:25,210
22-year-old pregnant restrained
passenger T-boned on her side.

84
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:28,587
Prolonged extrication in the field.
BP 90 over 50. Pulse in the 80s.

85
00:04:28,658 --> 00:04:31,889
- Trauma room one.
- Trauma? No. I'm fine. Really.

86
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:34,396
You don't have to go to
all that trouble. I am fine.

87
00:04:34,464 --> 00:04:38,093
The air bags went off. If you could
just check on my baby and my family.

88
00:04:38,168 --> 00:04:41,228
My husband. Noah?
You saw Mama breathing, right?

89
00:04:41,304 --> 00:04:45,172
And Daddy? Where the hell's Daddy?
Mama and Daddy are still alive, right?

90
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:47,972
- They're in the next ambulance.
- They're alive, right?

91
00:04:48,044 --> 00:04:50,569
- Please don't move, ma'am.
- I need to know.

92
00:04:50,647 --> 00:04:52,740
Yeah, I'll ask someone about... Mama.

93
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:54,147
And Daddy.

94
00:04:54,217 --> 00:04:58,779
Driver and front-seat passenger both
early 50s, both restrained, both stable.

95
00:04:58,855 --> 00:05:02,586
The passenger has some leg and arm
pain, the driver has chest pain.

96
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:04,650
Dang it all to heck!

97
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:08,994
Excuse my French, honey, but I need some
whatever kind of horse pills you've got,

98
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:11,431
because this hurts like the dickens!

99
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:15,062
- Uh, that would be Mama?
- Mama! You OK?

100
00:05:15,138 --> 00:05:17,129
I am in pain!

101
00:05:17,207 --> 00:05:21,200
- Get off. Get off!
- Sir, I need to clear your spine.

102
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:24,076
My spine is fine
and you can sew up my head later.

103
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:26,911
- Where's my girl?
- Daddy?

104
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:28,041
- Jim?
- Noah?

105
00:05:28,118 --> 00:05:30,211
- Mel?
- Mama?

106
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:31,914
The hillbilly picnic.

107
00:05:32,823 --> 00:05:36,623
Could everybody shut up for a minute?
I'm trying to find a fetal heartbeat.

108
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:38,786
- Is the baby OK?
- Hold on.

109
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:45,529
The baby's heart rate is 152 and strong.
It's... It's OK.

110
00:05:47,838 --> 00:05:50,329
- They're both good. They're good.
- Thank the Lord.

111
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:52,398
Thank the Lord they're all right.

112
00:05:53,043 --> 00:05:57,707
- Dr. Bailey, another car crash victim.
- That's him! That's the guy who hit us!

113
00:05:57,781 --> 00:06:00,579
- I'll kill him! I'm going to get you!
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

114
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,813
- You son of a bitch!
- Big Jim, just hold your horses!

115
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:06,447
He's hurt. He's already hurt.

116
00:06:06,523 --> 00:06:08,150
- Good!
- Daddy?

117
00:06:08,225 --> 00:06:10,216
Don't ask me to be neighborly!

118
00:06:10,293 --> 00:06:13,558
Trauma three. Page Ortho and Neuro.
O'Malley, give her a hand.

119
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,791
- What happened?
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

120
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:17,595
What are you doing, young man?

121
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:20,261
- I'm just trying to examine you.
- I don't think so.

122
00:06:20,337 --> 00:06:22,271
I don't have any panties on.

123
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:27,174
I do not know you well enough to let you
see my good girl. Get me a lady doctor.

124
00:06:27,244 --> 00:06:29,405
I need a chick over here!

125
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:33,540
- What happened?
- Marshall Stone, intern at Mercy West.

126
00:06:33,617 --> 00:06:34,743
What happened?

127
00:06:34,818 --> 00:06:37,082
Page Ortho to look at his wrist
and contact CT.

128
00:06:37,153 --> 00:06:38,313
Yes, Dr. Shepherd.

129
00:06:38,388 --> 00:06:40,754
I'm going to say three words
to you, OK?

130
00:06:40,824 --> 00:06:44,351
Then I want you to repeat them back
to Dr. Grey. Can you do that?

131
00:06:44,427 --> 00:06:46,861
- OK.
- OK. Bat, orange, car.

132
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,455
- You think you can remember that?
- Mm-hmm.

133
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:51,296
Good. OK.

134
00:06:51,368 --> 00:06:54,531
Here. He has a closed head injury.

135
00:06:54,604 --> 00:06:59,098
Watch for vomiting, confusion
and loss of consciousness, OK?

136
00:06:59,175 --> 00:07:01,075
- All right.
- Good.

137
00:07:01,144 --> 00:07:02,873
- Derek?
- Not now.

138
00:07:02,946 --> 00:07:04,971
Let me know when you get
the CT report back.

139
00:07:08,184 --> 00:07:12,712
Marshall...
can you remember those words?

140
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:15,814
What happened?

141
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:25,965
And this is the father, Big Jim.

142
00:07:26,036 --> 00:07:29,528
I don't call him Big Jim.
The family, they call him Big Jim.

143
00:07:29,606 --> 00:07:31,233
Oh, stupid hicks.

144
00:07:31,308 --> 00:07:35,108
Really? Being Southern makes you
stupid? He owns half of Alabama.

145
00:07:35,178 --> 00:07:38,443
Yeah. And I bet he even washes his hands
after he pees.

146
00:07:38,515 --> 00:07:41,006
- That's uncalled for!
- This is a place of business.

147
00:07:41,084 --> 00:07:43,075
Discharge the mother and father.

148
00:07:43,153 --> 00:07:45,678
Karev, get the husband to the OR
for surgery.

149
00:07:45,755 --> 00:07:48,223
Dr. Karev, there you are.

150
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,226
<i>You're supposed to be up on the OBIG YN
rounding up my patients.</i>

151
00:07:51,294 --> 00:07:55,754
Oh, yeah, I got paged. 911. Pregnant
mom. Car accident. Very serious.

152
00:07:55,832 --> 00:07:57,595
Pity. I've got three surgeries.

153
00:07:57,667 --> 00:08:03,401
I was going to ask you to scrub in, but
you should stay with that pregnant lady.

154
00:08:03,473 --> 00:08:05,600
You see to it, Dr. Bailey?

155
00:08:08,111 --> 00:08:11,945
Karev, go find your patient. Stevens,
scrub in on Noah's patella fracture.

156
00:08:12,015 --> 00:08:14,745
The She-Shepherd just walks in
and pulls me off surgery?

157
00:08:14,818 --> 00:08:17,548
You burn the She-Shepherd,
she burns back. Go.

158
00:08:21,691 --> 00:08:26,025
- The CT won't hurt the baby or nothing?
- It won't hurt the baby... or nothing.

159
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,255
OK, on three. One, two, three, up.

160
00:08:29,332 --> 00:08:31,732
I was having a shower today.
A baby shower.

161
00:08:33,436 --> 00:08:36,997
That's why Mama and Daddy are in town.
Because I'm having a baby.

162
00:08:37,073 --> 00:08:39,405
- How nice is that?
- Nice.

163
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:41,068
- Isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

164
00:08:41,144 --> 00:08:43,635
- Why are you here?
- I'm captain of the vagina squad.

165
00:08:43,713 --> 00:08:47,149
This nice man is going to take care of
you now and he really likes to talk,

166
00:08:47,217 --> 00:08:49,242
- so chat away.
- It was nice meeting you.

167
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:52,049
- Not cool, Yang.
- What does she mean? Captain?

168
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:54,249
And what kind of squad are you on?

169
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,794
Uh, you shouldn't be reading
your own chart.

170
00:08:59,863 --> 00:09:03,560
I want to find out what caused me
to swerve my car into oncoming traffic

171
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:05,658
and not be able to remember it.

172
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:09,370
Those people, the ones I hit,
they're going to be OK, right?

173
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:13,034
- No serious complications?
- Uh, they're still checking them out.

174
00:09:14,644 --> 00:09:16,271
- Dr. Torres?
- Yeah?

175
00:09:16,346 --> 00:09:18,906
I heard you're performing
the Noah Reynolds surgery.

176
00:09:18,982 --> 00:09:20,916
- Yes.
- Well, I'm your intern.

177
00:09:20,984 --> 00:09:24,545
- So, whenever you're ready.
- OK, well, head up and prep the OR.

178
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:26,612
I need to put on a splint.

179
00:09:30,994 --> 00:09:34,191
- Um... did you wash your hands?
- What?

180
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:37,290
- You washed your hands, right?
- Of course I washed my hands.

181
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:39,665
No. No. Of course you did.

182
00:09:39,736 --> 00:09:42,637
Um, Marshall, this is going to hurt
a little bit, OK?

183
00:09:42,706 --> 00:09:46,233
My ETOH and tox screens were pristine

184
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:49,801
so I wasn't drinking or...
under the influence. Ow.

185
00:09:50,613 --> 00:09:52,672
OK, we get the CT result back yet?

186
00:09:52,749 --> 00:09:54,011
Not yet.

187
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:56,848
My GCS was 13. Why haven't I had a CT?

188
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,218
- Dr. Grey?
- CT was backed up.

189
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:03,157
- He's lucid now, so...
- So get it done! Now!

190
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:08,857
Hey. Daisy Duke's case
was boring me to tears.

191
00:10:08,932 --> 00:10:12,265
So, um, you got any good hearts
that I can cut open?

192
00:10:12,335 --> 00:10:15,532
Or, you know,
bad hearts that we can make good?

193
00:10:21,411 --> 00:10:24,903
Burke? Use words.

194
00:10:29,652 --> 00:10:31,279
You fell asleep.

195
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:36,189
- When?
- This morning. In the on-call room.

196
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:41,993
- I fell asleep after we, you know...
- Not after. Not after.

197
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,890
Oh.

198
00:10:46,202 --> 00:10:49,399
Oh. I'm... sorry.

199
00:10:49,472 --> 00:10:54,808
I... I was really tired. Seriously.
Seriously, my bad. I'm really sorry.

200
00:10:56,179 --> 00:10:59,114
- Don't let this threaten your manhood.
- Oh, this is not...

201
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,715
I am very confident in my manhood,
thank you very much.

202
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:06,221
Good, you should be, because, I mean...

203
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:12,023
I fell asleep because
I had already finished. Twice.

204
00:11:12,095 --> 00:11:15,121
I hadn't finished.

205
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,133
I was tired.
It's not like I did this on purpose.

206
00:11:20,203 --> 00:11:22,569
Did you stay in the hospital
last night on purpose?

207
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,335
- You weren't on-call.
- It was a paraesophageal hernia.

208
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:28,343
I had never seen one.
I'm a surgeon first, just like you.

209
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:31,437
No. No. Not just like me.
I am a person first.

210
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,914
Someone page me? Denny?

211
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:37,612
He collapsed.

212
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:39,678
What happened?

213
00:11:40,156 --> 00:11:42,989
- Too far, too fast.
- What were you doing?

214
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:45,027
Stairs.

215
00:11:45,094 --> 00:11:48,086
- Real bright, huh?
- Your LVAD battery is almost dead.

216
00:11:48,164 --> 00:11:50,189
Um, get him to his room,
I'll get Dr. Burke.

217
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:53,997
Let's get him up now.
Nice and easy on one, two, three.

218
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,130
Now, Denny,
you knew that LVAD wasn't a cure.

219
00:11:57,207 --> 00:12:00,574
I want to go home.
I want to go home yesterday.

220
00:12:00,643 --> 00:12:04,841
I know this is hard to hear, but that's
just not an option at this point.

221
00:12:04,914 --> 00:12:08,907
Since when do you get to decide what's
an option in my life and what isn't?

222
00:12:08,985 --> 00:12:14,184
My heart may be on your battery packs,
but it's still my heart.

223
00:12:14,257 --> 00:12:17,420
It's my decision. It's my damn life.

224
00:12:18,595 --> 00:12:20,256
That's right.

225
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,161
It is your life.

226
00:12:22,232 --> 00:12:23,995
And it is your life that is at stake.

227
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:27,594
And it is your life that will end if you
continue to push like you did today.

228
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,332
You said the LVAD would make me better.

229
00:12:30,406 --> 00:12:33,933
I told you the LVAD
would buy you more time. And it will.

230
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,570
If you respect its limitations
and your own.

231
00:12:39,182 --> 00:12:41,173
I want to go home.

232
00:12:44,988 --> 00:12:47,286
What do we do?

233
00:12:47,357 --> 00:12:49,348
We put him on a tight leash.

234
00:12:50,793 --> 00:12:52,852
Tell the nurses to keep an eye on him.

235
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:57,195
Make sure he doesn't take any more
endurance hikes in the stairwell.

236
00:12:57,267 --> 00:13:02,170
Yeah. But... Preston, what do we do?

237
00:13:03,072 --> 00:13:07,566
The damage to his body we can try to
control, but the damage to his spirit...

238
00:13:09,145 --> 00:13:13,514
For a man like Denny to lie on this bed
for years on end...

239
00:13:14,284 --> 00:13:17,583
That's not something
we could really understand.

240
00:13:17,654 --> 00:13:22,648
And his feelings about it aren't
something we should try to control.

241
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:28,492
Give him room, Izzie.
Just give him room to grieve.

242
00:13:35,638 --> 00:13:38,766
- You finally got Melanie to shut up?
- Finally. Thanks for that.

243
00:13:38,841 --> 00:13:41,241
- How's she doing?
- Images coming up now.

244
00:13:42,178 --> 00:13:46,615
- Ooh, is that a teardrop fracture?
- No head bleed, though. That's good.

245
00:13:46,683 --> 00:13:49,379
- Look at her lungs.
- Is that her liver?

246
00:13:49,452 --> 00:13:51,682
- Whoa!
- How is she alive?

247
00:13:51,754 --> 00:13:55,155
Karev, page Shepherd, Burke,
Montgomery-Shepherd, the Chief

248
00:13:55,224 --> 00:13:58,216
and every surgeon with an available hand
and get an OR opened.

249
00:13:58,294 --> 00:14:00,888
Go! Melanie? Mel...

250
00:14:00,964 --> 00:14:03,626
Get me a stretcher.
Let's pull her out of there now!

251
00:14:06,903 --> 00:14:08,894
Melanie?

252
00:14:15,244 --> 00:14:17,269
Hey, have you seen Izzie?

253
00:14:17,347 --> 00:14:21,283
She was supposed to prep an OR
for Noah's surgery and she bailed.

254
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:23,376
What?

255
00:14:24,153 --> 00:14:27,122
- Mr. And Mrs. Johnson?
- Dr. O'Malley!

256
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,684
That little girl right there says she's
going to fix Noah's leg all by herself.

257
00:14:31,761 --> 00:14:35,219
And she just gave him a big old
shot for his pain. I really like her.

258
00:14:35,298 --> 00:14:38,131
Mr. And Mrs. Johnson? Big Jim?

259
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,500
- Is it Mel?
- Yes, ma'am, it is.

260
00:14:46,576 --> 00:14:48,009
What? What?

261
00:14:48,678 --> 00:14:50,771
When your daughter came into the OR,

262
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:54,112
her body was over-pumping
her bloodstream with adrenaline,

263
00:14:54,183 --> 00:14:57,277
which kept her conscious and alert
and, uh, pain-free.

264
00:14:57,353 --> 00:15:00,254
During the CT scan, she was still
for a longer period of time

265
00:15:00,323 --> 00:15:02,086
and so her body relaxed.

266
00:15:02,158 --> 00:15:06,117
And the adrenaline stopped flowing,
which allowed her to succumb

267
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:08,993
to the full extent
of her injuries, which...

268
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:11,966
They're catastrophic.

269
00:15:13,836 --> 00:15:15,804
Excuse me?

270
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,682
Bovie.

271
00:15:36,392 --> 00:15:39,418
More suction here. Clamp.

272
00:15:39,495 --> 00:15:41,258
Internal saw.

273
00:15:45,768 --> 00:15:47,759
- Karev, sit down.
- I can't see.

274
00:15:48,704 --> 00:15:51,434
The only thing I want you to do
is sit at that fetal monitor

275
00:15:51,507 --> 00:15:53,441
and watch that baby's heartbeat.

276
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:55,636
So now I'm a baby-sitter?

277
00:16:02,618 --> 00:16:03,812
Retractor.

278
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,053
Addison, we're ready for you.

279
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:15,324
We are going to do
everything we can.

280
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,500
Uterus is protected. Baby's heartbeat?

281
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:24,904
146.

282
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:30,274
OK, baby's safe.
You can proceed with the mother.

283
00:16:32,148 --> 00:16:35,015
Lungs are damaged pretty badly.

284
00:16:35,084 --> 00:16:37,382
Pressure just bottomed out.

285
00:16:37,453 --> 00:16:39,512
Let's transfuse.

286
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:43,025
Four quadrant packing!
Come on, people, get me some lap pads.

287
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:45,890
- Cross clamp the aorta.
- Clamp. Got it.

288
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:48,692
There's too much bleeding.
Shepherd?

289
00:16:48,764 --> 00:16:50,891
- Damage control.
- Addison?

290
00:16:50,967 --> 00:16:53,231
If you want the baby to live,
damage control.

291
00:16:53,302 --> 00:16:55,736
- Burke?
- Damage control.

292
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:58,569
Everyone knows the rules.
We move as rapidly as possible.

293
00:16:58,641 --> 00:17:02,873
Don't worry about finishing repairs.
Crisis management, just get it done.

294
00:17:02,945 --> 00:17:06,608
Once she reaches the triangle,
we stop. No exceptions.

295
00:17:06,682 --> 00:17:08,650
Why's he talking about triangle?

296
00:17:08,718 --> 00:17:12,381
Blood stops clotting, her muscles
produce acid and her organs get cold.

297
00:17:12,455 --> 00:17:14,753
You're talking about
the triangle of death?

298
00:17:19,729 --> 00:17:22,664
A ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.

299
00:17:22,732 --> 00:17:24,097
What?

300
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:27,398
I scrubbed in
on an abdominal aortic aneurysm.

301
00:17:28,337 --> 00:17:30,305
It was a 12-hour surgery.

302
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:33,433
I had already worked 30 hours,
but I didn't want to miss it.

303
00:17:36,078 --> 00:17:39,411
I fell asleep for... a second
behind the wheel.

304
00:17:39,482 --> 00:17:42,747
I closed my eyes for a second
at the red light. A second.

305
00:17:47,757 --> 00:17:49,748
It was only 12 hours.

306
00:17:50,626 --> 00:17:52,287
I'd done it before.

307
00:17:52,361 --> 00:17:54,488
We've all done it before.

308
00:17:54,564 --> 00:17:56,293
Dr. Grey?

309
00:17:56,365 --> 00:17:58,492
- Meredith.
- Meredith.

310
00:18:00,136 --> 00:18:02,161
Does this mean...

311
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:05,605
Are we actually saying that, uh...

312
00:18:05,675 --> 00:18:07,404
today...

313
00:18:07,476 --> 00:18:09,341
this morning...

314
00:18:09,412 --> 00:18:12,870
because I stayed in the OR
to save a life...

315
00:18:14,684 --> 00:18:17,209
I may have killed a pregnant woman?

316
00:18:17,286 --> 00:18:20,881
Dr. Grey?

317
00:18:20,957 --> 00:18:23,187
You ordered a CT on Marshall Stone?

318
00:18:25,127 --> 00:18:29,291
- We're going to need a moment.
- I'm backed up here with five patients.

319
00:18:29,365 --> 00:18:31,663
We need a moment.

320
00:18:34,537 --> 00:18:35,799
Marshall?

321
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:40,235
Marshall?

322
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:42,709
- Izzie, please.
- Come on, Denny, just...

323
00:18:42,778 --> 00:18:44,075
- Izzie.
- Smell.

324
00:18:44,146 --> 00:18:46,239
Smell. Chocolate.

325
00:18:46,315 --> 00:18:48,613
And not the crappy,
processed, waxy kind,

326
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:50,948
but the good Swiss chocolate
from the gift shop

327
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,648
that costs way too much money,
but is totally worth it.

328
00:18:53,723 --> 00:18:58,888
Try it. And exhibit B. Tabloids.

329
00:18:58,961 --> 00:19:02,260
Good old-fashioned
trashy celebrity gossip rags.

330
00:19:02,331 --> 00:19:04,492
Damn it, Izzie, stop it!

331
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:06,860
Just stop it!

332
00:19:08,104 --> 00:19:10,902
You think
I'm feeling sorry for myself, right?

333
00:19:10,973 --> 00:19:14,033
Poor sad sack Denny
just needs a little perspective.

334
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,941
You do need a little perspective.

335
00:19:16,012 --> 00:19:20,346
You have no idea
what it is to lose what I have lost.

336
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:23,977
- I know loss, Denny.
- No you don't!

337
00:19:25,488 --> 00:19:27,285
I'm a man.

338
00:19:27,356 --> 00:19:30,484
I'm a strong, virile horse of a man

339
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,392
stuck in the body
of some weak, sick bastard

340
00:19:33,462 --> 00:19:36,192
that I don't know, like, or recognize.

341
00:19:36,265 --> 00:19:39,200
Now if you knew what that feels like,

342
00:19:39,268 --> 00:19:42,760
you would have never convinced me
to let a battery run my heart.

343
00:19:42,838 --> 00:19:45,432
If you knew what it feels like, Izzie...

344
00:19:46,942 --> 00:19:48,933
you would have let me go.

345
00:19:52,982 --> 00:19:56,383
- Systolic's 82. No better.
- How's the spleen, Chief?

346
00:19:56,452 --> 00:19:59,546
- Unsalvageable, I'm afraid.
- Karev!

347
00:19:59,622 --> 00:20:01,954
Frequent decels and loss of variability.

348
00:20:02,024 --> 00:20:06,552
- The baby's fading.
- PH is down 7.1. Core temp 93 degrees.

349
00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:09,826
OK, we've reached
the triangle, people. Hands out.

350
00:20:09,899 --> 00:20:10,991
Still oozing.

351
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:13,831
- We're not trying for perfection!
- Just give me a second.

352
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:15,894
Damn it, stop! Everybody stop!

353
00:20:18,474 --> 00:20:20,738
Cristina, let it go.

354
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:26,946
Slow. Erratic. But it's a heartbeat.

355
00:20:27,016 --> 00:20:29,041
Baby's holding steady.

356
00:20:29,118 --> 00:20:31,018
Bring out the plastic.

357
00:20:31,087 --> 00:20:33,055
Plastic? We're not going to close?

358
00:20:33,122 --> 00:20:37,957
We're going to keep her open, cover her
with plastic, and get her to the ICU.

359
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:41,190
- And then what?
- Then we'll see if she survives.

360
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,270
OK.
We'll take care of you, all right?

361
00:21:00,216 --> 00:21:03,151
How the hell do you let a patient
get that far off your watch?

362
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:06,154
- I turned my back for a second.
- He was in the damned gallery!

363
00:21:06,222 --> 00:21:09,953
- He's a surgical intern...
- I don't care if he's surgeon general.

364
00:21:10,025 --> 00:21:14,121
In this hospital, he's a patient
with a head injury who needs a CT.

365
00:21:14,196 --> 00:21:17,688
In this hospital, he's a scared guy
who does not need to see

366
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:21,203
the massive internal injuries
of the woman he rammed with his car!

367
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,330
This is your fault.
You had him and you lost him!

368
00:21:25,474 --> 00:21:29,342
You got to take responsibility
for your actions for once in your life!

369
00:21:29,412 --> 00:21:30,674
Derek!

370
00:21:41,924 --> 00:21:45,121
We've given her medications
to help her blood clot

371
00:21:45,194 --> 00:21:47,754
and to help counteract the acid buildup.

372
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:51,163
We're slowly raising her body
temperature with warming blankets,

373
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:53,929
warmed IV fluids, and blood products.

374
00:21:54,003 --> 00:21:57,234
How long is she going
to have to be like that?

375
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,565
You know, with... Open like that?

376
00:22:00,643 --> 00:22:04,704
We want her to regain as much strength
as possible before we operate again.

377
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,238
But at the same time, we want to repair
the damage as soon as possible.

378
00:22:08,317 --> 00:22:10,376
So it's a balancing act.

379
00:22:10,453 --> 00:22:13,945
I'm sorry.
I don't quite know what you mean.

380
00:22:14,023 --> 00:22:18,221
Melanie will die if we don't get her
back to surgery soon enough.

381
00:22:18,294 --> 00:22:22,628
And Melanie will die
if we take her back to surgery too soon.

382
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:25,967
A balancing act.

383
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:28,367
A balancing act.

384
00:22:35,377 --> 00:22:38,369
Uh, Yang,
call me if she starts actively bleeding.

385
00:22:38,447 --> 00:22:39,812
OK.

386
00:22:41,617 --> 00:22:43,346
Karev. Where are you going?

387
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:45,853
What? She's in ICU.
There's nothing I can do.

388
00:22:45,921 --> 00:22:48,253
You can sit and watch
that fetal monitor.

389
00:22:48,324 --> 00:22:50,986
You can't be serious.
She's circling the drain.

390
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:55,019
You know how long a baby can survive
inside its dead mother? Five minutes.

391
00:22:55,097 --> 00:22:57,497
Minutes not seconds, Karev.

392
00:22:57,566 --> 00:23:01,002
Look at Melanie. Look at her.

393
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,096
Now look around. All the doctors
and nurses, even her parents.

394
00:23:04,173 --> 00:23:08,109
Their sole job is to care of Melanie.
My job is to care for that baby.

395
00:23:08,177 --> 00:23:11,772
I have a surgery scheduled, so when
I step foot on that elevator and leave,

396
00:23:11,847 --> 00:23:14,839
you are going to be the only person
on this entire floor

397
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:16,782
responsible for that baby.

398
00:23:16,852 --> 00:23:19,150
Do not let me down, Karev.

399
00:23:21,891 --> 00:23:26,851
Her organs are bleeding, damaged,
exposed, and covered in plastic wrap.

400
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:29,489
Poor Marshall.
I mean, one minute you're a surgeon,

401
00:23:29,565 --> 00:23:32,056
the next you've destroyed
an entire family.

402
00:23:32,134 --> 00:23:34,898
Last month,
I fell asleep in the parking lot.

403
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,370
On a bench.
I couldn't even make it to the car.

404
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:41,273
I fell asleep at a restaurant.
At a table while I was on a date.

405
00:23:41,343 --> 00:23:44,369
- I fell asleep during sex.
- Izzie.

406
00:23:44,446 --> 00:23:47,381
Hey, Callie's looking for you.
You blew off her surgery.

407
00:23:47,449 --> 00:23:50,441
No. I... I had a patient. Denny.
I... I had to go.

408
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:52,885
- You were hanging out with Denny?
- Oh, please.

409
00:23:52,955 --> 00:23:56,083
Do not talk to me about standards.
She can't even wash her hands.

410
00:24:02,131 --> 00:24:03,996
Don't worry about Bambi.

411
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:08,127
If Burke forgave me for sleeping during
sex, George can forgive you for crying.

412
00:24:08,203 --> 00:24:10,228
But Burke hasn't forgiven you.

413
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,048
I found Izzie.
She said she had a patient.

414
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,415
- I knew you'd take her side.
- What?

415
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,957
He needs an IV.

416
00:24:33,028 --> 00:24:34,052
Are you...

417
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:39,126
She's mad at you.

418
00:24:39,201 --> 00:24:41,226
I... I didn't know you were awake.

419
00:24:42,071 --> 00:24:44,631
- What did you do?
- Uh, has...

420
00:24:45,507 --> 00:24:48,999
Has anyone talked to you
about your wife? About what's happening?

421
00:24:50,713 --> 00:24:52,943
What's happening? Uh...

422
00:24:53,015 --> 00:24:58,510
You know, I can't really, uh,
wrap my brain around what's happening.

423
00:24:59,121 --> 00:25:02,921
You know, I'm from here.
Uh, Seattle.

424
00:25:02,992 --> 00:25:06,393
And, uh... you know,
I go away to college

425
00:25:06,462 --> 00:25:07,793
and I come back

426
00:25:07,863 --> 00:25:13,665
married to this big-haired,
drawling Southern girl.

427
00:25:14,603 --> 00:25:16,969
And everyone I know thinks I'm crazy.

428
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,030
But I love her.

429
00:25:19,842 --> 00:25:23,938
I just... I love her.

430
00:25:25,648 --> 00:25:29,311
And, uh... what's happening

431
00:25:29,385 --> 00:25:34,789
is that my... big-haired Southern girl

432
00:25:36,091 --> 00:25:37,456
could be dying.

433
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:41,519
And... I can't think about that.

434
00:25:41,597 --> 00:25:44,293
You know, I need...
I need to think about something else.

435
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:46,926
I mean, it doesn't... matter so much.

436
00:25:47,002 --> 00:25:50,028
Something that doesn't...
doesn't have me

437
00:25:50,105 --> 00:25:55,771
burying my 22-year-old wife and baby.

438
00:25:58,914 --> 00:26:01,075
So, uh, so...

439
00:26:01,717 --> 00:26:04,015
What the hell did you do?

440
00:26:06,588 --> 00:26:10,684
I believed my friend when she told me
that Dr. Torres doesn't wash her hands.

441
00:26:13,896 --> 00:26:15,887
Well, I hope that's not true.

442
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:21,368
Seeing as she just, uh...
performed surgery on me and all.

443
00:26:21,437 --> 00:26:23,200
Yeah.

444
00:26:24,206 --> 00:26:26,538
- You paged me.
- CT results.

445
00:26:26,608 --> 00:26:30,669
Good, thank you. All right,
let's see what we've got here.

446
00:26:33,048 --> 00:26:35,107
Marshall, everything checks out fine.

447
00:26:35,184 --> 00:26:38,153
Your short-term memory loss
was a result of the concussion.

448
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,054
But to be safe, I want to keep you here
overnight for observation, all right?

449
00:26:42,624 --> 00:26:44,717
I have to apologize.

450
00:26:44,793 --> 00:26:46,021
What?

451
00:26:46,862 --> 00:26:49,057
To the woman's family.

452
00:26:49,732 --> 00:26:52,633
I have to tell them
I'm sorry for what I did.

453
00:26:54,036 --> 00:26:56,027
You should get some rest.

454
00:27:06,048 --> 00:27:08,573
I never should have told you
about George.

455
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,948
No, it's fine, I'm glad I know.
About him.

456
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:13,419
And the vet. You really get around.

457
00:27:13,489 --> 00:27:16,083
- What did you just say to me?
- It's unforgivable.

458
00:27:16,158 --> 00:27:18,683
I don't remember
ever asking you to forgive me.

459
00:27:18,761 --> 00:27:21,753
So was the knitting a phase?
Who's next? Alex?

460
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,560
Because I hear
he likes to sleep around.

461
00:27:24,633 --> 00:27:26,328
You two have that in common.

462
00:27:28,437 --> 00:27:30,530
You don't get to call me a whore.

463
00:27:30,606 --> 00:27:33,598
When I met you,
I thought I had found the person

464
00:27:33,675 --> 00:27:37,441
that I was going to spend
the rest of my life with! I was done.

465
00:27:37,513 --> 00:27:42,109
So all the boys and all the bars and all
the obvious daddy issues, who cared?

466
00:27:42,184 --> 00:27:44,311
Because I was done.

467
00:27:44,386 --> 00:27:48,083
You left me. You chose Addison.

468
00:27:48,157 --> 00:27:51,126
I'm all glued back together now.

469
00:27:51,193 --> 00:27:56,790
I make no apologies for how
I chose to repair what you broke.

470
00:27:56,865 --> 00:27:59,333
You don't get to call me a whore.

471
00:28:06,542 --> 00:28:10,103
This thing with us is finished.
It's over.

472
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:12,306
Finally.

473
00:28:12,381 --> 00:28:15,248
- Yeah. It's done.
- It is done.

474
00:28:32,801 --> 00:28:37,738
Her temperature is 95.4 degrees
and her pH is 7.28.

475
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:42,370
Definitely clotting better.

476
00:28:42,444 --> 00:28:45,345
But some of the wounds are still oozing.

477
00:28:45,414 --> 00:28:50,317
Well, still a fine line.
She may not be quite stable enough.

478
00:28:50,385 --> 00:28:55,015
Y'all don't have to whisper. I'm sitting
right here. I can hear you anyway.

479
00:28:56,658 --> 00:28:58,558
And she's my baby.

480
00:28:59,428 --> 00:29:01,692
She's my little girl.

481
00:29:01,763 --> 00:29:04,789
It's a big decision like this.

482
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:10,703
Going back in. Sewing up her... organs.

483
00:29:10,772 --> 00:29:14,833
It's the kind of decision
that a mama ought to be involved in.

484
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:19,609
I mean, all her life,
she's asked me everything.

485
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:24,311
From... what color dress she ought
to wear to her kindergarten dance

486
00:29:24,386 --> 00:29:27,082
to what she ought to name her baby.

487
00:29:28,757 --> 00:29:30,748
Because I'm her mama.

488
00:29:31,426 --> 00:29:37,296
And it's my job to have an opinion.
It's my job to have an answer.

489
00:29:41,203 --> 00:29:46,231
I may not have an answer here,
but... I'm still her mama.

490
00:29:46,308 --> 00:29:48,299
You just don't have to whisper.

491
00:29:51,013 --> 00:29:53,379
All right.

492
00:29:54,683 --> 00:29:56,378
What do you think, Dr. Bailey?

493
00:29:56,451 --> 00:30:02,651
I think if we wait much longer
she'll go into multiple organ failure.

494
00:30:04,459 --> 00:30:07,826
OK. If it's all right with you,
Mrs. Johnson,

495
00:30:07,896 --> 00:30:10,831
we think it's time
to go and finish what we started.

496
00:30:13,936 --> 00:30:17,463
OK. I'm done.

497
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:20,770
Yang. Come and start
washing out the abdominal cavity.

498
00:30:20,842 --> 00:30:23,902
Bleeding's controlled in the chest.

499
00:30:23,979 --> 00:30:27,107
- Fetal heart rate's down to 80!
- Mom's heart rate's slowing down.

500
00:30:27,182 --> 00:30:30,208
- 48 and dropping.
- Ruptured retroperitoneal hematoma.

501
00:30:30,285 --> 00:30:33,721
- She's bleeding out!
- Idioventricular rhythm. Any BP?

502
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:35,416
Trying. Nothing's registering.

503
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:37,685
Yang, get your hands in here
and hold pressure.

504
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:40,057
- Fetal heart rate at 60!
- Heart's fibrillating.

505
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,892
- Can you see the source of the bleed?
- Internal paddles.

506
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,291
- We're losing the baby!
- Charge to 20! Clear!

507
00:30:55,043 --> 00:30:57,375
We're chasing our tails.
Get Addison Shepherd!

508
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:04,610
- Melanie's crashing.
- It's right there.

509
00:31:04,686 --> 00:31:06,916
You hear me? She's crashing.

510
00:31:06,989 --> 00:31:09,890
I'm elbow deep in a patient's uterus.
What do you want me to do?

511
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:12,859
- Leave her and her child to die?
- I'm doing my job.

512
00:31:12,928 --> 00:31:17,627
And I'm doing mine. Do what you can.
I'll be there as soon as I'm done.

513
00:31:17,699 --> 00:31:19,929
OK, people, let's speed it up!

514
00:31:36,184 --> 00:31:40,553
They'll know where to find us...
when there's news?

515
00:31:41,356 --> 00:31:43,847
They'll know we're here?

516
00:31:43,925 --> 00:31:45,517
Yes, ma'am.

517
00:31:45,594 --> 00:31:48,825
Good. OK. OK.

518
00:31:48,897 --> 00:31:53,095
Is there something I should be doing,
someone I should talk with? Something?

519
00:31:53,168 --> 00:31:55,602
You're doing everything you can do,
Big Jim.

520
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,518
I know this isn't the best time,

521
00:32:10,585 --> 00:32:12,780
but Marshall would very much like
the chance

522
00:32:12,854 --> 00:32:16,415
to apologize to the family
if they'll let him.

523
00:32:17,993 --> 00:32:19,984
He's one of us, George.

524
00:32:29,704 --> 00:32:32,104
Shepherd's still in surgery.
I told her to hurry.

525
00:32:32,174 --> 00:32:35,473
- How's her heart?
- Asystole.

526
00:32:37,112 --> 00:32:39,205
- How long has she been down?
- Five minutes.

527
00:32:46,354 --> 00:32:48,652
Well, I'm gonna do a C-section. Glove.

528
00:32:48,723 --> 00:32:52,352
I need to get that baby out.
Tell me what to do.

529
00:32:54,096 --> 00:32:59,193
Yang. We're going to...
pack away the intestines.

530
00:32:59,267 --> 00:33:02,532
- I'll expose the uterus.
- OK, call Pediatrics!

531
00:33:02,604 --> 00:33:05,505
Open the uterus
with a midline vertical incision.

532
00:33:05,574 --> 00:33:07,565
Make sure you don't cut the fetus.

533
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,512
OK, go.

534
00:33:21,623 --> 00:33:26,083
Baby doesn't look good.
How are we doing on the mother?

535
00:33:26,161 --> 00:33:28,891
Oh, she's still bleeding
pretty profusely.

536
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:34,564
Hmm. I can't get it controlled.

537
00:33:34,636 --> 00:33:35,933
Burke?

538
00:33:39,641 --> 00:33:41,905
She's not coming back.

539
00:33:42,844 --> 00:33:44,641
Let's stop.

540
00:33:56,391 --> 00:33:58,951
Time of death, 19:48.

541
00:33:59,027 --> 00:34:00,392
Chief?

542
00:34:56,818 --> 00:34:58,547
I am sorry.

543
00:35:03,525 --> 00:35:05,789
I am...

544
00:35:07,229 --> 00:35:09,288
I am so...

545
00:35:10,665 --> 00:35:12,826
so sorry.

546
00:35:20,575 --> 00:35:22,509
Please.

547
00:36:36,718 --> 00:36:38,879
You're going to get in trouble.

548
00:36:38,953 --> 00:36:40,648
I don't care.

549
00:36:42,724 --> 00:36:45,124
I'm not going to cheer up for you.

550
00:36:46,961 --> 00:36:49,156
You don't have to cheer up.

551
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,221
I'm not here for me.

552
00:36:53,034 --> 00:36:56,265
I'm here for you. OK?

553
00:36:59,274 --> 00:37:00,798
OK.

554
00:37:03,044 --> 00:37:06,207
<i>We're all damaged, it seems.</i>

555
00:37:09,217 --> 00:37:11,208
<i>Some of us more than others.</i>

556
00:37:13,555 --> 00:37:15,682
You must be tired.

557
00:37:17,058 --> 00:37:18,616
Yeah.

558
00:37:23,431 --> 00:37:25,661
I'm tired too.

559
00:37:35,777 --> 00:37:39,474
<i>We carry the damage with us
from childhood.</i>

560
00:37:48,256 --> 00:37:54,126
<i>Then, as grown-ups,
we give as good as we get.</i>

561
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,454
Good work, Karev.

562
00:37:59,768 --> 00:38:02,965
Yeah. Kid's alive. Without a mother.

563
00:38:06,474 --> 00:38:09,602
<i>Ultimately, we all do damage.</i>

564
00:38:21,523 --> 00:38:23,457
See you at home?

565
00:38:23,525 --> 00:38:25,186
Yeah.

566
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,285
- OK. See you.
- OK.

567
00:38:30,498 --> 00:38:32,193
<i>And then...</i>

568
00:38:32,267 --> 00:38:37,136
<i>we set about the business
of fixing... whatever we can.</i>

569
00:38:38,706 --> 00:38:40,867
Izzie?

570
00:38:40,942 --> 00:38:42,307
Hmm?

571
00:38:44,946 --> 00:38:48,177
Would it be wrong
for me to feel you up right now?

572
00:38:48,249 --> 00:38:50,774
Hmm. Not so much.

573
00:38:57,725 --> 00:38:59,716
Such a dirty boy.

574
00:39:01,463 --> 00:39:03,158
- I know.
- Hmm.

575
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,693
I washed my hands. I... I went down to
the kitchen and I washed my hands.

576
00:39:09,771 --> 00:39:11,966
I didn't wash my hands in the bathroom

577
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,771
because those girls were staring at me
like I was a rodent or something.

578
00:39:15,844 --> 00:39:19,371
Like I was in high school
and I was... having the naked dream,

579
00:39:19,447 --> 00:39:21,642
only it was actually happening.

580
00:39:22,784 --> 00:39:24,877
I didn't even know they were home.

581
00:39:26,888 --> 00:39:28,583
I washed my hands.

582
00:39:44,405 --> 00:39:46,930
You have to stand up for me.

583
00:39:47,008 --> 00:39:50,603
You have to say I washed my hands.

584
00:40:02,557 --> 00:40:04,149
I'm sorry.

585
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:11,094
You're driving me crazy
with the hovering.

586
00:40:15,803 --> 00:40:17,771
This could be a mistake.

587
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,534
This. Us.

588
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:25,270
You're a really nice guy and... well...

589
00:40:25,346 --> 00:40:28,509
you... you don't want to
get involved with me.

590
00:40:29,751 --> 00:40:31,582
- If you knew me...
- Scary.

591
00:40:31,653 --> 00:40:34,713
- Finn.
- And damaged. See? I told you.

592
00:40:35,323 --> 00:40:39,885
If you knew me? If you knew my family?

593
00:40:39,961 --> 00:40:43,761
If I told you the guys
that I've slept with lately?

594
00:40:44,832 --> 00:40:48,962
The scary and damage may
actually be more than you can handle.

595
00:40:52,707 --> 00:40:54,538
My mother's dead.

596
00:40:54,609 --> 00:40:58,636
She got cancer when I was ten
and she suffered for a really long time.

597
00:40:58,713 --> 00:41:00,578
And then she died.

598
00:41:00,648 --> 00:41:02,843
And my father never recovered.

599
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:04,851
It's kind of like he died with her,

600
00:41:04,919 --> 00:41:09,117
except that his body's above-ground and
permanently placed in front of the TV

601
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,283
with a bottle of Scotch in his lap.

602
00:41:12,393 --> 00:41:17,524
The last woman I slept with was my wife,
but she died too.

603
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,965
It was a car crash, so it was quick.

604
00:41:20,034 --> 00:41:22,298
She didn't suffer, which I appreciated.

605
00:41:23,871 --> 00:41:26,362
Don't worry.

606
00:41:26,441 --> 00:41:31,037
I'm thinking that my luck is beginning
to change because I've met you.

607
00:41:31,813 --> 00:41:35,977
And you like dogs
and you enjoy pony births,

608
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,610
and you have the ability to save lives.

609
00:41:43,758 --> 00:41:46,386
I never said I wasn't
scary and damaged too.
