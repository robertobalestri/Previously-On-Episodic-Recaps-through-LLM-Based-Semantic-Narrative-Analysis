1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,559
<i> Gratitude.</i>

2
00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:04,694
<i>Appreciation.</i>

3
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,432
<i>Giving thanks.</i>

4
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,497
<i>No matter what words you use,</i>

5
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,702
<i>it all means the same thing.</i>

6
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:12,806
<i>Happy.</i>

7
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,506
<i>We're supposed to be happy.</i>

8
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:21,452
<i>Grateful for friends, family,</i>

9
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,920
<i>happy to just be alive...</i>

10
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:23,978
Hey!

11
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,615
<i>... whether we like it or not.</i>

12
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,626
What are you doing?

13
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,888
Answering the door.

14
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:32,988
- You're going to the hospital?
- Yes, but...

15
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:36,832
Everyone is supposed to
help me make dinner. It's Thanksgiving!

16
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,768
I'm really not in the mood.

17
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:41,432
- But it's like a family...
- Doorbell.

18
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,072
- This where Georgie lives?
- Georgie?

19
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:51,948
- O'Malley. Where is he, upstairs?
- Oh. George. Yeah.

20
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,610
O'Malley!

21
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,280
O- Mal-ley! O-Mal-ley!

22
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:59,154
- Should I call the police?
- O'Malley!

23
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:05,291
Meredith! I'm serious! You need to be
back here for dinner at 6:00! I mean it!

24
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:09,267
Five... four... three... two...

25
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:12,498
Happy Thanksgiving!

26
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:19,409
Hey, you.

27
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,039
I saw you from the window and...

28
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,606
Looked like you could use
a wake up call.

29
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,886
I thought you moved to a hotel
closer to the hospital.

30
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:32,149
You still at Bainbridge?

31
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,692
Mm-hmm.

32
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,194
Yeah,

33
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,889
I had a thing for ferryboats.

34
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,162
Always with the mocking.

35
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:50,072
So, I was thinking that we could...

36
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,506
have sex tonight.

37
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:55,841
Yeah.

38
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,713
Look, I know we're both
going to feel weird about it.

39
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,483
- And it's the first time...
- Since Mark?

40
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,251
And Meredith.

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,926
I have the day off.
Do you have the day off?

42
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,726
Just stop by the hospital,
I have patients I need to check on.

43
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,326
If you have the day off,
what are you doing here?

44
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:20,065
Was thinking we could have sex tonight.

45
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,405
I made a reservation at noon,
I figure we can do Thanksgiving,

46
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:28,709
and then, I don't know,
just rip the stitches, get it over with.

47
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,476
No anesthesia?

48
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,644
Right. What do you think?

49
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,391
Remember med school?

50
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,018
We spent Thanksgiving studying

51
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,757
and eating really bad Chinese food
instead of turkey.

52
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:49,398
Too busy and too tired
to even think about cooking.

53
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,300
We never had to schedule sex.

54
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,564
Not once.

55
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,674
Derek, I want get through this. I do.

56
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,839
I want things to be normal again.

57
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,076
So will you meet me at noon?

58
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,720
Yeah, OK. I'll see you at noon.

59
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:12,656
Grey. We're working with
a temp attending today, Dr. Kent.

60
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:15,888
He's subbing in from Mercy West.
We need to get him oriented.

61
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,896
Thank you for volunteering to come in.

62
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,797
Saved me from having to choose
an intern to torture.

63
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,858
Happy to be tortured.

64
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,029
Not a fan of Thanksgiving?

65
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:27,595
Not a whole hell of a lot
to be thankful for.

66
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:31,166
I like Thanksgiving. It's a day
people spend with their families.

67
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:34,042
Too much family time
triggers depression,

68
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:37,947
repressed childhood rage,
bitter disputes over the remote

69
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,951
and way too much alcohol.

70
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,045
People get stupid,
people get violent, people get hurt.

71
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:46,489
- And that's a good thing because...
- Surgeries, Grey.

72
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,120
- Lots and lots of surgeries.
- I never thought of that.

73
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:54,792
The stupidity of the human race, Grey.
Be thankful for that.

74
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,838
- You're supposed to be at home.
- So are you.

75
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,467
Best maze procedure I've ever done.

76
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,977
- Under an hour.
- I thought you had the day off.

77
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:07,945
I did. I do. I'm leaving.

78
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:11,006
I simply like to start my day cutting,
gives me a rush.

79
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,349
Admit it. You can't function
ten feet away from the hospital.

80
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,355
- I notice you're both here.
- Well, I'm here for an hour.

81
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:21,291
- I'm on my way home.
- Ah. Say it like you mean it.

82
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,854
I know how to have a life
outside this hospital.

83
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,695
Damn right you do.

84
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:29,861
- Dr. Kent?
- Yes?

85
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,496
I'm the surgical resident
assisting you today.

86
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:36,508
I know you're subbing in from Mercy
West, so if there's anything I can do...

87
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,703
I'm here one day.
I don't need my ass kissed.

88
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,305
I'll just tell you what to do,
and you do it. I don't like mistakes.

89
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,316
- I don't make mistakes.
- Whatever.

90
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:48,821
There's only one resident I want in
my OR. Guy they call the Nazi. Know him?

91
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,879
The Nazi?

92
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,051
Gets great word of mouth. Stellar rep.
Balls the size of Texas.

93
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,492
That big?

94
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:58,496
Sounds like an
impressively talented man, this Nazi.

95
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:01,692
- Do you know him or not?
- Never heard of him.

96
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,862
- But I'll keep an eye out.
- For now, work on smaller cases.

97
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:08,395
A guy just came in to curtain three.
Page me if you get confused.

98
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,465
I'll be sure to do that.

99
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,538
Like I said,
the stupidity of the human race.

100
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:20,450
Hurry up, Georgie. There's a turkey
out there with your name on it.

101
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:23,616
Whoa! Hey!

102
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,454
Hey, where are you going?
Where are you going?

103
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:30,656
Every year, my father, my brothers and I
hunt, shoot and kill a helpless turkey.

104
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,890
Isn't that great?

105
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:34,398
- O'Malley!
- What about dinner?

106
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,368
We'll have him back
as soon as he kills his first bird.

107
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,702
This is the year Georgie
becomes a man. Right, Georgie?

108
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,435
I can't make dinner myself.
Who's going to help me?

109
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,170
Who's going to help me?

110
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,249
Holden McKee.
Brought in from Mayfield Nursing Home.

111
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,251
Mayfield? He's in the garden?

112
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,877
- Garden?
- Vegetable.

113
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:59,084
His chart says he fell into a persistent
vegetative state 16 years ago.

114
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:03,595
He was a firefighter injured
by falling debris in the line of duty.

115
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,062
What brings him here?

116
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,895
Fell from his bed
while being turned by orderlies.

117
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,128
Insurance says
he has to be checked out.

118
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,229
Temporoparietal scalp lac
with associated hematoma.

119
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,967
What's your plan?

120
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,669
Irrigate and explore the wound.
Repair the lac.

121
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:22,078
A CT to rule out intra-cerebral
hemorrhage, contusion or cerebral edema.

122
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,879
Go to it. If anybody asks,
I'm off looking for the Nazi.

123
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,885
OK.

124
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,048
It's just me and you.

125
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,225
I'd give anything
for your kind of serenity.

126
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:45,031
Great. Now I'm jealous of vegetables.

127
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,131
You just look so peaceful.

128
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,346
Dr. Bailey.

129
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,186
This guy's got third-degree burns
over half his body.

130
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,816
Tried to deep-fry a turkey.

131
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,521
Course, he got drunk first.
Gonna be good. You want in?

132
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:13,258
My PVS case? He opened his eyes.
And I think he was looking at me.

133
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:18,127
- He wasn't looking at you.
- No, he was.

134
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,729
- Anything good?
- Uh...

135
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,002
Nothing you want to waste time on.

136
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,441
There are 13 patients that need sutures.

137
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,911
She's the intern.
She can do the sutures.

138
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,814
Actually, she's on her way to CT
with a VIP patient.

139
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:35,047
- On orders from the Nazi.
- Tell him I'm looking for him.

140
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,489
The burn unit is waiting for him.
I'll meet in the OR.

141
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,289
Grey, get a CT, have neuro consult.

142
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,989
But trust me, he wasn't looking at you.

143
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,631
Don't mention Shepherd.
Or Montgomery-Shepherd.

144
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,466
Or the fact that Shepherd
is with Montgomery-Shepherd.

145
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,735
- OK.
- Or anything to do with syphilis.

146
00:07:56,876 --> 00:08:00,437
- I've been in social situations before.
- Yeah, well, not with me.

147
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,504
Well, why are we here?

148
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,777
Just be nice or something.

149
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,417
It's half-past ten. You're late.
I've had to try to do all this...

150
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,684
Oh. Hi, Dr. Burke. Hello.

151
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,087
Oh.

152
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,894
What was I supposed to do?
Blow off my boyfriend for Thanksgiving?

153
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,703
I tried to.
He wouldn't blow.

154
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,365
He's like something sticky
that won't blow off.

155
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,432
OK, he's going to ruin Thanksgiving.

156
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,671
What can I talk to Dr. Burke about?

157
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:36,613
People who are shocked when
I show up uninvited call me Preston.

158
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,879
- Nobody calls you Preston.
- You don't call me Preston.

159
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,245
- Nice house.
- Yeah.

160
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,313
Izzie, why is it so quiet in here?

161
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:48,918
Meredith went to the hospital and
George is off shooting with his family.

162
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,486
So it's just me, you and Preston?

163
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,862
- And Alex. When he shows up.
- Oh, great!

164
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:57,334
Hey, Alex? It's me.
Where are you? OK, call me back.

165
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,932
- Is something burning?
- Oh! God, yes!

166
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,074
- Hey, Chief!
- I'm on my way home.

167
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:08,636
Yeah, me too. I was supposed
to meet Addison 20 minutes ago.

168
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,843
Dr. Shepherd. You're leaving?

169
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,886
- I'm also going home.
- Then go home.

170
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,854
Adele's sister's in town.
I hate that woman.

171
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,153
The OR Board needs
to be checked one more time.

172
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,819
It does, doesn't it? Excuse me.

173
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,660
I didn't think you'd be here today.

174
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,326
Yeah, well, I need a neuro consult.

175
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,768
Holden McKee. PVS 16 years.

176
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,499
There's no bleed,
there's no mass, no fracture.

177
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,337
He can be discharged.

178
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,235
Well, he opened his eyes
when I was examining him.

179
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,305
- He opened his eyes.
- Certain reflexes are preserved.

180
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,408
- There's arousal but no awareness.
- He was looking at me.

181
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,350
- He wasn't looking at you.
- He was.

182
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,979
The CT report says he wasn't.

183
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,422
- Do you want to argue with what I saw?
- No.

184
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:55,619
I don't want to argue with you anymore.
I gotta go, I'm late.

185
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:00,758
He was looking at you?

186
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,698
So, how are you?

187
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,328
I'm fine. How are you?

188
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,969
- Fine.
- Good.

189
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,845
Me and you are in this weird limbo.

190
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,939
This is gonna go on forever, isn't it?

191
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,211
I hope not, but I think so.

192
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,877
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah.

193
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:29,084
I moved Holden to a room on 4, so...

194
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,320
- You lead, I'll follow.
- OK.

195
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,260
Sixty-five GTO.

196
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:41,773
Fifty-seven Bel Air convertible.
Two door.

197
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,338
The GT 500. That was a car.

198
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:48,403
- It was.
- Georgie! Pick a car. Come on!

199
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,941
You do realize that you can buy a turkey
at the market.

200
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,716
They got hundreds of them. You know,
all wrapped. They're ready to go.

201
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,484
No ammo required.

202
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:01,117
You'll shoot the turkey today,
I can feel it.

203
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,923
That's the thing.
I don't want to shoot the turkey.

204
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,964
You say that every year.

205
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:10,295
Well, and every year
I don't shoot the turkey.

206
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,268
- What is that?
- It was supposed to be my marinade.

207
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,505
Alex? It's me, again.
Just wondering where you're at?

208
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,908
You've never made
a Thanksgiving dinner before.

209
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,474
You can't cook? Izzie.

210
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:30,386
Well, I'm a baker. I bake. I've seen
my grandmother cook a million times.

211
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,287
If there's no food, I'm going home.

212
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,088
Cristina. I have this.
What is your reference text?

213
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:38,358
<i>The Joy of Cooking.</i> I also printed
some recipes from the Internet

214
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,092
but they contradict one another.

215
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,693
I can't figure out which side is the top
and which is the bottom.

216
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:47,900
OK. OK.

217
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,472
Um...

218
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:57,141
I'm going to need a basting brush,
a bowl, a clove of garlic, and...

219
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,242
- Do you have any fennel?
- Um... Yeah, right here.

220
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,953
OK. Well, let's get this turkey
up and running, Stevens.

221
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,221
- Garlic.
- Garlic.

222
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,931
I'm going to need liquor.
Lots and lots of liquor.

223
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,562
There's no sustained visual pursuit.

224
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:22,499
You might have just seen him respond
to some sort of external stimuli.

225
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,673
He wasn't looking at you, I'm sorry.

226
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,874
I was sure he was.
Look, he just did it again.

227
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,783
Mr. McKee. Can you follow the light?

228
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,581
Can you hold up two fingers?

229
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:46,593
OK, well, I know
you're late for something, so...

230
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,656
- Keep talking.
- What?

231
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,965
Walk over here.
Just keep walking. Talk.

232
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,870
Holden? Holden?

233
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,967
Holden, can you hear me?

234
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,307
Holden?

235
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:03,405
It's you he's tracking,
he was following your voice.

236
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:12,815
Well, that's why there's no mention
of brain atrophy in the CT report.

237
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:17,420
- Because there isn't any.
- None? He's been PVS for 16 years.

238
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:20,727
Well, he's not PVS.
He's minimally conscious.

239
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,961
He's minimally conscious
and no one noticed?

240
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:26,994
Even in a state-of-the-art neural
facility they'd have tested him but...

241
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:30,371
- The regular nursing home just...
- Missed it.

242
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:35,812
He's been frozen, sleeping,
for 16 years, and they missed it.

243
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,482
That sucks.

244
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,216
There's one thing to be thankful for.

245
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,622
- What?
- We might be able to wake him up.

246
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:50,822
<i>Alex? It's Izzie. If you're not coming,</i>
<i>you could at least call and tell me.</i>

247
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,297
- I'm in hell.
- <i> I'm the one in hell.</i>

248
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,931
Burke's going all Iron Chef.
Get your ass back here and save me.

249
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,305
I'm in the woods.
With shotguns and car talk.

250
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,571
- It's like <i>Deliverance.</i>
- Let's break!

251
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:09,045
- One-two-three chug!
- <i>At least you have liquor.</i>

252
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:13,312
- Where does Meredith keep the booze?
- I don't think she has any.

253
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:16,843
How is that possible? She's a WASP.
Liquor is like oxygen to a WASP.

254
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:20,050
Which is why we're out of liquor.
Can you come and get me?

255
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,686
OK, how am I supposed to get through
the holidays without liquor?

256
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:25,753
Just come and get me.

257
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:27,988
Hell... Cristi...

258
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,627
"You can't handle the truth!"

259
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,727
Selfish!

260
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,829
Derek, it's me.

261
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,764
Where are you?

262
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,350
- Which one do you think she is?
- Holden's wife?

263
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,509
Yeah.

264
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,478
It's her.

265
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,248
How do you know?

266
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,120
Mrs. McKee?

267
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,428
It's Mrs. Leonard now.

268
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,494
What do you mean "wake him up"?

269
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,701
Over the years your husband's brain
has been slowly trying to heal itself.

270
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,266
And we've given him
a course of amphetamine

271
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,404
that should give his brain
a push toward consciousness.

272
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,915
When? How long does it take?

273
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:21,214
If we're right, your father
will be awake in a few hours.

274
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,448
Is he going to realize what happened?

275
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:27,720
Most patients in this situation have
no idea how much time has passed.

276
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,523
- Oh, my God.
- I'm going to be sick.

277
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,997
- I know it's a difficult situation...
- I just got married.

278
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:38,032
We're having a baby in December
and Coby turned 17 on Thursday.

279
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:43,270
- Difficult? This is unimaginable.
- Perhaps you should sit...

280
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:47,073
I can't be here when he wakes up.
He can't see me like this. Or Coby.

281
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:50,809
Coby, baby, we're leaving.
We'll be in the car.

282
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,180
Mrs. Leonard.

283
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,482
Holden is going to wake up
and find out we didn't wait for him.

284
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:59,115
He's a good person.
How could you do this to him?

285
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,396
You should get her back.

286
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,365
I'll try, but I don't know.

287
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,459
Took her a long time to move on.

288
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,404
We did the right thing.

289
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,532
Medically, Holden's our patient
and we treated him.

290
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,508
I'm sure he'll thank us later.

291
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,102
Meredith, it's...

292
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,273
Did you see that kid's face?

293
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,681
Holden is a complete stranger to him.

294
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:29,585
- Cases like this are...
- It's not cases like this.

295
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,646
It's this one case.

296
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,256
You don't get it.

297
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,393
You have a life.

298
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:44,334
You go to sleep, you wake up
and that life doesn't exist anymore?

299
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,764
That man has no one.

300
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,608
Everyone's moved on.

301
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,941
Except for him.

302
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,454
It's not an easy thing.

303
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,022
I'm sorry.

304
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,227
I know.

305
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,735
What are you doing up here?
Go to the pit. We're backed up.

306
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:22,365
No can do, sir.
The Nazi has me on this surgery.

307
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,602
We've got a line out the door
for sutures.

308
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:27,543
Everybody's an amateur chef
until they use a knife.

309
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,103
Knives can be tricky.

310
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:34,142
Your wife know you're working today?

311
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:37,120
I'm going home.
I just wanted to watch a bit.

312
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,214
Well, don't stay here too long.

313
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,886
You could end up like him.
Wife stabbed him.

314
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,794
Said she didn't like the way
he was carving the turkey.

315
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,388
Ouch.

316
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:52,462
- Happy Thanksgiving!
- Joe! Thank God.

317
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:55,405
Hey, this is my boyfriend, Walter.

318
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,841
- Whatever. Tell me you brought liquor.
- I brought pie. Pumpkin.

319
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,012
You're a bartender.

320
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,639
Did you bring scalpels?

321
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:13,958
- Come on. Pick a car.
- I don't want to pick a car.

322
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:17,689
- He doesn't know jack about cars.
- I do. I just don't want to pick one.

323
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,823
Georgie's tired. They working you
too hard at the hospital?

324
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,299
You know, he works 48-hour shifts.

325
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:26,098
- 48 hours and you enjoy it?
- Yeah, I enjoy it.

326
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:29,197
- Like, what do you do?
- You know, medical stuff.

327
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,299
- Come on.
- They're not going to get it.

328
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:35,506
Make your brothers jealous. Tell them
what it's like to be a big-time surgeon.

329
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:36,912
Come on!

330
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,944
OK. Last night, this was pretty cool.

331
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,852
- I assisted on a truncal vagotomy and...
- Assisted?

332
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:47,858
- Well, what do you mean?
- I helped a surgeon.

333
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:51,259
- Anyway, we inflated...
- Wait, I thought you were the surgeon.

334
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,630
I'm a surgical intern. The resident or
the attending, they perform the surgery.

335
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:59,967
So you don't actually cut anybody open.
I mean, by yourself?

336
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,302
No.

337
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:06,469
Do you hand the surgeon
stuff that he needs?

338
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,843
Scalpels?

339
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,472
That's a scrub nurse.

340
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:14,246
Georgie does that thing with
the gas that puts the patient to sleep.

341
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,547
That's an anesthesiologist.

342
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,714
Do you like take the patient to surgery?

343
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,518
Um... orderly.

344
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,023
No, like, the point of being an intern
is that you're learning.

345
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:27,122
We watch the surgeries.
The attending asks us questions.

346
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,463
And we have to answer them.
It's not easy.

347
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:34,029
I have to be on top of my game 100%%
of the time. It's incredibly difficult.

348
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,166
So you don't actually do anything.

349
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,037
- Yes, I do.
- You just stand there.

350
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,343
- I assist...
- Watching the real doctors.

351
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:46,851
- I am a real doctor! Dad!
- You said you don't do anything.

352
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,285
No, I didn't!
You said I didn't do anything.

353
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,619
Real doctors save lives.
If you're just standing there...

354
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,124
Oh, for God...

355
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,990
What?

356
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,529
I want to go home.

357
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,296
Just as soon as you shoot your turkey.

358
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:12,633
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for my patient to wake.

359
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,702
Why aren't you at the Thanksgiving?

360
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,873
Why aren't you at Thanksgiving?

361
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,954
What?

362
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,965
I tell you something,
you tell me something.

363
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,731
OK.

364
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:46,244
I feel like one of those people
who's so freaking miserable

365
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:49,212
they can't be around normal people.

366
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,715
Like I'll infect the happy people.

367
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:57,153
Like I'm some miserable, diseased,
dirty ex-mistress.

368
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,082
Your turn.

369
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,959
I failed the medical boards.

370
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,831
If I tell Izzie, she'll be nice
about it, all supportive and optimistic.

371
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:15,136
She might as well rip my nads off
and turn 'em into earrings.

372
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,801
Alex, you should go to Thanksgiving.

373
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,310
I mean, don't tell her
if you don't want to.

374
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,043
But you should go.

375
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:27,882
Otherwise you're just... me.

376
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,150
A miserable, diseased,
dirty ex-mistress?

377
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:35,023
That's hot. That's really hot.

378
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,789
- I feel better already.
- See?

379
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,062
Happy Thanksgiving.

380
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:56,113
Hello? Is somebody there?

381
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,977
Somebody?

382
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:05,990
Yes. Somebody's here.

383
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,394
Your muscles have suffered deterioration

384
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:15,592
and your joints will be painful,
which is to be expected.

385
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:19,626
The fact that your communication skills
are still intact is remarkable.

386
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:22,435
Did you reach my wife yet?

387
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:28,405
I mean, is she coming?
I mean, have you told her

388
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,416
or do you wait until she gets here?

389
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:36,818
Because this is going to be
quite a shock.

390
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:38,981
How long have I been out?

391
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,588
- A year?
- Would you excuse us?

392
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,290
Yes, doctor.

393
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,925
No, you tell me. Please.

394
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,869
You found me. You tell me.

395
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:57,204
I'm only an intern.
I've never really done this before.

396
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,266
Me either.

397
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,671
You'll do it quickly.

398
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,545
Rip off the bandage.

399
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:09,416
Mm. No anesthesia.

400
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,248
Exactly.

401
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:15,885
Mm.
I'll be right outside if you need me.

402
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:28,903
Truth time.

403
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,871
Truth time.

404
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:38,243
How bad is this truth gonna be?

405
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,784
It's bad, Holden.

406
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,996
You have to cut the celery
into finer pieces, Stevens.

407
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:02,062
Like that?

408
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,268
- It'll do. Put them in with the onions.
- OK.

409
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,745
Now, what should you be
concerned about?

410
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:10,907
Um...

411
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,746
The turkey, Stevens.
I expect you to know that.

412
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,446
Right. I need to check the turkey

413
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,216
to make sure it's cooking
at the correct temperature.

414
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,191
- And how do we do that?
- Meat thermometer.

415
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,420
Ten bucks says she dries out the turkey.

416
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,362
- 20 says she pulls it off.
- 75 says I don't care.

417
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:29,226
OK, Stevens.
Let's see what you can do.

418
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,500
All right. More pressure.

419
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,767
Turkey has a tough shell. Dig in.

420
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,934
- I'm in.
- Damn. She got it in.

421
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,307
- Told you she'll pull it off.
- Not bad.

422
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:43,836
All you have to do now is get the
thermometer deep enough in the bird.

423
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:45,610
- But be careful not to...
- Oh!

424
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,117
You hit the bone.

425
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:51,053
The pan is filling with juice and you're
losing moisture. What do you do?

426
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,750
- Think!
- That's it. I'm out of here.

427
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:59,656
- What's the problem?
- You're operating on a turkey.

428
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:04,191
And... And you're making friends
with my friends.

429
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,396
Shh. You told me to be nice.

430
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:09,369
It will be nice.

431
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,171
I'm just going to go to the store
and get some liquor.

432
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,235
Can I have the keys, please?

433
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:16,937
I'll be back.

434
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:25,520
- Dr. Burke!
- Suction! Use the baster and suction!

435
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:30,527
The GT 500 was a Shelby.
He also made the Viper, you know that?

436
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:33,655
- Yes. We do know.
- Shelby 500. A good car.

437
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,597
Yeah.

438
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,192
- And the other car he made is...
- Turkey.

439
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,767
Turkey.

440
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:47,039
Jerry. We came out here
so I could shoot a turkey.

441
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,774
Dad said we're not leaving
until I shoot a turkey.

442
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,839
I am shooting this turkey.

443
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:58,652
When you're sure
you've got it, squeeze.

444
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,088
No fair. I called turkey.

445
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,456
Don't worry, he's going to chicken out.

446
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,453
Yahoo!

447
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,929
- You got it!
- I got it?

448
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,829
You got it, Georgie!

449
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,699
Let's go home!

450
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:15,138
What's he like? My son.

451
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:18,698
You know, I didn't really get
a chance to speak with him.

452
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:21,211
But he seemed nice.

453
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,545
He's tall like you.
And he's got your eyes.

454
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,482
That...

455
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,986
That's good.

456
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:37,193
- Holden, we're ready to begin.
- What does the MRI do?

457
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,356
Just gives us a better picture
of your brain, really.

458
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,593
You're one for the books, you know.

459
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,259
That's nice.

460
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:46,125
If you're ready.

461
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:47,933
When I went down into that fire...

462
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,474
we were going on vacation the next day.

463
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:53,136
Taking the baby to see my mom.

464
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:54,701
She was so excited.

465
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,772
I tried to call my mom today.

466
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,711
But, um...

467
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,713
She's dead now.

468
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:11,526
My mother's been dead for eight years.

469
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,326
I'm ready.

470
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:20,962
OK.

471
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:32,181
- How's he doing?
- As well as we could expect.

472
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,186
Damn it.

473
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:47,163
An epidural hematoma.

474
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:50,793
When you fell out of your bed
this morning, you hit your temple. Hard.

475
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:53,497
The CT didn't catch it, but the MRI did.

476
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,570
- And you can fix it?
- Won't be easy.

477
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:01,669
Sometimes it's impossible to find
the vessel and complications can arise,

478
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:04,237
but, yes, I can operate.

479
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,545
Well, so there is a risk?

480
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,552
Very large risk, yes.

481
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,986
And what happens if you don't operate?

482
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:14,355
The best-case scenario
is that the bleeding resolves itself.

483
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:18,362
Or it can continue to bleed
and cause the brain to swell.

484
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,988
Which means what?

485
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:23,694
Most likely,
without the operation, you'll die.

486
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,532
But the operation could kill me, too.
Right?

487
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:30,096
There are equal risks both ways.

488
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,508
What do I do?

489
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,747
What would you do?

490
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,015
I can't answer this for you.

491
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,424
Can I have that spatula, please?

492
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:55,656
Thank you.

493
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,031
You want the butter to melt,
not to boil.

494
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,468
Dr. Burke, how did you
learn to cook like this?

495
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:09,172
My mother owns a restaurant in Alabama.

496
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,238
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

497
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:14,314
Does Cristina know that?

498
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:16,615
No. Actually, she doesn't.

499
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:20,256
She doesn't ask
a lot of personal questions.

500
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:24,125
- She's kind of hard to get to know.
- Yes. She is.

501
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:31,829
- Karev didn't show?
- No. He didn't.

502
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:35,570
Is that OK?

503
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,404
No. It's not.

504
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:41,536
Do you know that there's
absolutely no liquor in this house?

505
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:46,380
- Yeah, Cristina went to get some.
- Over an hour ago. Where is she?

506
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,079
Dr. Yang?

507
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,817
Um... Yes?

508
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:55,459
Have you seen my husband?

509
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,051
No, I have not.

510
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,561
Do you know where he is?

511
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,253
No, I do not.

512
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:03,698
He was supposed to meet me hours ago.

513
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:18,875
- I'm not here.
- Neither am I.

514
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,044
<i></i>
<i>Any available IV nurse to the ER.</i>

515
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:28,250
- Levi Johnson!
- Yes.

516
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,658
- You swallowed a wishbone?
- Yes.

517
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,992
Excellent.
We'll have to take some films.

518
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:36,158
Maybe you ruptured your esophagus.
That means surgery.

519
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,362
I don't believe this.

520
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,238
Car's loaded! Guys! Coolers, come on.

521
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,141
Get up.

522
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,704
Dad! Come on.

523
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:54,684
Hold on, Georgie. We got to blood you.

524
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,811
Oh, no.

525
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,482
Now there you go.

526
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:03,015
Now you're officially an O'Malley man.

527
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:05,858
O'Malley!

528
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,659
I left my hat.

529
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,324
O'Malley!

530
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,062
Guys! Get in... Just get in the car.

531
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:15,037
- O'Malley!
- Twenty-one gun salute for Georgie!

532
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:18,303
That's not the best idea, guys.
I'm serious. Don't!

533
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,809
Ow!

534
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:25,373
You shot Dad in the ass!
Are you happy now?

535
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:31,888
It's like laser tag.

536
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:35,187
- Not in the eyes.
- Guys! This is the trauma room.

537
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,727
What are you doing?

538
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,762
Put it down.

539
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,095
Dad, I'm going to inject you
to numb the area.

540
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:47,194
I'm fine. I don't need anything.
It doesn't even hurt that bad.

541
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:51,140
Dad. You have birdshot
embedded in your gluteus maximus.

542
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:54,576
When I start removing it, believe me,
it's going to hurt very bad.

543
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:57,274
Hey, '65 GTO.

544
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:59,248
That's a V8 tweaker.

545
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,478
You don't want that.
You want the Bel Air.

546
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:04,646
- But it's gotta be the two-tone. Right?
- Nice.

547
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:07,088
- Pick a car, Georgie.
- No, thanks.

548
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:08,682
Come on, pick a car.

549
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,457
He doesn't know jack about
cars. He doesn't know jack about jack.

550
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:16,091
Jerry, first you say the GTO.

551
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,798
Ronny counters with the Bel Air, which
never fails to make Dad say the GT 500.

552
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:23,238
The Cobra, the Chieftan,
then a German car,

553
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:26,209
which then starts
the American-versus-foreign debate

554
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,768
that ends when one of you
brings up the DeVille.

555
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:32,407
And that always, always leads
to the unbelievably long discussion

556
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:34,781
on the merits of the '57 Thunderbird.

557
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:37,980
So how about I jump to the end
and name the Thunderbird now

558
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:42,925
so once in our lives we can stop
picking cars! And my name is George!

559
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,395
What do you know. The kid came back.

560
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,459
No, he didn't.

561
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,273
He says we have the same eyes.

562
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:03,939
Yeah.

563
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,744
I don't see it.

564
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:21,330
He said that he couldn't stay.

565
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:23,458
Because of the holiday.

566
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:28,028
But he said he'll come back
some time soon.

567
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,006
Good.

568
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,803
Yeah.

569
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,768
He said she's happy.

570
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:40,841
That this guy, Hal,
is really good for her.

571
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,786
She loves him.

572
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:51,922
So I've decided to
go ahead with the surgery.

573
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:57,394
They've moved on. I should too.

574
00:33:57,468 --> 00:34:01,268
Now get this thing out of my head

575
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:06,003
and let me get on with my life.

576
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,637
Right.

577
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,911
I'll tell Dr. Shepherd.

578
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:21,149
- Dr. Grey.
- Yeah?

579
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:26,555
Do you think he really will come back?

580
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,231
I hope so.

581
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:37,005
Joe and Walter have got the table set up
in the living room. How's our bird?

582
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,066
He needs a few more hours.

583
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,646
Why did you plan this big dinner
if you knew you couldn't cook?

584
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:49,208
I just like Thanksgiving, Dr. Burke.

585
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:52,219
Preston.

586
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,451
You just like Thanksgiving?

587
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:59,192
Doctor-patient confidentiality?

588
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,130
- Doctor-patient confidentiality.
- OK.

589
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:09,502
We work 18 hours a day, six days a week,
50 weeks a year.

590
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:14,604
We don't really have any time
for our families.

591
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,647
We don't have friends
that aren't doctors.

592
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:22,152
But we have this one day
where we don't have to cut anyone open.

593
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:25,420
One day where we get to be
like everybody else.

594
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,685
One day to be normal.

595
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:35,327
A day where nobody lives
and nobody dies on our watch.

596
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,698
It's like a gift.

597
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:42,865
So I just thought
we should appreciate it, that's all.

598
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,965
I gotta set the table.

599
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,476
A day without surgery.

600
00:35:57,188 --> 00:36:00,021
Who swallows a wishbone whole?

601
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,354
Dr. Bailey,
why are you working on Thanksgiving?

602
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,861
You work the extra shifts
and get the extra practice.

603
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:13,370
I'm trying to get in
all the practice I can...

604
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,941
before the baby comes
and I have to take time off.

605
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:24,842
My husband isn't thrilled
I'm working Thanksgiving,

606
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:29,683
but he isn't a surgeon
so he doesn't get it.

607
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,813
Oh.

608
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:37,092
You and Dr. Burke?

609
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,619
Yeah.

610
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:46,362
He would have made a good father.

611
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:50,504
They said the Nazi was in here.

612
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,703
He was, but he left.
I think he went down to the pit.

613
00:36:58,449 --> 00:36:59,473
Don't ask.

614
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:16,455
Hey.

615
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,503
- You coming?
- Not enough interns.

616
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,698
I got to cover the floor.

617
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:29,071
What would you have done if you
were him? Would you have the surgery?

618
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,313
You would have the surgery.

619
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,010
I would want the future.

620
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,680
Or to be asleep again.
One or the other.

621
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,053
Nothing in between.

622
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:42,684
I honestly don't know what I'd want.

623
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,293
I know you don't.

624
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:51,859
If you get a chance,
you can scrub in later.

625
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,927
I'm going to be at this a while.

626
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:05,414
- Thought you'd forgotten about me.
- No. Where are Ronny and Jerry?

627
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:08,077
A nurse told them
that the cafeteria was open.

628
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,144
Oh.

629
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:20,464
- You didn't have fun today.
- It's not that...

630
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,323
No.

631
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,894
No, I didn't have fun.

632
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:33,005
- You hurt your brothers' feelings.
- Dad!

633
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,545
- You did.
- They talk to me like I'm stupid.

634
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:41,176
They call me Georgie. They've never
treated me like I'm one of them.

635
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:44,278
George, Jerry is a dry cleaner,

636
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:48,223
Ronny works in a post office,
I drive a truck.

637
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,920
You're a surgeon. You're not one of us.

638
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,986
I know it. And they know it.

639
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:56,393
You make sure we know it.

640
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,966
- Dad...
- I'm not blaming you.

641
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:04,667
It makes me proud you're so smart.
Like I did something right.

642
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:10,303
It's just...

643
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:13,216
We try.

644
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,376
We try to include you.

645
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:19,150
But you don't like the stuff
that we like

646
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:22,522
and we don't know how to talk about
the stuff you wanna talk about.

647
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,356
You're not one of us.

648
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:27,124
But damn it,
we don't treat you like you're stupid.

649
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,393
You treat us like we're stupid.

650
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:35,861
And maybe we are, but we're your family.

651
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:40,041
Give us an inch, Georgie.

652
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:44,070
Every once in a while, pick a car.

653
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:55,489
I saved a guy's life
on an elevator last month.

654
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:00,858
I performed open-heart surgery
on him right there.

655
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,556
By yourself?

656
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,097
By myself.

657
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:09,196
Just like a real doctor.

658
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:14,835
Hm! That's something.

659
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:19,305
That's really something.

660
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:07,654
I'll take care of it.

661
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,399
What are you doing here?

662
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:26,079
Oh. This is beyond bad.

663
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:36,251
Sorry, Izzie, it's after eight.
Got to get to the bar.

664
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,955
- On Thanksgiving?
- It's one of our busiest days.

665
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:43,022
People need a haven from the bitterness,
Ioneliness, quality family time.

666
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,432
I'm their port in the storm.
See you later?

667
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,902
- Yeah.
- OK. Night, doc.

668
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,906
- Night, Joe.
- Bye, Walter, thanks for coming.

669
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:56,569
You can leave too if you want.

670
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:59,309
I'm not leaving the table
until the hostess does.

671
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:01,817
- They're not coming.
- Even so.

672
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:16,857
Today I committed bird murder
and I was forced to touch my Dad's ass.

673
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:19,494
I get extra points
for showing up at all.

674
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,730
I brought booze.

675
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,952
Let's just eat.

676
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:51,658
You know today in the waiting room.

677
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,203
How did you know Cheryl
was Holden's wife?

678
00:42:56,674 --> 00:43:00,633
Waiting rooms are full of people
hoping for good news.

679
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:04,670
She was the only one who looked like
she'd completely given up.

680
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,012
Yeah.

681
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,077
Do you love her?

682
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,427
I don't know.

683
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:34,470
It's good that you're trying.

684
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:37,275
You wouldn't be you
if you weren't the kind of person

685
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:39,748
who's trying to make it work.

686
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,978
- You think so?
- Yeah.

687
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:47,686
It means I wasn't wrong about you.

688
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:50,316
Thanks.

689
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:02,869
Goodbye, Derek.

690
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,869
Bye, Meredith.

691
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,349
<i>Maybe we're not supposed to be happy.</i>

692
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:20,050
<i>Maybe gratitude...</i>
<i>has nothing to do with joy.</i>

693
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:22,614
Hey!

694
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:25,191
Hey.

695
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:27,253
You going inside?

696
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,697
- No. You go ahead.
- You sure?

697
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:33,362
Yeah. Go make her happy.

698
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:35,405
Yeah.

699
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:41,172
<i>Maybe being grateful means recognizing</i>
<i>what you have for what it is.</i>

700
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:44,507
Hi.

701
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:47,015
You're a surgical junkie. Go home.

702
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:50,645
Adele's already mad.
I'm in trouble no matter what.

703
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:53,854
And there's a Whipple happening
in OR two.

704
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:56,119
Go home right now!

705
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:01,324
This kind of treatment
is why they call you the Nazi.

706
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:06,028
- <i>Appreciating small victories.</i>
- Happy Thanksgiving.

707
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:12,565
I was nice.

708
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:16,741
Yeah. I noticed.

709
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:20,573
You don't ask
a lot of personal questions.

710
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:23,851
And you're very hard to get to know.

711
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,183
Yes.

712
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:32,694
My mother owns a restaurant in Alabama.

713
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:38,267
I scrubbed in on a foreign body removal
this afternoon.

714
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:41,304
A guy swallowed a wishbone whole.

715
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:49,043
<i>Admiring the struggle it takes</i>
<i>simply to be human.</i>

716
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:02,615
You didn't show.

717
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:06,622
So, um...

718
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:10,725
I bought Chinese food.

719
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:15,137
And I waited.

720
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:17,563
It was good.

721
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:22,074
Now it's lukewarm and old.

722
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:25,377
Which makes it just like the food
we used to have in medical school.

723
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,643
So...

724
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,079
Derek, are you done?

725
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:35,751
Hurting me back, I mean.

726
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:38,158
Because I need to know,
because if not...

727
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,965
I gotta special order a thicker skin.

728
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:44,728
Or something.

729
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:52,767
<i>Maybe we're thankful</i>
<i>for the familiar things we know.</i>

730
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:58,913
No anesthesia in sight.

731
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:03,347
Here we go.

732
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:07,254
<i>And maybe we're thankful</i>
<i>for the things we'll never know.</i>

733
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:13,886
Is this seat taken?

734
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:20,194
- Do you work at the hospital?
- No.

735
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:24,229
You're not a brain surgeon
or a doctor of any kind?

736
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,037
No.

737
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,645
Then this seat isn't taken.

738
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:38,944
<i>At the end of the day, the fact that we</i>
<i>have the courage to still be standing...</i>

739
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,047
Do you wanna buy me a drink?

740
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:44,650
Actually, I do.

741
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:47,390
<i>... is reason enough to celebrate.</i>
