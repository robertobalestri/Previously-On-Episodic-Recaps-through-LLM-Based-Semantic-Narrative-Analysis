00:00:01,508 --> 00:00:03,703
<i>Previously on Grey's Anatomy:</i>

2
00:00:03,777 --> 00:00:06,473
I slept with George.
It was a horrible mistake.

3
00:00:06,547 --> 00:00:08,606
I'm done. We're done.

4
00:00:08,682 --> 00:00:10,377
- Pancakes?
- He's not my roommate.

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,111
I shouldn't have given up my place.

6
00:00:12,185 --> 00:00:14,676
He'd still be our roommate
if Meredith apologized.

7
00:00:14,755 --> 00:00:18,384
You know, at some point
you are going to have to talk to me.

8
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:20,688
Your ex did a real number on you, huh?

9
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:23,696
- You didn't call me.
- I did, I did. A few times.

10
00:00:23,764 --> 00:00:25,629
I just hung up every time.

11
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:28,031
- How is she today?
- She's great.

12
00:00:28,101 --> 00:00:30,934
She really lights up
when Dr. Webber visits.

13
00:00:33,373 --> 00:00:37,173
Denny, you're congestive heart failure
is getting worse despite the meds.

14
00:00:37,244 --> 00:00:38,677
We need more time.

15
00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:47,547
<i>My college campus has a magic statue.</i>

16
00:00:49,623 --> 00:00:54,287
<i>It's a long-standing tradition for
students to rub its nose for good luck.</i>

17
00:00:57,931 --> 00:01:01,526
<i>My freshman roommate
really believed in the statue's power</i>

18
00:01:01,602 --> 00:01:06,301
<i>and insisted on visiting it
to rub its nose before every exam.</i>

19
00:01:11,578 --> 00:01:14,741
Are you sure my scrub caps
weren't in laundry delivery?

20
00:01:14,815 --> 00:01:15,907
I triple-checked.

21
00:01:15,983 --> 00:01:17,678
- You're sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

22
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:20,117
<i>Studying might have been a better idea.</i>

23
00:01:20,187 --> 00:01:22,382
<i>She flunked out her sophomore year.</i>

24
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:28,792
<i>But the fact is we all have
little superstitious things that we do.</i>

25
00:01:30,998 --> 00:01:35,128
All right. It's a beautiful morning
to save lives. Let's have some fun.

26
00:01:35,202 --> 00:01:37,397
<i>If it's not believing in magic statues,</i>

27
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:42,704
<i>it's avoiding sidewalk cracks, or always
putting our left shoe on first.</i>

28
00:01:44,811 --> 00:01:46,642
OK.

29
00:01:46,713 --> 00:01:47,873
<i>Knock on wood.</i>

30
00:01:47,948 --> 00:01:49,438
Ten blade.

31
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,342
<i>Step on a crack,
break your mother's back.</i>

32
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:56,879
Paddles.

33
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,926
Ten joules.

34
00:02:01,194 --> 00:02:04,493
- I have to take him off.
- I'm in the middle of his brain.

35
00:02:04,564 --> 00:02:06,862
We're losing him.

36
00:02:16,877 --> 00:02:18,071
Time of death...

37
00:02:18,145 --> 00:02:19,271
Time of death...

38
00:02:19,346 --> 00:02:20,608
Time of death...

39
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:21,670
Call it, Grey.

40
00:02:21,748 --> 00:02:24,444
<i>The last thing we want to do
is offend the gods.</i>

41
00:02:24,518 --> 00:02:26,509
Time of death 8:17.

42
00:02:31,725 --> 00:02:34,990
Four surgeries, four fatalities
and the day has barely started.

43
00:02:35,062 --> 00:02:36,620
- Can I have a bite of that?
- No.

44
00:02:36,697 --> 00:02:40,531
- You're in my apartment, not my food.
- Dr. Burke gave me a protein bar.

45
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,591
Burke packs his lunch for him.
Did I mention?

46
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:45,297
- I talked to the morgue guy.
- The one with the unibrow?

47
00:02:45,372 --> 00:02:47,431
The one with the teeth thing.

48
00:02:47,507 --> 00:02:50,203
He said surgical fatalities
come in threes and sevens.

49
00:02:50,277 --> 00:02:51,938
There'll be three more today.

50
00:02:52,012 --> 00:02:54,879
OK then.
Since "dead tooth" morgue guy said so.

51
00:02:54,948 --> 00:02:59,009
He's the morgue guy.
He knows things about death.

52
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:00,883
You dropped this.

53
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:06,788
- He's ignoring me.
- Ignore him back.

54
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,852
Derek says I should apologize
until he listens.

55
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,659
- Derek says?
- It's good advice.

56
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:14,223
He's my friend.
That's good friend advice.

57
00:03:14,768 --> 00:03:16,565
- Hey.
- Meredith...

58
00:03:16,636 --> 00:03:17,625
What?

59
00:03:17,704 --> 00:03:22,698
- Did you sneak out last night?
- Yeah. I, um... I couldn't sleep.

60
00:03:22,776 --> 00:03:24,676
- Come on.
- Where?

61
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:26,144
- ER.
- All of us?

62
00:03:26,213 --> 00:03:29,705
We've all had deaths.
Let's all go save a life.

63
00:03:34,821 --> 00:03:36,812
Uh, Dr. Bailey.

64
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:39,491
- Here you go.
- What's this?

65
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:41,959
Hot cocoa.
It's a little ritual we had in New York.

66
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:45,327
Four surgeries, four deaths,
we could all use a little good juju.

67
00:03:45,398 --> 00:03:48,026
- And cocoa equals juju how?
- Hey, hey, hey.

68
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:50,092
Don't question the cocoa.

69
00:03:51,138 --> 00:03:52,765
Carry on.

70
00:03:53,774 --> 00:03:58,404
Meredith.
Thank you for your help this morning.

71
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:00,912
Oh. Thank you, Addison.

72
00:04:02,482 --> 00:04:04,575
Yeah. Thank you.

73
00:04:09,723 --> 00:04:11,623
- Here you go.
- Juju.

74
00:04:11,691 --> 00:04:13,022
Yep.

75
00:04:13,093 --> 00:04:15,186
- You jujued Meredith.
- I did.

76
00:04:15,262 --> 00:04:17,457
In the spirit of friendship.

77
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:22,262
- Hmm.
- Are we not friends with Meredith now?

78
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:24,735
No, no, we are.
Meredith and I are friends.

79
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:29,037
And you and I are married. So then,
by proxy, Meredith and I are friends.

80
00:04:29,109 --> 00:04:30,872
- That's very big of you.
- Yeah.

81
00:04:30,944 --> 00:04:32,571
You don't have to do that.

82
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:36,582
It's not like I'm going to be friends
with let's say, uh... Mark.

83
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,118
Yeah, well, neither am I.

84
00:04:39,186 --> 00:04:41,552
Now finish your juju
before somebody else dies.

85
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:43,316
Hmm.

86
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:54,023
There are ten.
Music notes. Colorful patterns.

87
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,068
They were sent out last night.

88
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,166
- Sorry about your valve replacement.
- The laundry misplaced my scrub caps.

89
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:05,007
There's some foolish talk about
fatality clusters in threes and sevens.

90
00:05:05,078 --> 00:05:07,774
Are you sure they weren't sent
to another hospital?

91
00:05:07,848 --> 00:05:10,180
How many electives
have they canceled today?

92
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,444
This is our third.

93
00:05:11,518 --> 00:05:13,679
And what have
the surgeons' reasons been?

94
00:05:13,753 --> 00:05:16,347
Because I prefer my own caps.

95
00:05:16,423 --> 00:05:19,688
You're not pushing surgeries
because you don't have your caps.

96
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,251
- You understand me?
- I didn't push any surgeries.

97
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,498
No, no. The question is:
When will you find them?

98
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:30,127
No one changes that board
unless they talk to me.

99
00:05:30,203 --> 00:05:32,433
No one.

100
00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:39,568
Great. No blood, no guts,
no lives to save. It's dead quiet.

101
00:05:39,646 --> 00:05:41,841
- Did you really say that?
- Cristina...

102
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:43,849
- What?
- You said the Q-word.

103
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:46,283
- It's like saying Macbeth in a theater.
- Please.

104
00:05:46,353 --> 00:05:48,787
You think because someone
says it's quiet...

105
00:05:48,855 --> 00:05:51,153
Can somebody help us?
She's coughing up blood.

106
00:05:51,224 --> 00:05:52,885
O'Malley!

107
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,586
- Denny Duquette.
- I got it.

108
00:05:54,661 --> 00:05:57,459
- He's my patient.
- He's both your patient. Answer it.

109
00:05:58,598 --> 00:06:00,566
Two incoming.

110
00:06:00,634 --> 00:06:02,625
There should be more under there.

111
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,336
OK, uh, Yang, first one's yours.
Grey, take number two.

112
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,310
Go.

113
00:06:16,383 --> 00:06:20,012
Jesse Fannon, 32, unrestrained driver
in a rear-end collision.

114
00:06:20,086 --> 00:06:22,384
Spider-webbing on the windshield
where his head hit.

115
00:06:22,455 --> 00:06:26,289
- BP's 120 palp. Pulse 75.
- Well, what do you want to do, Yang?

116
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:29,590
Primary and secondary survey.
Uh, head CT and X-ray.

117
00:06:29,663 --> 00:06:32,154
OK. Page Shepherd when you get there.

118
00:06:32,232 --> 00:06:36,566
Wait! I'm counting the siren whoops.
We can't go until it reaches 33.

119
00:06:36,636 --> 00:06:38,661
He also seems to have a touch of OCD.

120
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:43,540
Nikki Ratlin, 30, erratic BP
in the field. Chest and leg pain.

121
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,374
- What happened?
- I got struck by lightning.

122
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:50,040
Can anyone spell coincidence?

123
00:07:00,894 --> 00:07:03,624
My horoscope said,
"Stay close to home today. "

124
00:07:03,697 --> 00:07:05,858
Aries couldn't have been any clearer.

125
00:07:05,932 --> 00:07:08,400
OK, I guess it could have said,
"Don't leave the house today

126
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:11,403
unless you want to get
struck by lightning. " Ouch.

127
00:07:11,471 --> 00:07:14,736
Ms. Ratlin, you have no sign
of wounds from lightning.

128
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:16,275
It was a sign.

129
00:07:16,343 --> 00:07:19,471
Clearly getting struck by lightning
is a sign.

130
00:07:19,546 --> 00:07:21,480
That I shouldn't have left my house.

131
00:07:21,548 --> 00:07:24,073
Normally people struck by lightning
have a wound

132
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,641
where the bolt
entered and exited the body.

133
00:07:28,989 --> 00:07:32,550
Well... well, I wasn't struck struck.

134
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,923
The tree was struck and it fell on me.

135
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:38,119
A tree fell on you?

136
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:43,659
A big, like, branch or limb. Whatever.
Same difference.

137
00:07:44,404 --> 00:07:46,998
No, actually, medically,
it isn't the same difference.

138
00:07:47,073 --> 00:07:51,703
And it would be helpful if from now on
you told us the whole truth.

139
00:07:51,778 --> 00:07:53,871
You want to know the truth?

140
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:59,350
My boyfriend loves that tree.
He's totally going to freak out.

141
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:01,683
Ow.

142
00:08:01,755 --> 00:08:06,556
Chief? There's a Ms. Warner
down in Admitting. She's asking for you.

143
00:08:06,626 --> 00:08:09,322
- Who?
- Um, Olive Warner?

144
00:08:10,363 --> 00:08:13,025
Fifties. Uh, blonde hair.

145
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:15,932
She said she's known you
for about 20 years.

146
00:08:16,002 --> 00:08:17,663
Are you talking about Ollie?

147
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:19,864
Right. OK. Uh, Ollie Warner.

148
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:23,102
She presented with upper GI bleeding.

149
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:27,169
And she had a TIPSS procedure
last month for esophageal varices.

150
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:37,954
I'll take this from here, O'Malley.

151
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:39,719
Happy to help, sir.

152
00:08:39,793 --> 00:08:42,318
No, thank you. I got this myself.

153
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:48,928
Ollie.

154
00:08:49,002 --> 00:08:51,334
Hi, Richard. Good to see you.

155
00:08:55,842 --> 00:08:59,676
Sinus tachycardia,
low-grade fever, pulse ox 75.

156
00:09:01,548 --> 00:09:04,176
- I'm hearing rales in your lungs.
- Yeah.

157
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,878
A freight train rolls through at noon.

158
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:10,486
How bad is the pain?

159
00:09:10,557 --> 00:09:13,754
I don't know.
A five or six when I breathe.

160
00:09:13,827 --> 00:09:17,058
Which means a seven or eight when you're
not trying to impress your doctor.

161
00:09:19,132 --> 00:09:22,568
Heard, uh, four people died
in surgery this morning.

162
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:25,229
Said they were expecting three more.

163
00:09:25,305 --> 00:09:27,273
You get that from a nurse?

164
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,399
Never reveal my sources.

165
00:09:29,476 --> 00:09:31,842
Just like to avoid the OR.

166
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,050
And I'm not liking that look.

167
00:09:44,557 --> 00:09:46,991
This could be
a pulmonary embolism, Denny.

168
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,928
A complication from the LVAD surgery.
We have to talk to Dr. Burke.

169
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:06,371
I got hot chocolated.
The She-Shepherd hot chocolated me.

170
00:10:06,446 --> 00:10:09,472
- It's her juju.
- I don't like people who say juju.

171
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:12,950
- I say juju.
- Juju, juju, juju. Juju, juju, juju.

172
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,680
Juju, juju, juju.

173
00:10:14,754 --> 00:10:16,449
I didn't drink it.

174
00:10:16,523 --> 00:10:19,890
You're not obligated
to honor someone else's juju.

175
00:10:21,027 --> 00:10:23,791
- Thought you were being friends.
- I am. With him.

176
00:10:23,863 --> 00:10:26,058
Do I have to be friends with her too?

177
00:10:26,132 --> 00:10:27,394
Definitely not.

178
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:29,435
Maybe.

179
00:10:29,502 --> 00:10:31,333
Juju, juju, juju.

180
00:10:31,404 --> 00:10:34,498
- I'II, uh, call Psych for you.
- That'd be good. Thanks.

181
00:10:34,574 --> 00:10:36,337
Ow! Ow!

182
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:38,536
All right. That's the worst of it.

183
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:41,808
I never should have gotten out of bed.

184
00:10:43,082 --> 00:10:47,610
But I really wanted to surprise
my boyfriend before he left for school.

185
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:52,852
He had a huge exam today and I just,
you know, wanted to wish him luck.

186
00:10:52,926 --> 00:10:55,360
Dr. Torres. Hey. Hi.

187
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:57,089
Uh, can I give you a hand?

188
00:10:57,163 --> 00:10:59,358
You missed the boat, George.

189
00:10:59,432 --> 00:11:01,366
You mean on this case or?

190
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:04,301
Or... a hot chick gives you her number,
you're supposed to call.

191
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,598
Yeah.

192
00:11:05,672 --> 00:11:08,197
- I... I was... I mean, I am.
- Too late.

193
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:10,936
Ouch. Don't give up.

194
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,501
I mean, if you really like her.

195
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:19,180
Uh... OK.

196
00:11:23,756 --> 00:11:26,224
OK, the plot thickens.

197
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:29,318
Nikki, Dr. Grey here is going
to take you upstairs for a CT.

198
00:11:29,395 --> 00:11:31,727
But before she does, I have to ask:

199
00:11:31,798 --> 00:11:35,359
You're bruised all up and down your left
side. Sure a tree branch did all this?

200
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:40,202
You think my boyfriend did this?
He would never hit a woman. Ever.

201
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:41,399
Mm-hmm.

202
00:11:41,474 --> 00:11:44,409
The bruises doesn't look like
a tree branch hit you.

203
00:11:45,178 --> 00:11:47,112
Fine.

204
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,671
OK, you guys are going to think
I'm really weird,

205
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:53,515
but I was sort of up in the tree
when the lightning hit.

206
00:11:53,586 --> 00:11:56,384
- And... I fell.
- You climbed a tree in a thunderstorm?

207
00:11:57,423 --> 00:12:00,824
I really wanted it to be a surprise,
you know, for my boyfriend.

208
00:12:00,893 --> 00:12:05,694
And... um, I just... I had to see
if his psycho dog was in the yard

209
00:12:05,765 --> 00:12:08,598
because of, like,
the barking and stuff and...

210
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:13,205
I know. It sounds really weird.
Does it sound really weird?

211
00:12:13,273 --> 00:12:15,104
- Not at all.
- No.

212
00:12:15,174 --> 00:12:18,234
And the thing is,
I mean, he wasn't even there.

213
00:12:18,311 --> 00:12:19,300
The dog?

214
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:21,244
No. My boyfriend.

215
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:22,941
He wasn't even home.

216
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:26,645
I really shouldn't have
gotten out of bed.

217
00:12:28,321 --> 00:12:29,754
Oh, Dr. Shepherd.

218
00:12:29,822 --> 00:12:33,349
I've got a 34-year-old male with a blunt
head trauma and severe case of OCD.

219
00:12:33,426 --> 00:12:35,724
- Did you call for a psych consult?
- Yes.

220
00:12:35,795 --> 00:12:37,922
- Let me know when you get a CT.
- OK.

221
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,090
Hey.

222
00:12:42,168 --> 00:12:46,935
Hey. Hey, uh, sorry about
that, uh, valve replacement.

223
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:49,531
Oh, thank you. Laundry lost my caps.

224
00:12:49,609 --> 00:12:53,204
The guy didn't die because
you weren't wearing one of your caps.

225
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,213
I know that.

226
00:12:55,281 --> 00:12:59,081
I just prefer to operate wearing my own.
It's a comfort thing.

227
00:12:59,152 --> 00:13:03,418
Huh, well... I prefer having George
out of our apartment.

228
00:13:03,489 --> 00:13:05,923
So I guess we both have comfort things.

229
00:13:05,992 --> 00:13:08,927
- Yeah, what are you saying?
- Uh, you know, um...

230
00:13:09,762 --> 00:13:11,821
I have one of your caps in my locker.

231
00:13:11,898 --> 00:13:14,833
- Why do you have one of my caps...
- That's not the point.

232
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:18,496
The point is, um, is that I think
I'm going to keep it hostage.

233
00:13:19,505 --> 00:13:22,599
So you kick Bambi out
and you get your cap back.

234
00:13:22,675 --> 00:13:24,802
Oh, well.
I don't do well with ultimatums.

235
00:13:24,877 --> 00:13:27,675
Maybe you should think of it
more as a... trade.

236
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,575
Dr. Burke.

237
00:13:32,652 --> 00:13:35,553
I've got free time. Do you have
any cases you need help...

238
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:37,316
Actually, I do.

239
00:13:40,893 --> 00:13:44,294
Cristina has something of mine
and I need you to get it back.

240
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,267
OK, so just call Catherine.

241
00:13:49,335 --> 00:13:50,461
Yeah.

242
00:13:51,404 --> 00:13:54,999
Gretchen, would you mind
leaving us alone for a minute?

243
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:57,099
- OK.
- Thank you.

244
00:13:58,778 --> 00:14:04,410
She's my new baby. Six months sober,
she's already on the ninth step.

245
00:14:04,484 --> 00:14:07,180
- You must be proud of her.
- Always.

246
00:14:07,253 --> 00:14:10,689
- You're on a transplant list, Ollie?
- A couple of years now.

247
00:14:13,025 --> 00:14:17,018
The cirrhosis prevents blood
from flowing into your liver.

248
00:14:17,096 --> 00:14:21,692
So it's backing up into your esophagus.
Causing the ruptures. It's serious, Ollie.

249
00:14:22,468 --> 00:14:26,461
Well, of course it is. I mean, you don't
puke blood if it's not serious.

250
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:30,236
The question is: Can you treat it?

251
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:32,436
Maybe. Surgically.

252
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:39,982
We'll have to run more tests and...
whatever we do, it's a stop-gap.

253
00:14:41,454 --> 00:14:43,251
You need a new liver.

254
00:14:44,824 --> 00:14:48,555
Yet another reason
I should've laid off the sauce.

255
00:14:52,732 --> 00:14:54,723
You look scared.

256
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:56,860
I am scared, Ollie.

257
00:14:58,104 --> 00:15:01,039
Haven't seen you at a meeting
in a while.

258
00:15:01,107 --> 00:15:03,041
I know, I know.

259
00:15:03,109 --> 00:15:05,304
How've you been?

260
00:15:05,378 --> 00:15:09,371
- We're talking about you.
- Now I'm asking about you.

261
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:23,060
Ellis Grey's daughter's
working at the hospital.

262
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:26,826
Ellis is in a nursing home
with Alzheimer's.

263
00:15:29,268 --> 00:15:32,431
I try to go see her every chance I get.

264
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,504
You're having an affair with the woman
who drove you to your alcoholic bottom.

265
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:41,103
Ollie, we're not having an affair.
She's sick.

266
00:15:42,181 --> 00:15:44,411
- You're lying to your wife?
- I'm not lying.

267
00:15:44,484 --> 00:15:48,215
You're lying by omission.
You are having an emotional affair.

268
00:15:48,287 --> 00:15:50,619
And now you're lying
to your sponsor about it.

269
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,990
- You haven't been my sponsor in years.
- I still have a right to bust your ass

270
00:15:55,061 --> 00:15:57,586
- if I see you slipping.
- I'm not slipping.

271
00:15:57,663 --> 00:16:00,223
Not yet.
But you're making a pretty big mess.

272
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:17,105
- How many years you have now?
- Just passed 17.

273
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:21,644
I'm proud of you.

274
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,955
And I'm scared too.

275
00:16:31,163 --> 00:16:33,461
You got me sober, Ollie.

276
00:16:33,533 --> 00:16:35,558
You walked me through it.

277
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,831
And I'm going to walk you through this.

278
00:16:56,622 --> 00:16:59,352
OK. That's...

279
00:17:00,893 --> 00:17:02,827
She still has...

280
00:17:05,164 --> 00:17:06,290
Oh.

281
00:17:06,365 --> 00:17:08,094
You're a pervy little boy, George.

282
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:10,897
- You won't find the cap.
- I'll do your dishes for a month.

283
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,437
- I don't do dishes.
- Laundry.

284
00:17:12,505 --> 00:17:14,564
- Or laundry.
- Maybe that's why Burke has me around.

285
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,871
Interesting, interesting.
Are you having sex with him?

286
00:17:17,944 --> 00:17:21,243
- No.
- Then he likes having me around more.

287
00:17:21,314 --> 00:17:24,306
Why does it always have to be
a competition?

288
00:17:24,383 --> 00:17:26,317
- What do you want for the cap?
- You out.

289
00:17:26,385 --> 00:17:29,081
- I'm not leaving until Burke says so.
- Then no cap.

290
00:17:29,155 --> 00:17:31,521
- Now clean up my crap.
- No.

291
00:17:38,264 --> 00:17:39,993
Wow. Is that her spleen?

292
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:43,194
Looks like a grade three laceration.
Maybe a four.

293
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:46,534
What was she doing standing under a tree
in a thunderstorm?

294
00:17:46,606 --> 00:17:49,507
She wasn't standing under it.
She was climbing it.

295
00:17:49,575 --> 00:17:51,736
- Why?
- Uh...

296
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:54,143
I get the feeling
she's a little bit of a stalker.

297
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:56,545
- Do we need to call the police?
- I don't think so.

298
00:17:56,616 --> 00:17:59,551
I think she's more of a gentle stalker
than a "kill you" stalker.

299
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:04,386
Right. Well, let's hope she lives
to gently stalk another day.

300
00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:10,254
Hey, you don't believe
in that seven fatality thing, do you?

301
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:13,264
I believe this girl needs her spleen
removed immediately.

302
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:16,768
Go pick up her labs and get her
on the board. Then we'll break the news.

303
00:18:19,805 --> 00:18:22,638
It's almost over.

304
00:18:23,743 --> 00:18:26,234
You like horses, Izzie?

305
00:18:26,312 --> 00:18:28,576
Everybody likes horses.

306
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:30,980
That's not true.

307
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,281
You know,
horses are a great judge of character.

308
00:18:34,353 --> 00:18:37,618
You don't like horses,
means they don't like you.

309
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,557
- Huh.
- My uncle's a rodeo cowboy.

310
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:48,923
Huh. No kidding.

311
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:52,630
This is a big clot, Denny.
I can't get it with the catheter.

312
00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:56,440
I'm sorry.
We have to open your chest again.

313
00:18:58,044 --> 00:19:02,606
I was counting the clicks.
The... turn signal clicks.

314
00:19:02,682 --> 00:19:06,049
I couldn't move until it hit 333.

315
00:19:06,118 --> 00:19:08,348
The light was green,
but I couldn't move.

316
00:19:08,421 --> 00:19:10,981
I can't blame them for hitting me.

317
00:19:11,057 --> 00:19:12,991
How long have you had
these compulsions?

318
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:16,620
A little bit all my life, but it's been
out of control the last three years.

319
00:19:16,696 --> 00:19:19,426
- Onset at 30 is typical.
- Ruined a marriage.

320
00:19:19,498 --> 00:19:21,966
- I can't hold a job...
- OK, Mr. Fannon, do you...

321
00:19:23,602 --> 00:19:25,661
Is it clean?

322
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:28,536
- I need to know if it's clean.
- It's very clean.

323
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:31,075
- Any relatives with OCD?
- My mother.

324
00:19:31,143 --> 00:19:33,168
Killed herself at 38.

325
00:19:33,245 --> 00:19:35,713
Ruined her life.
Now it's ruining mine.

326
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:42,916
- Clean, clean, clean?
- Uh, we clean it between each patient.

327
00:19:42,988 --> 00:19:45,980
I think he needs you to say
"clean, clean, clean. "

328
00:19:46,692 --> 00:19:48,751
It's clean, clean, clean.

329
00:19:48,828 --> 00:19:50,523
Thank you.

330
00:19:50,596 --> 00:19:52,655
I know it's annoying. I can't help it.

331
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:58,035
Uh, find a penny, pick it up,
all day long you'll have good luck.

332
00:19:58,104 --> 00:20:00,971
Find a penny, pick it up,
all day long you'll have good luck.

333
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,440
- OK, Mr. Fannon, do you...
- Find a penny...

334
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:05,670
Repetitive rhymes, prayers.
It's classic.

335
00:20:05,745 --> 00:20:09,909
He needs to say it a specific number
of times. Probably a multiple of three.

336
00:20:09,982 --> 00:20:12,678
Let's get him in
before he decides to start again.

337
00:20:12,752 --> 00:20:16,051
Is everything all right
with, uh... that?

338
00:20:16,655 --> 00:20:20,091
Find a penny, pick it up,
all day long you'll have good luck.

339
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,150
Just, uh, don't look at him.

340
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:27,895
Hey.

341
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:29,366
Hi.

342
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:31,369
- Hey...
- Oh, hey.

343
00:20:31,437 --> 00:20:33,234
- Hi.
- Hi.

344
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,800
- I, uh... have to...
- Yeah.

345
00:20:37,877 --> 00:20:39,401
- Yeah.
- I do too.

346
00:20:39,478 --> 00:20:41,912
Yeah, I got... something too, so...

347
00:20:46,018 --> 00:20:48,213
I wish I had good news.

348
00:20:48,287 --> 00:20:50,721
The TIPSS procedure
you had last month failed.

349
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,223
What does that mean?

350
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,021
It means you're lucky
you got sober young.

351
00:20:55,094 --> 00:20:58,621
Ollie, it means I'm going to have to
put in a portacaval shunt.

352
00:20:58,697 --> 00:21:02,497
It's complicated.
It has only a 50% survival rate.

353
00:21:02,568 --> 00:21:04,433
What's my other choice?

354
00:21:10,109 --> 00:21:14,546
OK, then.
Um... you'll be the one to do it?

355
00:21:16,482 --> 00:21:19,451
I've performed this surgery nine times.

356
00:21:19,518 --> 00:21:21,782
Had four patients survive.

357
00:21:21,854 --> 00:21:25,950
It's perfect then.
I'll be your five out of ten.

358
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:33,992
- I'm not having surgery today.
- You have a ruptured spleen.

359
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:36,398
And I'm sure that the spleen
is very important.

360
00:21:36,468 --> 00:21:38,698
But I'm not having surgery today.

361
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:41,672
You can operate after midnight
but not one minute before.

362
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,471
If I thought it was safe I'd be more
than happy to wait until after midnight.

363
00:21:45,544 --> 00:21:48,911
However, I have a husband and a baby
at home who won't be happy.

364
00:21:48,981 --> 00:21:50,915
You know who else won't be happy? You.

365
00:21:50,983 --> 00:21:54,009
Your spleen is bleeding.
Spleen trumps horoscope.

366
00:21:54,086 --> 00:21:57,954
But it was more than just my horoscope.
I went out to my car this morning.

367
00:21:58,023 --> 00:22:01,550
Flat tire. That's a sign,
but I just changed the tire.

368
00:22:01,627 --> 00:22:03,595
Then there's a wreck on the freeway.

369
00:22:03,662 --> 00:22:06,324
Do I turn around and go home
like it's telling me to?

370
00:22:06,398 --> 00:22:10,300
No, I detour an hour out of my way
so that I can get to Kevin's house.

371
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:13,532
And when I get to Kevin's house,
I get struck by lightning!

372
00:22:13,606 --> 00:22:15,471
But you weren't struck by lightning.

373
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,304
I'll die, OK?

374
00:22:17,376 --> 00:22:22,040
If you operate on me today,
I will die because I know I will.

375
00:22:22,114 --> 00:22:23,741
Please, just...

376
00:22:23,816 --> 00:22:29,049
just call my boyfriend and tell him that
I'm having an operation at midnight.

377
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:31,112
Because he will want to be here.

378
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,181
- OK.
- Please.

379
00:22:37,229 --> 00:22:39,697
- Should I call Psych?
- You can give it a shot.

380
00:22:39,765 --> 00:22:42,063
In the meanwhile, get her down to ICU.

381
00:22:42,134 --> 00:22:44,728
Poor girl's going to kill herself
trying not to die.

382
00:22:50,676 --> 00:22:53,372
Izzie paints a pretty picture
because she likes you.

383
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:57,410
- OK.
- I'm just saying she likes you.

384
00:22:58,517 --> 00:23:00,712
Which is going to be hard on her.

385
00:23:01,921 --> 00:23:05,584
You mean... when I die?

386
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:10,588
Come on. I'm asking you... man-to-man.

387
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:15,464
With a clot in your pulmonary artery,

388
00:23:15,534 --> 00:23:19,026
it'll cut off the oxygen to your lungs
and you'll die of hypoxia.

389
00:23:19,104 --> 00:23:22,540
If the hypoxia doesn't kill you,
the strain on your heart will.

390
00:23:25,377 --> 00:23:28,540
- And the surgery?
- It's not a routine procedure.

391
00:23:28,614 --> 00:23:30,639
You're at serious risk for bleeding

392
00:23:30,716 --> 00:23:33,651
because of the anticoagulants
already in your system.

393
00:23:35,054 --> 00:23:37,818
What I'm saying is Izzie likes you.

394
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,188
And she's not going to be the one
to pull away.

395
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,992
How's your guy?

396
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:52,902
Brain's bleeding. Needs surgery.
Want to know why?

397
00:23:52,972 --> 00:23:55,702
He couldn't move his car
until he stopped counting.

398
00:23:55,774 --> 00:24:00,939
My girl? Ruptured spleen? Won't have
surgery because of her horoscope.

399
00:24:01,013 --> 00:24:04,642
Well, we should introduce them.
They make a nice crazy couple.

400
00:24:05,517 --> 00:24:09,283
Uh, you know what? I'm sitting
with Meredith. Have some self-respect.

401
00:24:09,355 --> 00:24:12,552
Dr. Burke's orders
trump any personal issues I might have.

402
00:24:12,624 --> 00:24:14,421
Is the craziness rubbing off on him?

403
00:24:14,493 --> 00:24:17,587
He's trying to...
stalk Burke's lucky cap from me.

404
00:24:17,663 --> 00:24:20,325
- Burke has hat juju?
- Apparently.

405
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:24,267
- And you're using it against him?
- Well, they're forcing me to.

406
00:24:25,637 --> 00:24:30,131
Because of the clarinet playing and the
running and all the breakfast food.

407
00:24:30,209 --> 00:24:34,737
You guys, this whole death cluster thing
is just ridiculous, right?

408
00:24:34,813 --> 00:24:36,974
I mean, just 'cause four died today

409
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:39,779
it doesn't mean
there'll be three more before midnight.

410
00:24:39,852 --> 00:24:41,979
It doesn't, Tinkerbell? For reals?

411
00:24:44,656 --> 00:24:48,524
- Are you worried about Denny?
- Yeah. Of course I am.

412
00:24:48,594 --> 00:24:50,494
He's my patient.

413
00:24:50,562 --> 00:24:54,157
But if you're asking me
if I'm "worried" about Denny, no.

414
00:24:54,233 --> 00:24:57,634
I'm sleeping with Alex, so...
It's just...

415
00:24:59,104 --> 00:25:03,768
Hey, did Burke say anything to you...
about Denny's surgery? Did he?

416
00:25:03,842 --> 00:25:06,003
- No. It's your case.
- Yeah. I know.

417
00:25:06,078 --> 00:25:08,672
I'm just asking that, you know,
as your boyfriend, if...

418
00:25:08,747 --> 00:25:12,274
I don't know why you'd care.
You're sleeping with Alex, right?

419
00:25:12,351 --> 00:25:13,909
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

420
00:25:13,986 --> 00:25:16,546
Right. No, whatever. I'm just saying.

421
00:25:16,622 --> 00:25:20,353
There's no such thing as a
death cluster. It's just stupid. Right?

422
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,358
I have to go convince my patient
to let us operate.

423
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:27,288
Mm-hmm.

424
00:25:27,366 --> 00:25:31,359
You're removing part of my skullcap?
Do you really have to do that?

425
00:25:31,437 --> 00:25:34,167
It's the only way to get to
the affected part of the brain.

426
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:37,800
And the operating room,
it's clean, clean, clean?

427
00:25:37,876 --> 00:25:41,277
Yes. It's clean, clean, clean.

428
00:25:43,449 --> 00:25:45,508
I'm going to go get ready.

429
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:55,348
- Can you stop that, please?
- No. Sorry. I wish I could.

430
00:25:57,963 --> 00:26:00,488
- She's judging me.
- No, she's not.

431
00:26:00,566 --> 00:26:04,024
Yes, she is. I've been living with this
for three years.

432
00:26:04,103 --> 00:26:07,504
And it's always the people who are
most like me who judge me the most.

433
00:26:07,573 --> 00:26:11,532
You're type A, right?
Straight A student? Top of your class?

434
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,702
Yes, I was.

435
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:16,009
You managed to turn your compulsions
into something productive.

436
00:26:16,081 --> 00:26:20,609
But we're cut from the same cloth.
That's why you can't stand me.

437
00:26:20,686 --> 00:26:22,449
Oh. Time to go.

438
00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:24,512
- But I'm not done.
- Uh, yes you are, sir.

439
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,683
- How many do you have to do?
- 96.

440
00:26:26,758 --> 00:26:28,851
Let him finish.

441
00:26:28,927 --> 00:26:31,293
Fine. I'll see you in the OR.

442
00:26:36,468 --> 00:26:38,595
There's Richard.

443
00:26:42,841 --> 00:26:46,777
Hey. Ollie says you should come in.
She says you need a meeting.

444
00:26:46,845 --> 00:26:48,870
Not now. Not here.

445
00:26:48,947 --> 00:26:53,975
Yeah. She said to say not to protect
your anonymity over your sobriety.

446
00:27:12,371 --> 00:27:16,307
God, grant me the serenity

447
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:19,640
to accept the things I cannot change,

448
00:27:19,711 --> 00:27:23,408
the courage to change the things I can,

449
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:27,077
and the wisdom to know the difference.

450
00:27:27,152 --> 00:27:28,915
Amen.

451
00:27:28,987 --> 00:27:30,318
Amen.

452
00:27:37,362 --> 00:27:39,626
Hey. How you feeling?

453
00:27:39,698 --> 00:27:43,964
Do me a favor?
My will is inside my nightstand.

454
00:27:44,036 --> 00:27:47,096
Just make sure
it gets in the right hands, OK?

455
00:27:47,172 --> 00:27:49,106
Why are you talking about your will?

456
00:27:50,209 --> 00:27:52,677
We have to be realistic, Dr. Stevens.

457
00:27:52,744 --> 00:27:54,336
Dr. Stevens?

458
00:27:54,413 --> 00:27:56,881
We got to be realistic.

459
00:27:56,949 --> 00:27:59,281
And if you can't, well, I can.

460
00:27:59,351 --> 00:28:01,876
No, wait, um...
can you just wait one minute?

461
00:28:01,954 --> 00:28:05,390
Denny, listen to me.
You're not going to die.

462
00:28:05,457 --> 00:28:08,187
You can't go into surgery
thinking you're going to die.

463
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:30,370
- You want me to pee in front of you?
- You have it on you.

464
00:28:30,449 --> 00:28:32,713
- Really? You want to go there?
- Yes.

465
00:28:32,784 --> 00:28:34,911
What are you going to do, Bambi?
Take it from me?

466
00:28:34,987 --> 00:28:38,388
Burke said to do whatever I have to do
and I'm going to do whatever.

467
00:28:38,457 --> 00:28:40,891
It's not there. You're not getting it.

468
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:45,487
Oh! No.
No, you're not going to... No.

469
00:28:45,564 --> 00:28:48,499
No. Oh! You've got my breast.
That's my breast.

470
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:51,035
That's my breast. My breast.

471
00:28:53,372 --> 00:28:54,999
Hey, Dr. Torres.

472
00:28:56,408 --> 00:28:59,206
Dr. O'Malley. You're aware
this is the women's restroom?

473
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:00,836
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good.

474
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:09,309
Dude. You called her ma'am.
She's never going to sleep with you now.

475
00:29:15,027 --> 00:29:16,517
Oh, hey. Have you seen Burke?

476
00:29:16,595 --> 00:29:19,792
He's on the phone with the laundry.
They can't find his scrub caps.

477
00:29:19,865 --> 00:29:22,766
That's what I got to tell him.
Cristina won't give hers back.

478
00:29:22,834 --> 00:29:24,495
Unless I'm ready to hit a woman.

479
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:27,094
Even though it's Cristina,
I won't cross that line.

480
00:29:27,172 --> 00:29:30,801
Wait! Wait, a moment.
Cristina has one of Burke's scrub caps?

481
00:29:30,876 --> 00:29:35,006
She's holding it hostage. Why do
you think I am stalking her? You...

482
00:29:44,356 --> 00:29:48,292
- Uh, ow. You're touching me.
- George says you have Burke's cap.

483
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,588
- So?
- Give it to him.

484
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:51,060
- No.
- Give it to him, Cristina.

485
00:29:51,129 --> 00:29:52,926
- What is with you?
- He needs it to operate.

486
00:29:52,998 --> 00:29:56,161
- No, he doesn't.
- That isn't your decision to make.

487
00:29:56,234 --> 00:30:00,500
Not when he's going in on Denny. Now, do
I have to physically take it from you?

488
00:30:00,572 --> 00:30:02,597
Are you threatening me?

489
00:30:02,674 --> 00:30:05,006
I swear to God, Cristina, I like you,
I really do.

490
00:30:05,077 --> 00:30:07,068
But I grew up in a trailer park

491
00:30:07,145 --> 00:30:10,376
and I am not above kicking
your pampered little Beverly Hills ass.

492
00:30:10,449 --> 00:30:13,418
And I do mean
physically kicking your ass.

493
00:30:23,995 --> 00:30:26,122
You don't have to follow me.

494
00:30:31,737 --> 00:30:33,728
Well, thank you.

495
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,507
How long have you had this?
It's one of my favorites.

496
00:30:40,011 --> 00:30:42,172
You know, you don't need it.

497
00:30:42,781 --> 00:30:45,909
I keep that cap in my locker
because every morning I look at it

498
00:30:45,984 --> 00:30:49,818
and I'm reminded of what I'm here for
and what I want to be.

499
00:30:49,888 --> 00:30:51,685
A great surgeon.

500
00:30:51,757 --> 00:30:54,590
A surgeon who is decisive,
and who executes,

501
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:58,026
and who doesn't need a piece of clothing
to give him an edge in surgery.

502
00:30:58,096 --> 00:31:00,030
You don't need it.

503
00:31:06,972 --> 00:31:10,237
I know. You're right.

504
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,237
I know I'm right.

505
00:31:18,316 --> 00:31:20,375
Nicely done, O'Malley.
Let's go scrub in.

506
00:31:26,758 --> 00:31:28,749
How am I doing?

507
00:31:30,295 --> 00:31:32,889
Nikki, is it possible
you're misreading the signs?

508
00:31:32,964 --> 00:31:36,832
I mean, isn't two surgeons
telling you that you need surgery

509
00:31:36,902 --> 00:31:38,995
a sign that you need surgery?

510
00:31:39,971 --> 00:31:42,030
Did you call my boyfriend?

511
00:31:42,107 --> 00:31:43,335
I did.

512
00:31:43,408 --> 00:31:45,899
What'd he say?

513
00:31:46,812 --> 00:31:50,270
He said he hasn't been your boyfriend
in a while.

514
00:31:55,554 --> 00:31:58,352
Did you tell him
I got struck by lightning?

515
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:09,864
- What did you say to him?
- Who?

516
00:32:09,935 --> 00:32:13,701
You know who. What the hell?
Why does Denny think he's dying?

517
00:32:13,772 --> 00:32:16,866
Well, maybe because
there's a good chance he is.

518
00:32:21,746 --> 00:32:26,615
Just so we're clear.
We're over, Alex. This is over.

519
00:32:26,685 --> 00:32:29,677
What? You're breaking up with me
over a corpse?

520
00:32:29,754 --> 00:32:31,346
No! No.

521
00:32:31,423 --> 00:32:35,519
I am breaking up with you
because on your very best day...

522
00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:42,196
that corpse is twice the man
you will ever be.

523
00:32:43,502 --> 00:32:46,232
You're not good enough for me, Alex.

524
00:32:46,304 --> 00:32:48,738
You're not good enough for anyone.

525
00:32:52,978 --> 00:32:55,947
You two, you're not scrubbing in.

526
00:32:57,015 --> 00:33:00,178
Whatever's going on with you,
I don't need it in my OR.

527
00:33:04,055 --> 00:33:08,151
- Fine. I'll watch from the gallery.
- No, no, you won't.

528
00:33:08,226 --> 00:33:12,162
You will take your energy as far away
from my OR as you can get.

529
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,265
Both of you.

530
00:33:29,848 --> 00:33:33,375
Find a penny, pick it up,
all day long you'll have good luck.

531
00:33:33,451 --> 00:33:37,114
Find a penny, pick it up,
all day long you'll have good luck.

532
00:33:37,188 --> 00:33:38,485
Find a penny, pick it up...

533
00:33:38,557 --> 00:33:41,856
We're going to give you
your anesthetic now.

534
00:33:41,927 --> 00:33:44,555
I'm sorry but we have to start.

535
00:33:44,629 --> 00:33:47,427
Find a penny, pick it up...

536
00:34:00,812 --> 00:34:03,872
It's a beautiful afternoon
to save lives, people.

537
00:34:04,983 --> 00:34:07,042
Let's have some fun.

538
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:28,906
The incision begins
along the left subcostal margin,

539
00:34:28,974 --> 00:34:33,343
across the right rectus,
and extending well into the flank.

540
00:34:33,411 --> 00:34:36,778
Dr. Bailey? It's Nikki Ratlin.

541
00:34:36,848 --> 00:34:38,372
I'll be all right, Bailey. Go.

542
00:34:42,787 --> 00:34:47,952
She, uh... yeah, she's bleeding out.
We need to get her to the OR now.

543
00:34:48,026 --> 00:34:50,358
I don't want an operation.

544
00:34:52,664 --> 00:34:57,397
Nikki, your boyfriend called.
He said he doesn't want you to die.

545
00:34:57,469 --> 00:34:59,266
Kevin called?

546
00:34:59,337 --> 00:35:01,737
Yes. Will you let us operate?

547
00:35:03,942 --> 00:35:05,637
Nikki?

548
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,144
Oh, code blue. Come on.

549
00:35:08,213 --> 00:35:10,943
Code Blue ICU, Code Blue ICU.

550
00:35:20,091 --> 00:35:22,389
- OK. Charge to 200.
- Charge.

551
00:35:27,298 --> 00:35:29,095
Clear.

552
00:35:37,175 --> 00:35:40,406
You have the back row of sutures
in place.

553
00:35:40,478 --> 00:35:43,811
Give me some... clear field.

554
00:35:43,882 --> 00:35:46,146
- Pressure's dropping.
- Hang another unit.

555
00:35:46,217 --> 00:35:48,447
I need the field clear.

556
00:35:50,722 --> 00:35:52,587
Clear!

557
00:35:54,092 --> 00:35:55,423
Charge 300!

558
00:35:55,493 --> 00:35:57,017
- Charge.
- Clear.

559
00:36:03,401 --> 00:36:06,928
That clip should've done it.

560
00:36:07,005 --> 00:36:09,098
I don't know.
There's something I'm missing.

561
00:36:13,912 --> 00:36:15,641
He's losing pressure, Dr. Burke.

562
00:36:15,714 --> 00:36:17,477
I'm working as fast as I can.

563
00:36:17,549 --> 00:36:19,176
We're losing him.

564
00:36:21,252 --> 00:36:24,983
- I heard they're dying left and right.
- See? Told you there'd be seven.

565
00:36:25,056 --> 00:36:27,149
Who? Who died?

566
00:36:27,225 --> 00:36:29,489
Don't know.
I bet it was that spleen chick.

567
00:36:29,561 --> 00:36:32,894
- She wouldn't let them operate.
- My money's on the chief's shunt.

568
00:36:32,964 --> 00:36:35,194
I have twenty
says Burke's guy went down.

569
00:36:35,266 --> 00:36:37,063
Dude's a walking time bomb.

570
00:36:37,135 --> 00:36:38,363
Bet.

571
00:36:46,411 --> 00:36:48,777
That makes five.

572
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,642
You lost her?

573
00:36:53,718 --> 00:36:55,583
Yeah.

574
00:36:55,653 --> 00:36:58,087
I heard there's a number six.

575
00:36:58,156 --> 00:36:59,885
Do you know who else?

576
00:37:00,592 --> 00:37:01,923
No.

577
00:37:01,993 --> 00:37:04,291
I'm going to inform the family.

578
00:37:21,346 --> 00:37:23,211
She made it through.

579
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,747
Thank you.

580
00:37:27,819 --> 00:37:29,787
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

581
00:37:29,854 --> 00:37:33,790
You're welcome. You're welcome.

582
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,964
<i>Superstition lies in the
space between what we can control...</i>

583
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:51,236
<i>and what we can't.</i>

584
00:37:54,145 --> 00:37:56,636
So, I wasn't one of the seven?

585
00:38:06,691 --> 00:38:09,251
It's past midnight. There were only six.

586
00:38:09,327 --> 00:38:11,795
- Then why are you crying?
- I'm not crying.

587
00:38:11,863 --> 00:38:14,093
You are too.

588
00:38:15,233 --> 00:38:17,224
Oh, damn it.

589
00:38:20,505 --> 00:38:22,996
I cannot fall for a patient.

590
00:38:24,742 --> 00:38:26,903
Oh.

591
00:38:26,978 --> 00:38:28,741
OK.

592
00:38:30,215 --> 00:38:32,445
Good luck with that.

593
00:38:45,763 --> 00:38:51,065
<i>Find a penny, pick it up,
and all day long you'll have good luck.</i>

594
00:38:57,308 --> 00:39:01,938
O'Malley, you are a sad excuse
for a man.

595
00:39:02,981 --> 00:39:05,211
- Excuse me?
- I know you heard me.

596
00:39:05,283 --> 00:39:07,376
You're like a whiny little girl.

597
00:39:09,554 --> 00:39:11,283
Alex.

598
00:39:11,356 --> 00:39:15,690
You know why he's not speaking to you?
Because he's not over you.

599
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,126
Man, you got laid, it went badly.

600
00:39:18,196 --> 00:39:20,960
A man would move on. But you?

601
00:39:21,032 --> 00:39:24,468
You mope around this place
like a dog that likes to get kicked.

602
00:39:24,535 --> 00:39:28,232
You make me sick, and if it wouldn't get
me thrown out of the program,

603
00:39:28,306 --> 00:39:31,833
I'd smash your pathetic little face
right into that locker.

604
00:39:41,419 --> 00:39:44,718
<i>No one wants to pass up a chance
for good luck.</i>

605
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:47,815
<i>But does saying it 33 times really help?</i>

606
00:39:47,892 --> 00:39:50,326
<i>Is anyone really listening?</i>

607
00:39:50,395 --> 00:39:52,386
Hey.

608
00:39:53,865 --> 00:39:56,732
I'll ask O'Malley to leave tonight.

609
00:39:56,801 --> 00:39:58,928
No, no, don't.

610
00:39:59,003 --> 00:40:03,133
- I thought you wanted him out.
- I do. But... not tonight.

611
00:40:07,278 --> 00:40:09,769
- Scrub cap.
- Oh.

612
00:40:10,715 --> 00:40:13,775
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

613
00:40:14,886 --> 00:40:17,013
<i>And, if no one's listening,</i>

614
00:40:17,088 --> 00:40:20,990
<i>why do we bother
doing those strange things at all?</i>

615
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:26,861
Hi. I didn't call.
I should have called. I just...

616
00:40:46,484 --> 00:40:51,046
Hi. This is George O'Malley calling.
You gave me your phone number.

617
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:55,787
I know I should have called sooner,
but I'm calling now.

618
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:00,092
And I just want to know... maybe
you want to go out with me sometime?

619
00:41:03,835 --> 00:41:07,134
Because... I...

620
00:41:07,205 --> 00:41:10,402
love to watch you set bones.

621
00:41:10,475 --> 00:41:12,807
And I... oh, I...

622
00:41:12,877 --> 00:41:17,644
rarely spend...
that much time in a women's restroom.

623
00:41:18,483 --> 00:41:21,350
And I really like you.

624
00:41:22,153 --> 00:41:23,484
So...

625
00:41:25,323 --> 00:41:27,314
is that a yes?

626

<i>We rely on superstitions

627
00:41:32,764 --> 00:41:34,891

628
00:41:39,437 --> 00:41:40,995
- Hey.
- Hey.

629
00:41:41,072 --> 00:41:44,940
- I'm sorry to hear about your patient.
- Thank you, Addison.

<i>And that life works in mysterious ways.</i>

631
00:41:48,513 --> 00:41:51,380
Here you go, babe.

632
00:41:53,584 --> 00:41:55,381
Thank you.

633
00:41:56,154 --> 00:41:58,247
Hmm. Ready?

634
00:41:58,322 --> 00:42:00,313
Yeah. Here you go. Thank you.
