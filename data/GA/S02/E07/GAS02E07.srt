00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,027
<i> Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:05,833
I'm touching the aorta.

3
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:07,668
- O'Malley.
- Yes, sir?

4
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,402
You just flew solo.

5
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,637
O'Malley plugs a hole with his finger

6
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:14,612
and everyone acts like he's a hero.
I have one off day...

7
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,844
- You chickened out.
- I hesitated briefly.

8
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,509
Why didn't you kiss Izzie?

9
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,880
- Cristina...
- It's my first day back.

10
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,049
- I've got...
- I'm not waiting forever.

11
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:29,323
OK, we're a couple. Whatever.
Don't make a big deal about it.

12
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:33,093
So pick me. Choose me. Love me.

13
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:37,125
Derek, have you ever thought that even
if I am Satan and an adulterous bitch,

14
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,034
I still might be the love of your life?

15
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:42,040
- You're staying with her.
- Yeah, she's my wife.

16
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:53,681
<i> Communication. It's</i>
<i>the first thing we really learn in life.</i>

17
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:04,160
She didn't even know he was married.
His wife just shows up and he dumps her.

18
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,959
I heard she flipped out.

19
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:09,729
What does she expect? She got what
she deserved, dating an attending.

20
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:13,569
Dating McDreamy. Have you seen
his hair? No guy is that perfect.

21
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,438
I think it's kind of sad.
She has to work here.

22
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:20,036
With him. With them. Everyone knows.

23
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:25,449
<i>Funny thing is, once we grow up, learn</i>
<i>our words, and really start talking,</i>

24
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,918
<i>the harder it becomes</i>
<i>to know what to say.</i>

25
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:31,184
<i>Or how to ask for what we really need.</i>

26
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,090
What do you need
to make this marriage work?

27
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,821
I need her to move to Seattle.

28
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,523
- That's just a...
- Addison. What do you need?

29
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:43,361
- Him to stop talking to Meredith.
- It's my... I work with her!

30
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:47,236
You want me to pick up my entire
practice and move here? Fine.

31
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,765
- I want you to give up your girlfriend.
- I did give up my girlfriend.

32
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:53,369
You wanted me to take you back,
I did. In Seattle.

33
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:57,542
- It's all about what he wants.
- I am not the same person anymore.

34
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,848
I know, you're a flannel-wearing,
wood-chopping fisherman.

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,081
I won't talk to her
if she behaves like this.

36
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,750
Sorry, guys. Time's up. Good progress.

37
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,390
Well, we have to do something.
Meredith's become like an exhibit.

38
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,831
Like that... Hey.
Like a zoo animal.

39
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,893
Like that rare panda
that everyone stares at.

40
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,805
Please don't say that to her face.
I think that panda died alone.

41
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,410
This could just as easily be you.
If people knew about you and...

42
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,707
Take that back.

43
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,341
No. I'm just saying we should
do something to cheer her up.

44
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,046
- Don't worry about it.
- It's under control.

45
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,315
- What do you guys have going on?
- Nothing.

46
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,550
- What?
- Where's Karev?

47
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,889
Probably somewhere
not kissing somebody.

48
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,484
Let's go, O'Malley.

49
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:46,260
Hey, so, after rounds,
we have something to show you.

50
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,237
- Mer? Meredith, can you hear us?
- She's not deaf.

51
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,566
Well, she looks weird.

52
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,199
Well, Derek didn't pick her.
She's gone mental.

53
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:58,301
- Meredith, have you gone mental?
- I have not gone mental.

54
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,245
See? OK, she's fine.
We have something to show you.

55
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:05,114
So whatever you do, do not get assigned
to a surgery this morning.

56
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,643
- If you give it a chance.
- I gave it a chance. He's a moron.

57
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,983
Straight ahead. That's the intern.

58
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,084
OK, yeah, mind your own business.

59
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:19,488
Mrs. Kimberly Griswold.
History of heart disease and surgeries.

60
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,864
In for a beating heart quadruple CABG.

61
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,129
- You're late.
- Yes, Karev. Nice of you to join us.

62
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:31,008
Why keep the heart beating, Dr. Yang?

63
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,277
I don't know.

64
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,542
What?

65
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,917
I have no idea.

66
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,617
Oh, I don't know either. Just don't.

67
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,921
Because of... Ow!

68
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,056
- Anyone else?
- Stress reduction...

69
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,961
- O'Malley.
- I know the answer.

70
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,023
I'm asking O'Malley.

71
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,561
Scar tissue's too deep.
Heart's too weak to start up again.

72
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,233
You only immobilize
the portion you're working on

73
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:05,141
and leave the rest of the heart
on its own.

74
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,210
- Welcome to the case.
- Thank you.

75
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,676
OK, move.

76
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,023
- What is that?
- PJs.

77
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,861
That is unfair.
He's punishing me for the elevator.

78
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,026
No, because you were late for rounds.

79
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,263
You want to tell me why you were late?

80
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,109
Dr. Shepherd needs somebody
on his nerve case today. Go.

81
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:43,511
And you three, brush up on how not to
embarrass me in front of the attendings.

82
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,211
Or I'll see to it
that your hearts stop beating. Clear?

83
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,584
Sorry, Dr. Bailey, we really apologize.

84
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,116
- What is going on?
- We found a case.

85
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,718
- You stole a case?
- Borrowed. From Psych.

86
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,822
The prelims...
This thing is totally unprecedented.

87
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,389
- And we found it.
- Stole it.

88
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,994
OK, found, stole, hijacked, whatever.
Meredith, behind this door

89
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:08,199
is the coolest medical mystery
I have ever seen.

90
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,539
Now, you can either walk away,
you know, guilt-free.

91
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:12,600
Mm-hm.

92
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:16,137
Or walk through this door,
risk your place in the program,

93
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:20,618
which could lead to spending the rest of
your life serving fries in bad clothing.

94
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,448
So you in?

95
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,189
Hell, yeah.

96
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,194
- Mr. Herman?
- Oh. No, please call me Shane.

97
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,824
I gotta hit the can. Again.

98
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,630
Seems like I gotta go every 30 seconds
these days.

99
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,534
- Just a guy.
- Wait for it.

100
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,868
I sure am glad to be
off that Psych floor.

101
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,269
- What's so special?
- Wait for it.

102
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,873
I'm not nuts. I'm just pregnant.

103
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,285
</i>

104
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:36,886
I was fine.
And then last month... huge belly.

105
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,896
My doctor just kept telling me
I was gaining weight with my wife.

106
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:44,198
- She's due on the 30th. It's our first.
- Congratulations.

107
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,501
The admitting intern shipped him
to Psych. Barely did a physical.

108
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,440
Hear that? It's not fluid.
There's something in there.

109
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,603
No joke there's something in there!

110
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:56,671
I've been able to feel it getting bigger
and bigger, growing in my... you know.

111
00:06:58,684 --> 00:06:59,742
My womb.

112
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:06,582
Yeah, I know I sound crazy.
I do. But I can prove it.

113
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,894
This room is supposed to be unoccupied.
Whose patient is this?

114
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,294
Hers.

115
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:16,631
Who transferred him? I don't have
any paperwork, any transfer documents.

116
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,829
Gimme a break.
We shuffle rooms all the time.

117
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,840
You know, if we need a bedpan changed,
we'll let you know.

118
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,001
OK, Doctor. You do that.

119
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,768
OK, where's his chart?

120
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,548
You steal a patient
and don't take the chart?

121
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,481
- That was your job.
- I was a lookout!

122
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,193
How you doing? You good?

123
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,332
You look good.

124
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,228
Come on. We're friends.

125
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,465
What's my name?

126
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,579
All right. So I don't know your name.

127
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,414
It's not like we can't talk.

128
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,216
You don't have to be a surgeon
for me to talk to you.

129
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,017
- Really?
- Really.

130
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,718
Because I thought
you only talked to attendings.

131
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:21,160
Now, Nicole, you've been having problems
with spasticity?

132
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,258
Mom?

133
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,826
She says the spasms
"make her legs dance."

134
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:28,203
We just wanted to make things
a little easier for her.

135
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,539
- She starts college this fall.
- Seattle Community.

136
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,705
Not that she wouldn't have her pick
of schools out of state.

137
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,805
But she's not ready for that yet.

138
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,317
What? Not because she's in a wheelchair?

139
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,582
Has Dr. Ostfeld mentioned
something called a cystoplasty?

140
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,317
It's an operation
to enlarge Nicole's bladder.

141
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,291
It creates an opening called a stoma.

142
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,193
It's improved life
for a lot of my paralysis patients.

143
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,164
- We toyed with the idea once.
- It's not for us.

144
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,859
Maybe we should revisit it?

145
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:59,234
An invasive procedure with a 20
per cent failure rate? I don't think so.

146
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,103
Nicole,
it's something worth considering.

147
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,802
You wouldn't have to wear the catheter
all the time.

148
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:09,109
Not to mention the medical benefits.
It would improve your quality of life.

149
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,445
You know,
you'd be like girls your own age.

150
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,644
You'd be in control of your own bladder.

151
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,778
You'd have a more normal sex life.

152
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,054
When that becomes an issue, of course.

153
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,530
We're here for the pain procedure.
That's it.

154
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,397
They share the same brain.
She's not getting surgery.

155
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,561
Take Nicole with you everywhere today.

156
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:35,368
Labs, to coffee, take her anywhere.
Just get her away from her parents.

157
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,807
You want me to baby-sit
the wheelchair chick?

158
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,402
Nicole. She thinks you're cute.

159
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,947
She's a teenager,
she might even listen to you.

160
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:45,483
You want me to convince her
to get that surgery.

161
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,952
- Convince her to make the decision.
- How am I supposed to do that?

162
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:53,685
Dr. Karev, you're creative.
You'll think of something. Thank you.

163
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,920
This will be
an extensive operation,

164
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,558
even for an open-heart veteran
like yourself.

165
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:05,263
My room was bigger last time.
It was brighter. More sun.

166
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,568
Alan, this water is warm.
I need more ice.

167
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,474
I'm sending you in for a nuclear scan,

168
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,738
then we'll get you into the OR
this afternoon.

169
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,677
You do understand all of the risks?

170
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,682
I've been through it too many times
to not understand.

171
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,709
Get the blinds. Open the blinds.
This room is depressing.

172
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,255
I'll check back a little later.

173
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:27,554
Take her for the thallium scan,
pick up her X-rays on the way.

174
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,790
Dr. Burke, thank you for choosing me
to assist you today.

175
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:36,328
- Well, you're my guy, O'Malley.
- I am? I mean, yeah.

176
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:40,498
Hand me the tissues. No, no, wait.
Hospitals have germs.

177
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,905
Get my hand sanitizer out of my case.

178
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,135
Why would you be with someone
who makes you that unhappy?

179
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,908
- Excuse me?
- I mean like...

180
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,074
Well, like you're happy with Cristina.

181
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,517
And she's happy. Well, happier.
You know, Cristina-happy,

182
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,454
which is not
normal people's happy but...

183
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,489
But, you know,
happy since you guys started...

184
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,321
Scans. I'm on it. I'm your guy.

185
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,759
<i> Dr. Hamill, 4147.</i>

186
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,837
I'm an idiot.

187
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,737
Just look at this.

188
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,001
Hi. Hello.

189
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,273
Meredith.
Maybe we could, you know, talk?

190
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,249
No.

191
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,049
OK.

192
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,582
Beep-beep.

193
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:35,149
- What'd you do to get stuck with me?
- Nothing.

194
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,390
Come on. I know you're not just
wheeling me around for kicks.

195
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,297
- Nope. I was late for rounds.
- Why?

196
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,227
'Cause I had things to do.
Hey, Izzie!

197
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,634
Izzie!

198
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,175
Hey, dollface!

199
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:58,407
I was gonna ask you a favor. Since
you're better with people than I am...

200
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,349
- No.
- You haven't heard what...

201
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,717
No. You're like a broken record.

202
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:06,224
God, you're only ever nice or friendly
or anything

203
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:10,626
when it's convenient for you.
So no to your favor. No to you. No.

204
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:14,655
- What's up with you?
- I put on a dress. I did my hair.

205
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,703
I had one night off in two weeks,
and I used it on you.

206
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,967
And what do I get? Nothing.
No respect. No apology.

207
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,341
You couldn't even be bothered
to kiss me good night.

208
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,676
You know what? You're a coward.

209
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,807
And you're just as shallow as you seem.

210
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:35,582
So I am done trying to be your friend,
or whatever. I'm over it.

211
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,590
She's really mad at you.

212
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,995
A urine sample is the last
thing we need, Mr. Herman.

213
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,626
- Uh, meet Shane's wife, Tina.
- Hey.

214
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,260
She's also pregnant.

215
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:54,500
What precipitated the psychotic episode

216
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:58,339
- that got you admitted to the hospital?
- It wasn't an episode, OK?

217
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,311
And I'm not psychotic, I am pregnant.

218
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,180
I mean, wouldn't you freak out
if you were me? Honey, did you bring it?

219
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,014
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, good.

220
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,418
I can prove to everyone
that I'm not crazy.

221
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,053
That is my patient.

222
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,616
He's ours now. If you wanna fight me
for it I guarantee you I'll win.

223
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:18,788
- What is going on in here?
- Dr. Bailey, just a moment here.

224
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:22,356
- Please, look at his abdomen.
- It's a male hysterical pregnancy.

225
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,561
It's a Psych case, and it's mine.

226
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,730
It's not hysterical! I am pregnant!

227
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,467
See? Psych.

228
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,601
No, his belly is distended.
There's no signs of ascites.

229
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,976
And I clearly feel a mass
with deep palpation. Surgical.

230
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,413
- Guys.
- I told you I could prove it.

231
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,711
- Psych!
- Surgical!

232
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:41,514
- You're doctors. Act like it.
- Guys...

233
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,487
- Psych!
- Surgical!

234
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:49,091
Guys! Shane took a pregnancy test.
And it's positive.

235
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,895
He's definitely a surgical patient now.

236
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,872
Do not think for a moment
I condone stealing patients.

237
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,515
That said... way to go.

238
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:16,948
The first pregnancy test I took
was a joke, to make Tina laugh.

239
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,014
We didn't think it would lead to,
you know, this.

240
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,822
Mr. Herman, I can assure you,
you are in no way pregnant.

241
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,829
That's a relief. To hear it officially.

242
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,665
- But why was that stick blue?
- We're going to find out.

243
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:35,070
Stevens. Do a shotgun workup,
including tumor markers.

244
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,870
And get CT to make some room
for us in line.

245
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,977
What's this for again?

246
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,674
Uh...
Medical journals, monthly case reports.

247
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,580
Annual banquet highlight reels.

248
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,320
- Hey, whose pager is that?
- Mine. But I found him.

249
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,588
- So can someone else go?
- No, we don't ignore pages, Yang.

250
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,926
Will you excuse me?

251
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,531
...to get to the top.

252
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,005
We'll be finished soon,
right, Dr. Bailey?

253
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,405
Good. OK.

254
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,107
Patient in 4243 needs a rectal.

255
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:22,483
Then I've got two infected wounds,
a Foley, a groin abscess,

256
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,545
four debridements and a...

257
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,517
case of explosive diarrhea.

258
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:33,225
- You're kidding me, right?
- I'm not known for my humor.

259
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:38,828
Why did you page me about...?
None of these are my patients.

260
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:42,601
You're Bailey's intern, right?
Then these are your patients.

261
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:46,577
Debbie here.

262
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,671
A portion of intestine
is used to enlarge the bladder,

263
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:52,911
and then we construct a pathway
to a hole in the belly button.

264
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,613
It's a very tiny hole.
It's virtually invisible.

265
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,248
She could wear a bikini
and no one would ever know.

266
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,189
A bikini?
She doesn't know how to swim.

267
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,319
She could go to the beach,
lie in the sun, hang out with friends.

268
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,590
She's so self-conscious now.

269
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,497
- Exactly.
- Nicole could have friends her own age.

270
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,865
- When will Nicole be back?
- After her labs.

271
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:14,030
Just think about her future.
Nicole could be independent.

272
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,473
She could go to college anywhere,
have a job, her own apartment.

273
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:21,502
- Date. Get married.
- These labs are taking a long time.

274
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,572
She can spend more than 20 minutes
away from us, Elaine.

275
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,813
- I'm asking about my only child.
- She's not a child anymore.

276
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:30,787
She's my child.
She'll always be my child.

277
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:35,355
Alan! Watch your step.
You're hitting my chair.

278
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,361
- I'm sorry.
- And hold on to my bag.

279
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,989
- I got it.
- Don't rummage through it!

280
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,465
<i> Dr. Glenn...</i>

281
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:46,197
"Please" and "thank yous"
were never her strong suit.

282
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:49,138
- You're a very patient person.
- Years of practice.

283
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,177
- Whoops.
- Oh.

284
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,235
I just try to keep her calm.

285
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,881
They didn't think she'd survive
the first surgery,

286
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,850
let alone three more.

287
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,580
Here it is, ten years later...
She's still here.

288
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:09,454
Yeah, it's a miracle that she's still
alive. That's what everyone says.

289
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,155
What do you say?

290
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:16,634
Uh... It's right there in the vows.
"In sickness and in health," right?

291
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,765
Thanks.

292
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:30,011
A pregnant guy? You had a pregnant guy
and you didn't tell me?

293
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,909
Well, we can get you floor space
in the OR for 50 bucks.

294
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,147
We don't even know
what's wrong with him.

295
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,713
Whatever is inside has to come out.
We're just brokering a few deals.

296
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,158
Like backstage passes.
Want in on the cash?

297
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,161
- No.
- I didn't need a pregnant guy.

298
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,392
I was Burke's new go-to guy.
But that's over, thanks to you.

299
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,900
- He didn't know that I knew...
- Stop talking.

300
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,263
What on earth...?

301
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,173
Hi.

302
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:07,514
- I'm Alex's charity case.
- I like her already.

303
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,486
- Are you volunteering?
- Don't ask.

304
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,217
Why? It's not like we have any idea
what's going on

305
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,418
in your tiny, tiny, tiny little brain.

306
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,893
She has a point.

307
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,953
I am hungry!

308
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,762
So this is cool. A real live lunchtime.

309
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:26,462
In a real cafeteria,
with trays and friends.

310
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:29,598
- We're not his friends.
- Isn't there a cafeteria at school?

311
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,610
- I'm home-schooled by my parents.
- That explains a lot.

312
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,272
Are you the "cool kids" around here
or something?

313
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,406
What would make you think that?

314
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,713
Seems like everyone's talking about you.

315
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,412
I feel sorry for her.

316
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,284
... drop her.

317
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:52,924
The guys and I were taking bets
on who'd get to scan this dude.

318
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,625
Beers are on me tonight!

319
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,964
Next up,
the wager on what this thing is.

320
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,367
- You're taking bets?
- On what's inside his belly.

321
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,963
You want in? Ten bucks.

322
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,634
Well, we know it's not fat, fluid,
or fetus, so...

323
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,610
Jeez.

324
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,669
Are those teeth?

325
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,249
Cristina is going to be so mad
she missed this.

326
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:16,684
I was told to page you, and only you,
if something like this came up.

327
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,382
Who told you? Bailey?

328
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,820
- No.
- Oh, yes.

329
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:25,489
And all I can say is, you must
have made one serious faux pas.

330
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,393
- I hate vomit.
- You're going to need this.

331
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,514
Bailey knows.

332
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,125
- Knows what?
- She knows.

333
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:04,363
- Well, O'Malley knows. Why not Bailey?
- So you didn't tell her?

334
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,028
- Why would I?
- This is bad.

335
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:09,699
We have to manage the damage ourselves
before it spins out of control.

336
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,141
- That means coming clean to the chief.
- What?

337
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,180
- Then no one has anything to say.
- No. No way. No way.

338
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,442
- That's the only way.
- Good morning.

339
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,178
- Morning, Chief.
- Right. Thank you, Dr. Burke.

340
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,516
You're welcome. Great board, Chief.

341
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,461
Could you make sure
they get the breathing tube

342
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:33,430
out of my throat
right after surgery this time?

343
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,931
Are you trying
to cut off my circulation?

344
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,198
He's just doing his job.

345
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,870
What did you say?

346
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,035
I said he's just doing his job.

347
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:49,274
Well, I don't really care
whose job he's doing.

348
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:53,409
He's squeezing my arm off.
Are you just gonna sit there?

349
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,919
Shut up, Kim.

350
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,319
Just shut up, huh?

351
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,920
- Hey.
- You complain to me,

352
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,933
about me, around me,

353
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:12,596
all day, every day.

354
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,868
A little silence would be nice.

355
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,843
A few measly minutes of quiet!

356
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,140
- Can't you for once...
- Mr. Griswold.

357
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:26,616
...in your life just shut up?!

358
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,061
- What we got?
- She had a Levine sign.

359
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,729
EKG shows ST-elevations
in the inferior leads.

360
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:50,335
She's having a heart attack.
Give her four migs of morphine.

361
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,343
Run nitro at ten mics per minute.

362
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:55,938
Let's do this fast
so we can get her into surgery, people.

363
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,606
I did this.

364
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,975
I did this to her.

365
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:03,980
Mesenteric teratoma, Chief.

366
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,286
- In an adult male.
- Is this possible?

367
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:09,987
It is now.
Large bilobed cystic lesion...

368
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:14,089
- With a calcified structure.
- A deformed mandible.

369
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,658
Labs show elevated HCG levels.

370
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:20,728
That explains the false positive
on the pregnancy test.

371
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,639
- Which also means...
- Probably malignant.

372
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,110
You OK? You look a little green.

373
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,771
I think he needs some air, Chief.

374
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,247
Deep breaths, Mr. Herman.

375
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:37,345
It's just... most of this medical-speak
goes right over my head.

376
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:42,485
You have what's called a teratoma.
And it's really very rare in adults.

377
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,188
Which is why you're so popular.

378
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:47,720
It's just a mass of cells that's
probably been there your whole life,

379
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,357
- only now...
- It's growing.

380
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:53,131
Yeah. Growing jaw bones. And toenails.
And, uh, clumps of hair.

381
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,797
Yeah, I've been listening.

382
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:58,331
- No one's really talking to us.
- Just about you.

383
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,005
- I know what that's like.
- What did I miss?

384
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:07,776
Is that... Is that rectal jelly
on your scrubs?

385
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:18,329
Dr. Bailey, all the attention, all the
people, they are making them panic.

386
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,832
When you said you'd found
a lunch spot with a view,

387
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,872
I knew I should have
taken you literally.

388
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,964
I found it in my <i>Best of Seattle</i> guide.

389
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:33,499
It's hardly brown-bagging it
on top of the Empire State Building,

390
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:37,639
but they do have
these cute little viewfinders.

391
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:40,184
You always find something
to complain about.

392
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:44,621
OK. Is there anything
that you like about me anymore?

393
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,624
Because if there is,
I really need to know now.

394
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:51,890
Well, I like that you like cute little
viewfinders in every city you live in.

395
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:55,558
I don't live here yet.

396
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,805
Are you going to stop
talking to Meredith?

397
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,865
- I will.
- When?

398
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,809
Today? Tomorrow? Next week?

399
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,870
Maybe I'm not ready yet.

400
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,786
Are you ever going to be ready, Derek?

401
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:19,749
- What if I say no?
- Then I'm not moving here.

402
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:25,325
Well, I guess we're at an impasse then.

403
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:36,095
Dr. Yang.
We never finished our conversation.

404
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:39,940
Yes, we did. We decided we're not
going to tell you-know-who about us.

405
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:43,572
We decided? You're worried about
your career and your reputation.

406
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,082
What if he hears about us
through the grapevine?

407
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,985
- He doesn't have to hear at all.
- He will. It's just a matter of time.

408
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:53,047
Unless you're hesitating
because of some different reason.

409
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:54,989
You are not thinking this through.

410
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,995
Like not wanting to admit
to this relationship at all.

411
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,830
We are a couple.

412
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,604
- Fine.
- Burke...

413
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,665
I said fine.

414
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,639
So what's up with you
not wanting to get this procedure?

415
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:23,111
- I'm fine the way I am.
- Good point. Your choice.

416
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:30,287
So you're not going to
try and talk me into it?

417
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,694
Right now I'm going to study.

418
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,927
<i>Nuclear something-fancy-name-ology.</i>

419
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,437
Is that why you were late?
You were studying?

420
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:42,632
No.

421
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,834
Is that girl Izzie your girlfriend?

422
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,138
No.

423
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:49,136
Do you want her to be your girlfriend?

424
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:53,651
I got stuck with you because I was late,
so if you don't mind, kid, kinda busy.

425
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:57,218
- I'm 18, you know.
- What?

426
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,917
I'm not a kid. I'm 18.

427
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:03,154
And I don't have to stay down here.
I could go back to my room.

428
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,593
So go.

429
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,759
- Izzie's right. You're an ass.
- And I'm not an ass.

430
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:15,670
Well, OK, I am an ass.
But I'm a cute ass, right?

431
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,843
How come you didn't kiss her?

432
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,904
Thought you were leaving.

433
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:28,679
If I had a chance to kiss
someone I liked, I wouldn't hesitate.

434
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:32,553
If I had the chance to lose the urine
bag on my ankle, I wouldn't hesitate.

435
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:35,957
Then again I don't let my mommy
do all my talking for me.

436
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:41,754
- I don't like you.
- Yes, you do.

437
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,130
- Jerk.
- Motormouth.

438
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:45,362
- Baby-sitter.
- Two-wheeler.

439
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,701
Now that's politically incorrect.

440
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:56,636
OK. Looks like Mrs. Griswold
is doing well.

441
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,207
<i> Suction.</i>

442
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:04,984
<i>Can we fix the mechanical stabilizer</i>
<i>here? Right now it's gonna hit...</i>

443
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:26,641
Look at that. A perfectly exposed,
partially numb beating heart.

444
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:28,440
It's a beautiful thing.

445
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:29,673
<i> Code Red!</i>

446
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,581
- Stand back!
- It caught fire.

447
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,815
- Her heart's on fire.
- We have to save Mrs. Griswold.

448
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:38,947
Begin fire protocol. Code Red.

449
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,958
We need wet towels!

450
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,460
- Disconnect the leads.
- Got it.

451
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:47,430
Any unnecessary personnel
in this room, evacuate now.

452
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,488
Shut down the O2.

453
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:51,330
- On it.
- Start manual respiration.

454
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:57,100
OK, I've got the Ambu bag.
Starting manual respiration.

455
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,341
Gotta control this bleeding.

456
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,642
<i> Her vitals are stabilizing.</i>

457
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,880
We might just have a chance.

458
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,024
She was on fire.

459
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:16,856
I have never seen anything like that.
What was that?

460
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:19,863
- It was a freak accident.
- I mean, she was on fire.

461
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:23,958
- Yeah, you already said that.
- I know. But she was... on fire.

462
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,902
- George. You OK?
- She was on fire.

463
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:31,208
Hey. That was intense. Are you OK or...

464
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,267
I'm fine. O'Malley! Let's go.

465
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,079
I am so over this!

466
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:49,688
Hey, I heard a heart caught on fire
in the OR?

467
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:53,754
I am the best intern you've got. And you
are wasting me on puke and boils.

468
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:56,699
And I get it, I even deserve it,
but please...

469
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,032
you can't keep me away
from this surgery.

470
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:02,540
I earned this surgery.
I stole this surgery.

471
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:06,236
- What are you talking about, Yang?
- You. Punishing me.

472
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,642
You have no idea what I'm talking about,
do you?

473
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,983
Well, then, who has
been paging me all day?

474
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:19,148
The nurses have been on me nonstop.

475
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:25,222
Bit of respect and you could have saved
yourself a very long day, Dr. Yang.

476
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:30,692
- Hi, this is Debbie.
- Pissing off the nurses.

477
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:34,895
- Stupid.
- Well, I can still scrub in, right?

478
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,270
He wants me to move here,
Richard. To pick up everything and move.

479
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:44,213
Don't stay for him, Addison.
Stay for me. Stay for yourself.

480
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:47,274
- Richard, I...
- In Seattle, you'll be front-page news.

481
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:50,753
With your reputation and the money
I'll put into promoting you,

482
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:55,225
Seattle Grace will become the foremost
neonatal hospital west of Manhattan.

483
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:05,959
- You're serious?
- I'll put my money where my mouth is.

484
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,843
- Turn around. Walk away.
- From what?

485
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,009
- From my intern.
- What? I wasn't.

486
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:22,211
Yeah. Yes, you were.

487
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:26,383
Come on, look, you can't do this.
You don't have the right. Not anymore.

488
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:29,290
- I just want to find out if she's OK.
- She's not.

489
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,955
She's a human traffic accident and
everybody's looking at the wreckage.

490
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,829
She's doing the best she can
with what she has left.

491
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,667
I know you can't see this because you're
in it, but you can't help her now.

492
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:44,697
You'll only make it worse. Walk away.
Leave her to mend.

493
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,511
Go on!

494
00:30:56,187 --> 00:31:00,988
It's not that I don't want
the operation. I do. I want things.

495
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:05,120
It's just... What if I'm not ready?

496
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,357
Ready for what?

497
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,297
For everything.

498
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:13,394
For taking care of myself,
for being on my own.

499
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,330
For sex.

500
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,398
For love.

501
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,611
I've never had a boyfriend.

502
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,974
I've never even been kissed.

503
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:31,053
I'm like the oldest living
prospective college freshman

504
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:33,215
not to go to first base.

505
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:36,886
- Nah.
- It's mortifying.

506
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:39,623
There are way older losers than you,
trust me.

507
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,862
Alex.

508
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:52,234
Would you kiss me?

509
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:55,603
What?

510
00:31:56,614 --> 00:32:00,209
I know you're a doctor, I'm your
patient, and it's against the rules.

511
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:03,049
But I would never tell anyone.

512
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:21,129
For a kiss to be really good,
you want it to mean something.

513
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:25,232
You want it to be with someone
you can't get out of your head.

514
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:29,110
So that when your lips finally touch,
you feel it everywhere.

515
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,911
A kiss so hot and so deep
you never want to come up for air.

516
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,450
You can't cheat your first kiss, Nicole.

517
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:41,219
Trust me, you don't want to.

518
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:47,094
Because when you find that right person,
a first kiss is everything.

519
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:55,934
- Her heart...
- Caught on fire.

520
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,407
There will of course
be an investigation.

521
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:02,003
But you should know
this is not unusual as it sounds.

522
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,810
Your wife is going to be fine.
She's well.

523
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:09,819
We completed the operation. And I expect
that she will make a full recovery.

524
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,558
Mr. Griswold?

525
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,641
So... That's it, isn't it?

526
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:37,045
Her heart caught on fire

527
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:41,415
in the middle
of her fifth open-heart operation,

528
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,378
and she survived.

529
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:54,831
Well, she's like some...

530
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,067
some mythical monster.

531
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,640
She's never gonna die!

532
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,834
Mr. Griswold?

533
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:08,675
Mr. Griswold, I know this is an
emotional time for you.

534
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,345
- If you'd like to wait...
- Wait?

535
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:16,751
No, no, I'm not waiting any longer.

536
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:26,427
You tell her... Tell her...

537
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:30,429
Hell, tell her...

538
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:34,335
she'll survive without me!

539
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,514
We can add two more, standing room only.

540
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,782
- Hey, hands off!
- What is going on in here?

541
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,056
- Everybody out!
- We already have a...

542
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:58,255
Out! Mr. Herman is a patient,
a surgical patient,

543
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:02,663
who's sick and embarrassed
and tired of being stared at!

544
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:08,103
You two, this isn't a zoo!
Out, out, out!

545
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:12,040
You know, if all of you want to point
and whisper and stare at me,

546
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,702
knock yourselves out!

547
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:17,009
Look at Meredith, isn't she sad,
pathetic and heartbroken?

548
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:20,346
Maybe she's gone mental. Maybe I have!

549
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:23,410
But leave Mr. Herman alone!

550
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,718
You should be ashamed of yourself.

551
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,156
And what are you looking at?

552
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:55,246
So do you tell his wife, or should I?

553
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,217
This is...

554
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:18,798
I want to thank you for helping me out
in the surgery today, O'Malley.

555
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:23,540
It was a high-pressure situation today
and you were on top of it.

556
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,809
Well, thank you, Dr. Burke.

557
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:32,778
And, I'm sorry about before,

558
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,826
about, you know,
bringing up you and Cristina.

559
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:38,919
That... just like...

560
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:57,137
You're still my guy, O'Malley.
Still my guy.

561
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:08,188
I always thought I'd hold your hand
in the delivery room.

562
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:13,926
I'll let you know
when the surgery is over, OK?

563
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:16,899
OK. This is as far as I go.

564
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,207
Hey, Dr. Grey.

565
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,368
Don't let them show it off, you know.

566
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:29,470
Put it in a jar,
or pass it around or nothing.

567
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,538
- Your teratoma?
- Yeah.

568
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:36,218
I feel weird about having
my insides on display like that.

569
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,380
- You promise?
- I promise.

570
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:42,549
<i> At the end of the day,</i>

571
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:47,030
<i>there are some things</i>
<i>you just can't help but talk about.</i>

572
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:56,595
You really want to be the one
to dispose of this, Grey?

573
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,642
I made a promise.

574
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,807
I am worried about my career.

575
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:08,147
I'm worried about my reputation
and my...

576
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:22,188
I will not be Meredith Grey.

577
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:24,734
People won't make allowances for...

578
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,794
This is not about making allowances
and you know that.

579
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,936
- Everyone will know.
- That's the point.

580
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:33,476
I don't want to tell the chief, OK?

581
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:37,310
I just... don't.

582
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:41,109
<i>Some things we just don't want to hear.</i>

583
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:51,161
<i>And some things we say</i>
<i>because we can't be silent any longer.</i>

584
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,364
I'm getting the operation.

585
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:00,563
- She's clearly not considering...
- She is considering.

586
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,629
I'm getting the operation.

587
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:06,803
You two talk and talk. But you notice
how you never ask me anything?

588
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:09,437
Part of it's my fault. I let you do it.

589
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,282
But I'm not cheating anymore.

590
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,808
I'm not sitting back
and giving over control,

591
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:20,516
because I am ready
to handle things for myself.

592
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:23,185
<i>Some things are more than what you say.</i>

593
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,251
<i>They're what you do.</i>

594
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,727
I appreciate your candor, Preston.

595
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:30,164
I can take whatever
you threw at Shepherd.

596
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:33,260
- I don't need special treatment.
- You're not gonna get any.

597
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:37,865
You're not married. You're not hiding.
You came to me.

598
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:40,502
You clearly value your relationship.

599
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:46,548
What you two have together,
I understand that, Preston.

600
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:49,018
And it does matter.

601
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:52,351
<i>Some things you say</i>
<i>because there's no other choice.</i>

602
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:05,863
I've given it a lot of consideration.
And I've decided to move to Seattle.

603
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:11,567
And, well, Meredith won't be
an issue anymore. She's out of my life.

604
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:15,100
It's... Well, it's taken care of.

605
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:18,478
I must say, this is remarkable progress.

606
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,582
I applaud both of you.

607
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:25,782
You've taken a very significant leap.

608
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,950
That's what marriage is about.

609
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:30,857
Compromise. Right?

610
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:36,730
Yeah, it's, well, it's about,
well, give and take.

611
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:40,396
<i>Some things you keep to yourself.</i>

612
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:48,234
She yelled at you?

613
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:50,371
Well, we probably deserved it.

614
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:54,748
We sold $485 worth of tickets
to the surgery.

615
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:57,476
Yeah.

616
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:59,546
Did you sell more?

617
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,459
- Oh, yeah.
- Out of control.

618
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,227
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey.

619
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:20,469
So you guys really don't have
anything else to talk about?

620
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:21,841
No.

621
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,742
<i>And not too often,</i>

622
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:33,114
<i>but every now and then...</i>

623
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:36,048
What?

624
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:38,452
What?

625
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:42,090
<i>... some things simply</i>
<i>speak for themselves.</i>

626
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,439
Good night.

627
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,991
- Wow.
- Seriously.
