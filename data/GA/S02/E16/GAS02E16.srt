1
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,871
<i> It's a look</i>
<i>patients get in their eyes.</i>

2
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:10,942
<i>There's a scent. The smell of death.</i>

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,311
<i>Some kind of sixth sense.</i>

4
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:19,713
<i>When the great beyond is headed for you,</i>
<i>you feel it coming.</i>

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,955
<i>What's the one thing you've</i>
<i>always dreamed of doing before you die?</i>

6
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,525
<i>OK, hello? Clearly not my dream.</i>

7
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:10,434
George.

8
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:17,064
You're the strongest,
most masculine man I have ever known.

9
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,207
You're smarter than me.
And you've got really great hair.

10
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,377
I'm in love with you, George.

11
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,084
I always have been
and I always will be.

12
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,234
<i>See? I told you. Not my dream.</i>

13
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,905
Oh. OK, this is the last time
I'm going to tell you this.

14
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:54,242
If you're gonna clog up the toilet,
you've gotta use a plunger.

15
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,282
Or we'll make you crap in the backyard.

16
00:01:56,349 --> 00:02:01,252
What are you doing on the floor?
Get up. Something's wrong with Meredith.

17
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,482
I'm just not going.

18
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:07,219
You have to go to work. You're
an intern. Saving lives is not optional.

19
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,591
Yes, it is. I'm staying home.

20
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,460
You're supposed to be helping.

21
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,023
Uh... Mer?

22
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:18,434
Maybe there'll be a horrible accident
nearby the hospital.

23
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:21,599
Cut a bunch of people open.
Sternotomies, craniotomies.

24
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:24,973
- That'd be fun, right?
- I don't care about surgeries.

25
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,938
You have a feeling?

26
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,748
- Yes.
- OK. What kind of feeling?

27
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,814
Like I might die.

28
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,622
Today? Tomorrow? In 50 years?

29
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:43,594
We're all going to die eventually.

30
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,928
- But now, we're late. Let's go.
- Cristina... come on.

31
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,430
OK. This is me being supportive.

32
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,040
- Really?
- Yeah, hey, fine.

33
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,099
I'm totally supportive. Go.

34
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,540
OK. The man I love has a wife.

35
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,949
And then he chooses her over me.

36
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,988
And that wife takes my dog.

37
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:13,922
OK, I gave it to her. But I didn't
mean to, I meant to give it to him.

38
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:17,690
But that does not change the fact
that she's got my McDreamy...

39
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:19,897
and my McDog.

40
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:23,697
She's got my McLife.
And what have I got?

41
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,935
Do you know I can't remember
the last time we kissed?

42
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:33,468
You never think the last time is the
last time. You think there'll be more.

43
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,810
You think you have forever,
but you don't.

44
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,822
Plus my conditioner stopped working
and I think I have brittle bones.

45
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,383
I just...
I just need something to happen.

46
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,386
A sign that things are gonna change.

47
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:54,228
I need a reason to go on.
I need some hope.

48
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,165
And in the absence of hope,

49
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,433
I need to stay in bed
and feel like I might die today.

50
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,669
Whatever. Everybody has problems.

51
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:10,773
Now get your ass out of bed
and get to work! Now! Move, move, move!

52
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,011
What were you saying?

53
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,715
We're good to go.

54
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,998
- Quiet board.
- I know.

55
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,795
- That's a bad sign.
- Don't you think I know that?

56
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:35,037
That's a quiet board.

57
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,203
- Is he in a bad mood?
- Quiet board.

58
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,042
- He hates a quiet board.
- I can hear you talk about me.

59
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,309
- We're saying...
- A quiet board means trouble.

60
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,044
A quiet board is death.

61
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,451
A quiet board bodes bad news.
And stop looking at me like that.

62
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,690
- Dr. Shepherd.
- Dr. Burke...

63
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,621
You and I, we've known
each other for a while now, right?

64
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,394
- Yes.
- Done successful surgeries together?

65
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,233
- Yes.
- Your girlfriend is my ex's friend.

66
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,503
- Yes.
- Can't we use each other's first name?

67
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,434
I don't think so.

68
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:16,244
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

69
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,784
- Dr. Shepherd.
- Dr. Burke.

70
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:24,683
I haven't been in the OR in two days.
I'm getting some OR time.

71
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:28,386
- We haven't had a decent resident.
- The last two weren't that bad.

72
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,793
Doesn't matter which one we get.
They suck.

73
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:34,355
They all sucked. I miss Dr. Bailey.

74
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,028
You all right?

75
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,201
I have a feeling.

76
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,340
I get those.

77
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:49,972
Yeah?

78
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,517
- Yeah.
- And?

79
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:55,110
If you wait long enough, it passes.

80
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,517
Promise?

81
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,817
I promise.

82
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,569
Hey. What are you doing?

83
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:14,037
- Waiting for it to pass.
- For what to pass?

84
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,844
- Do you want to do charts later?
- Never gonna happen.

85
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,173
What?

86
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:23,215
I gave you your chance
and you slept with someone else.

87
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:28,345
I forgave you in the spirit of being
a bigger person, of rising above.

88
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:32,187
But these legs are closed to you now.
The panties are staying on.

89
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:37,161
- So you and me? Never gonna happen.
- So you don't want to do charts later?

90
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,289
- Stand over there.
- Let's get back to the point.

91
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:40,354
- You had a point?
- Yeah.

92
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,924
Which surgeon are we
having to suck up to today?

93
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,334
- That would be me.
- Dr. Bailey?

94
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:49,865
I've been gone two weeks, two weeks,
and you ran off two residents?

95
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:53,935
I've got people phoning me, telling me
my interns are Rosemary's Babies.

96
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:57,278
Nobody wants you.
Do you think I have time for this?

97
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,217
I am pregnant.
I'm supposed to be on bed rest.

98
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,948
I'm growing a human being.
I'm supposed to be calm.

99
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:07,186
Do I look calm to you?
Did I raise you fools to be pariahs?

100
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,790
- You're back.
- I'm not back.

101
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,698
- You're not?
- Get off me.

102
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,835
Yang, Karev, Grey, stay here
and wait for the incoming case.

103
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,937
O'Malley, page Addison Shepherd.
Stevens, get a wheelchair.

104
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,777
- A wheelchair?
- A wheelchair.

105
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,545
- What should I tell Dr. Shepherd?
- What did I say?

106
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:36,577
Dr. Bailey? What should I tell
Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd?

107
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,087
Tell her my contractions
are ten minutes apart

108
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,220
and my water just broke over your shoes.

109
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,634
Just... Boy, get off me!

110
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,364
Take her!

111
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,545
- Dude.
- Yeah.

112
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,358
James Carlson, age 46.

113
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,199
Paramedics found him unconscious.

114
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:29,037
Mechanisms of injury are unknown,
but he has a large sucking chest wound.

115
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,599
- And a wife with very healthy lungs.
- Vitals?

116
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,373
Tachycardic in the 140's,
BP holding in the 90's.

117
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,815
You were gone when I woke up.

118
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:42,514
- Oh, I had to do a thing.
- You didn't leave a note.

119
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:45,751
Yeah, well, I had this thing to do.
I did this thing.

120
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,658
- And once again...
- What?

121
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,958
We go to sleep,
I think everything is fine

122
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,363
and by the time I wake up,
you're just a little bit crazy.

123
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:58,369
- I get... I'm not crazy. I had a thing.
- OK.

124
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:02,497
- How's his respiratory effort?
- Absent breath sounds on the right.

125
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,806
Air bubbling at the wound.
He's shocky and a little cyanotic.

126
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,506
My wife was...

127
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:13,809
Let's get him intubated and place
an occlusive dressing over the wound.

128
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:17,652
- Now, you...
- Hannah. Hannah Davies.

129
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,886
Hannah. Why do you have your hand
inside my patient?

130
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,520
For the record, I told her not to.

131
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,394
I tried to tamponade the wound
with gauze and pressure,

132
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,524
but only my hand
would stop the bleeding.

133
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,092
Every time I move it
he starts bleeding out.

134
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,170
Can I take my hand out now?

135
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:37,676
You don't stick your hand in a patient
when you don't know how he was injured.

136
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,768
- Yeah, I know that now!
- Out of my room.

137
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:43,406
- She gets to stay?
- She has her hand inside my patient.

138
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,312
- Nice. Thanks.
- Well, don't get happy.

139
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,881
You have your finger on a bleeder
and Mr. Carlson is running out of time.

140
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,226
The only thing that you have won
is an all expense paid trip to the OR.

141
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,629
Dr. Grey,
prepare to transport her to the OR.

142
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,033
- Let's do this quickly.
- What do you want me to do?

143
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:08,369
I want you to make that woman stop
screaming and tell us what happened.

144
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,069
- I can't go to the OR?
- No, you have a thing to do.

145
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,104
- What was that about?
- If I'd known you'd get the good case,

146
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,615
I'd have let you stay in bed.

147
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,509
She's been going 20 minutes.
This must be some kind of record.

148
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,749
Look at her. She's not even turning red.

149
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,258
Good for her. Burke says shut her up.

150
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:30,989
We've got an incoming trauma.
MVC with a 30-minute extrication time.

151
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:35,295
Severe intrusion damage to the car.
Definite head injury. Stable vitals.

152
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,733
- Five minutes.
- I got it.

153
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,235
- I got it.
- I called first.

154
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,431
You said Burke told you to shut her up.

155
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,474
No, he told me
to tell you to shut her up.

156
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:46,775
Ma'am. Ma'am.

157
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:52,246
Mrs. Carlson... Are you injured?

158
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,819
I need you to try and calm down.

159
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,789
Mrs. Carlson? Can you hear me?

160
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,120
Can you hear me?

161
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:13,231
Good. OK. Now, can you tell me
exactly what happened to your husband?

162
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,986
- What are you doing?
- Chief. Bailey's in there.

163
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,722
Bailey's back?

164
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,492
- O'Malley!
- She's in labor.

165
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,999
Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd
is examining her cervix.

166
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,626
I can see that quite clearly.

167
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,362
O'Malley, stop looking!

168
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:55,079
Pretty amazing, right?
The miracle of life.

169
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:58,310
Our Bailey. Becoming a mother.

170
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,181
It feels good...

171
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:04,313
having Bailey back at the hospital.
Balance is being restored.

172
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,018
- That's all I'm saying, sir.
- Hey, guys.

173
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,358
Would you give this to Dr. Shepherd?
Thanks. What's going on?

174
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:14,195
- Bailey's in there.
- Oh, Bailey's back? That's excellent.

175
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:18,102
And her cervix
is being examined by my wife

176
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,900
which is a visual
I'll never get out of my head.

177
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,237
Thanks for the warning.

178
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,105
Well...

179
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:31,411
A gathering of men outside the delivery
room. How mid-century of you.

180
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,076
- Say hi to Bailey for me.
- Hm.

181
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,347
- How she doing?
- Taking it like a woman.

182
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,754
Six centimeters dilated,
50 per cent effaced,

183
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:43,056
and refusing pain meds, which I think
is stupid but I'm not in labor, so...

184
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:48,260
- What are you doing out here?
- Can I get you anything?

185
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:51,997
A boy the size of a ten-pound bowling
ball is working his way out of my body.

186
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,266
Can you get me a new vagina?

187
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,205
- Oh. Well...
- I didn't think so.

188
00:12:56,275 --> 00:13:01,212
Look, I appreciate the concern,
but I'm fine. It's just childbirth.

189
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,272
All I need is my husband
who should have been here by now.

190
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:09,015
Write down his number.
I'll call him. I'll track him down.

191
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,649
All right. Then go away.
Give me some privacy.

192
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:16,217
I don't want to see any of you again
until after the baby is born,

193
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,230
which, if he does like I told him to
and stays on schedule,

194
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,129
should be in four-and-a-half hours.

195
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,129
I mean it.

196
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,965
- Bailey's back.
- She's back, sir.

197
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,806
- He's my patient. Get your own.
- I had one. Meredith took him.

198
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,710
- So now you're going to take mine?
- If I can.

199
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:39,274
- Is my wife here? Is she here?
- Was she in the accident with you?

200
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:42,787
- She's supposed to be...
- We'll find her, Mr. Jones.

201
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:46,382
- What have we got?
- Tucker Jones, 35. Flipped his car...

202
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:50,417
He's got a chest contusion and a head CT
shows a depressed skull fracture

203
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,088
and temporal epidural hematoma.

204
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,361
GCS 14 in the field, now down to 12.
His motor exams are intact.

205
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,766
- A gram of Dilantin and 70 of mannitol.
- I'm on it.

206
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,362
Mr. Jones,
I need to do an examination on you.

207
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,804
My phone.

208
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:05,139
It's my wife.
You need to answer. She needs me.

209
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:08,442
OK, we'll answer your phone.
Dr. Stevens, answer his phone.

210
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,846
- I've got it.
- Mr. Jones, squeeze my fingers.

211
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,784
Mr. Jones? Hey, I need you
to squeeze my finger, OK?

212
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,618
He's in a seizure.
Get him on his side. Watch his arm.

213
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,750
Hello? George? What are...

214
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:24,057
- It's me. Izzie.
- Let's get him to the OR.

215
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:28,122
No... I think I'd know if I had
Bailey's husband's phone, George!

216
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,395
Watch his arm, watch his arm.

217
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,632
- What's Bailey's husband's name?
- Watch the wall.

218
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,571
- How are you doing over there?
- My hand's getting numb.

219
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,742
And this whole
"insides are bloody and squishy" thing

220
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,048
is so not good for my gag reflex.

221
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,819
But I'm good.
Is this OK? Me being in here like this?

222
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,986
Once Dr. Burke scrubs in,
he'll have you remove your hand

223
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,689
and then you can go
and we'll fix Mr. Carlson.

224
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,096
Good. I know how much medicine I know

225
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,726
and it's just enough
to never be allowed in an OR.

226
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:07,401
It's my second week as a paramedic.

227
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,067
I got out of school about a month ago.

228
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:12,770
I haven't been doing this
that long either.

229
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,814
Talk about on-the-job training, huh?

230
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:27,951
- Dr. Burke.
- Dr. Shepherd.

231
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,354
You got Dr. Bailey's husband
on the table?

232
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,763
Bailey's husband is going into surgery?

233
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,196
Got into a car accident
trying to get to the hospital.

234
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,862
- What do we tell her?
- Nothing.

235
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,397
Wait until I see how bad the damage is.
Have something concrete to say.

236
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,308
Yeah, no use upsetting her
until we know.

237
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,039
- OK, keep me posted.
- OK.

238
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:51,014
- Hey, Preston.
- Good seeing you, Addison.

239
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,308
What?

240
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,581
She gets to call you by your first name?

241
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,589
- I like her.
- And you don't like me?

242
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,215
No.

243
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,761
- How are we doing?
- He's stabilized.

244
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,827
- I'm just about to put him under.
- Doctor?

245
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,480
You're... Shepherd, right?

246
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,575
- Yes. I am.
- I thought so.

247
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:32,782
Miranda... she really likes you.

248
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,188
I like her too.

249
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,321
We're having a baby.

250
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,963
I know. I'm gonna take care of you.

251
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,634
I'm going to get you back to Bailey,
safe and sound.

252
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,869
All this blood and none of it's hers?

253
00:16:55,881 --> 00:17:00,113
No, she's fine. Acute anxiety reaction.
Give her two diazepam PO to calm her.

254
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,551
- She in shock?
- I'll say.

255
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,917
Can you tell us exactly what happened?

256
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:10,894
You mean the shock part?
It was shocking. I'm shocked.

257
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:14,160
You tell my husband when I get my hands
on him, he's a dead man.

258
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:18,465
- Do you hear me? Scaring me like this.
- Exactly how was your husband injured?

259
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:23,065
- Mindy? Mindy, you in here?
- I'm over here! You moron!

260
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:28,040
- How's James doing?
- Oh, he's bleeding all over the place.

261
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:31,674
The girl in the ambulance put her hand
inside him, that's how he's doing!

262
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,014
- What are you yelling at me for?
- Because!

263
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:37,055
You and James are idiots!
Playing like eight-year-olds.

264
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,987
We don't play. We reenact.

265
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:43,222
You play. You put on costumes, you build
your stupid toys and you play!

266
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:46,196
- We reenact.
- Nobody reenacts World War II!

267
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,665
- You moron!
- Exactly what happened?

268
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,602
What happened is my husband
and his moron best friend...

269
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:56,107
- Can you stop calling me a moron?
- Moron best friend

270
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,302
decided to build some kind of big gun.

271
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:02,814
Yeah, an exact replica of the finest
Allied antitank weapon of World War Il:

272
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,280
the M9A1 bazooka.

273
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:08,285
So they put on their stupid costumes
and they go out into the backyard

274
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,116
and they try to shoot the thing!

275
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:14,387
I'm the gunner. James is the loader.
We followed the specifications exactly.

276
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,725
It's a 60 millimeter,
1.5 pound rocket. It's a beauty.

277
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,390
It didn't work. So, like an idiot,

278
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:24,766
my husband has to go and stand in front
of his big gun to see what went wrong.

279
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:27,601
That's when the stupid toy
starts working.

280
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:31,905
- Stop calling it a toy.
- I'll call it whatever I want!

281
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:34,969
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
He shot himself with a bazooka?

282
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:38,778
- Yeah.
- He shot himself with the bazooka?

283
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:42,309
- Like I said, morons, the pair of them!
- Was there an explosion?

284
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,321
- Huh?
- Was there an explosion?

285
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:45,447
No. Why?

286
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,292
Oh, crap.

287
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:51,988
What?

288
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,665
What is it?

289
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,435
Hey! Slow down.

290
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:11,142
If Bailey asks,
I'm not the one who did this.

291
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:27,829
OK. I'm going to do a thoracotomy and
Hannah is going to pull her hand out.

292
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,893
Dr. Grey is going to clamp the bleeder
when we have more exposure.

293
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,034
- Ready?
- More than ready.

294
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,597
Scalpel.

295
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,712
Tucker Jones...

296
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:52,780
you'd better be lying
in the street somewhere dead, mister,

297
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,656
because when I get my hands on you...

298
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,719
I am having your baby here, mister!

299
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,530
OK. On the count of three. One...

300
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:08,461
Two...

301
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,745
Dr. Burke?

302
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,814
I need to speak with you.

303
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,341
- I am in surgery, Karev.
- You want to talk to me, sir.

304
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:31,651
Unhook me.

305
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,705
If you interrupt me,
it better be for a...

306
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,967
- Was it through and through?
- What?

307
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,134
The wound. Was it through and through?

308
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,576
No. There's just an entry, no exit. Why?

309
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,110
He's cute. He single?

310
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,801
- Hannah.
- Yes, Dr. Burke?

311
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:19,970
What do you feel inside of Mr. Carlson?
What is your hand touching?

312
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,104
What do you mean?

313
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,445
Is your hand touching anything hard?

314
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,951
- Hard?
- Like metal.

315
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:32,089
Um... I don't know.

316
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:36,025
Don't move your hand.
Just tell me what you feel.

317
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:38,324
Dr. Burke, what's going on?

318
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,659
Hannah?

319
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:44,998
Um, my fingertips are touching
something... kinda hard.

320
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,335
Yeah, definitely.

321
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,567
- Oh, my God.
- Dr. Milton.

322
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,235
What? What's wrong?

323
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,439
Hannah, I don't want you to move.
Not your hand.

324
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,506
Not your body. Not an inch.

325
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,780
OK. You should know
you're starting to scare me.

326
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:05,016
Don't be scared.
Everything's going to be fine.

327
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,081
Dr. Grey, can you...

328
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,295
I want you to walk out of this room.

329
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,600
Walk, do not run.

330
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:25,233
Go and tell the charge nurse
that we have a Code Black.

331
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,140
I'm sorry. Code Black?

332
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:32,581
Code Black. Tell him that I am sure.

333
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,814
And then tell him
to call the bomb squad.

334
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,689
What did she stick
her hand in there for anyway?

335
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:52,430
- She was trying to save his life.
- And now she might die because of it.

336
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,069
What do we do now?

337
00:22:56,141 --> 00:23:01,340
I go back in and wait for the bomb
squad. You leave. You all leave.

338
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,510
Mer, you coming?

339
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,719
It's your funeral.

340
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,054
You need a surgical team.

341
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:15,560
All I need is Dr. Milton to keep him
under. I can do the rest myself.

342
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,598
Fine. But you wait by the elevator.

343
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:30,937
I don't want anyone in here
that doesn't need to be in this OR.

344
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,842
When the bomb squad arrives,
we'll take it from there.

345
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:37,905
Until then, Milton and I
are doing this alone. Now, go.

346
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,355
OK, OK, OK.

347
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,327
Ah!

348
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,024
Eight minutes apart.

349
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,727
There is no shame in an epidural,
Miranda.

350
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:59,703
Epidural increases
the possibility of a C-section.

351
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,398
It also decreases pain.

352
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:04,101
Miranda, this is a big baby,
it is your first baby

353
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:06,644
and it is not going to be
a short or an easy labor.

354
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:09,339
I can handle a little pain. No problem.

355
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:12,781
Women all over the world do this at home

356
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:16,218
with nothing more than a pair
of scissors and a bucket of hot water.

357
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,724
Women all over the world also die
giving birth at home every day.

358
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,759
I did not just say that.

359
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:28,766
You're supposed
to be finding my husband.

360
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,961
- Well, I...
- He's not here.

361
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,066
He should be here by now.

362
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,802
OK, we're gonna go find him.
Right, Dr. O'Malley?

363
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:40,367
Right. I'm...

364
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,141
What?

365
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:48,013
Oh, nothing. I'll be right back.

366
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,918
Yang, could you check that?

367
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:01,760
- How's he doing?
- Oh, it's touch and go.

368
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,961
I'm just trying
to find the source of the bleeding.

369
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:08,528
Go and find Addison. Tell her
he's in worse shape than I thought.

370
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:15,342
- What'd they want?
- They want us to evacuate.

371
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,678
- Evacuate? Did they say why?
- Your pager said, "Code Black".

372
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,779
- You're sure they said that?
- Yes.

373
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:27,223
It could be a drill.

374
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:30,625
I can't evacuate.
I've got an open brain on the table.

375
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:35,829
I'm not leaving Bailey's husband
with his skull flap open

376
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:38,131
so if anybody wants to go,
they should go.

377
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:43,197
Anybody want to evacuate?
Going once, going twice, three times.

378
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:50,079
- You're sure they said, "Code Black"?
- Yes.

379
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,217
I don't like
having to lie to Dr. Bailey.

380
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:58,484
- Now is not the time, Dr. O'Malley.
- She'd want to know...

381
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,822
She'd want to know about her husband.

382
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:06,987
- Code Black? What's a Code Black?
- Wait, hold it! Whoa!

383
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,965
Dr. Shepherd wanted me to tell you

384
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,867
that Tucker's bleed is more extensive
than he thought.

385
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,735
It will be a few hours
before he has anything concrete.

386
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,467
Thanks, Stevens.

387
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,070
- What's a Code Black?
- A what?

388
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:23,942
Code Black?

389
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:26,711
Code Red, Blue, White...
I've never had a Black.

390
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:27,877
Dr. Shepherd?

391
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:32,890
Just go to your locker room and wait for
your resident to give you instructions.

392
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,892
- We have no resident.
- What's goin' on?

393
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,951
Is it something bad?

394
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,535
Yeah. It's something bad.

395
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,504
So...

396
00:26:56,581 --> 00:27:00,881
So I'm touching
live unexploded ammunition?

397
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,451
I'm afraid so.

398
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,854
Not the greatest feeling in the world.

399
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:12,658
No. I guess not.

400
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:19,130
- And... he's still out?
- Yeah.

401
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,229
But he's not hooked up to the machine.

402
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,831
I had Dr. Milton
take him off the ventilator.

403
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:25,899
The flow of oxygen posed a danger.

404
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:30,377
The Ambu bag is breathing for him now.

405
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,477
But he can't hear me?

406
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:34,950
No.

407
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,320
Hannah?

408
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,262
What if I just take my hand out
really quickly?

409
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,637
We'd have to ask the bomb squad that
when they arrive.

410
00:27:56,708 --> 00:28:00,337
But I'm guessing that would
cause the ammo to shift and explode.

411
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:05,381
Oh.

412
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:20,288
- Hannah?
- Yeah?

413
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,960
Your hand is keeping Mr. Carlson
from bleeding out.

414
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,339
You are keeping him alive.

415
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,539
Right. And the bomb squad is coming?

416
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:36,910
The bomb squad is coming.

417
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,144
OK.

418
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:42,444
OK.

419
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:55,096
We're moving
pre-op patients to Mercy West,

420
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,896
all trauma rerouted
to Seattle Presbyterian.

421
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:01,234
There is no danger
to the north, south and west wings.

422
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,365
Just the east surgical wing.

423
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:06,103
That said, anyone
who wants to leave can leave.

424
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:09,578
No one stays unless
they volunteer to stay. Understood?

425
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:11,774
OK.

426
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,411
- Richard. Is it Code Black? Really?
- Yes. I shut down the ORs.

427
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,387
- What? To trauma?
- To everything.

428
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:19,320
To "everything" everything?

429
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:23,190
Ten minutes ago, all operating rooms
at Seattle Grace were evacuated,

430
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,320
with the exception of Dr. Burke's team.

431
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,159
And Dr. Shepherd's team.

432
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:31,135
What?
What do you mean Dr. Shepherd's team?

433
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:32,635
They're still in OR Two.

434
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:36,196
- Bomb squad just arrived.
- Excuse me.

435
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,471
- You're the surgical team?
- Yes.

436
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:45,277
Dylan Young, bomb squad. Check
the area, then we'll secure the patient.

437
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,341
- Where are they?
- In there.

438
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,318
- This floor's been evacuated?
- Yes.

439
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:53,050
You stay here.
Nobody moves unless I say so.

440
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,327
We got people over here!

441
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:01,594
- You said the floor had been evacuated.
- I thought it had.

442
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:04,226
Cristina! No, she will hurt him.

443
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,135
- What's going on?
- A bomb in a body cavity.

444
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:13,276
Man. All I got
is Bailey's husband's open brain.

445
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,278
- What procedure?
- Craniotomy.

446
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:17,576
Shepherd's got Bailey's husband
on the table?

447
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,947
Excuse me? Excuse me! Stop talking!

448
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,230
Got to eat something.

449
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,938
You knew Meredith and Cristina
would be on the floor with the bomb.

450
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:48,001
- Yeah.
- Is it wrong that we're jealous?

451
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,547
The fact that we're jealous
that they might die

452
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,549
is not a reflection on our character.

453
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:55,518
- It's about feeling useless.
- Ineffectual.

454
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,215
We couldn't even
get Meredith out of bed.

455
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:02,191
We had to call in Cristina.
How embarrassing is that?

456
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:07,061
You know what I think, George?
I think Meredith and Cristina are doers.

457
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:09,691
They do. They're doers.

458
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,758
They do. And we...

459
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:15,162
We watch.

460
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:18,405
We're watchers.

461
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:24,676
Check on Mrs. Carlson's levels.
If they're stable she can come up here.

462
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,717
All right. Excuse me.

463
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:31,888
We have to become more proactive,
George. We have to become doers.

464
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,492
Fight for what we want.

465
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,426
- We have to do.
- Yeah.

466
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,699
Oh. You mean...

467
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:44,394
We are starting right now! OK.

468
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,005
Alex.

469
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:52,042
How crazy is this?
Dude, it's like the apocalypse.

470
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,510
- Alex...
- It's true. Look around you.

471
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,548
Half the people supposed
to be saving lives have fled.

472
00:31:57,615 --> 00:32:00,175
Bailey's husband almost died
coming to see his kid get born.

473
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:04,051
The annoying twins are with a guy
who might explode in their faces.

474
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:07,614
It's a morgue. People should
get while the getting's good.

475
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:09,557
- There might be no tomorrow...
- Alex!

476
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:11,026
What?

477
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,795
- Take off your pants.
- What are you doing?

478
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:24,205
Being a doer. Getting while the
getting's good. Take off your pants.

479
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,369
I meant apocalypse metaphorically,
not literally.

480
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,910
Alex...

481
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:33,212
I haven't had sex
in eight months and twelve days.

482
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,309
I'm horny, half-naked and saying yes.

483
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:38,913
You wanna talk metaphors
or do you wanna take off your pants?

484
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:48,131
Sponge.

485
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:51,100
Dr. Shepherd,
there's an explosive device next door.

486
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:54,605
- I need you to evacuate now.
- I've got a guy whose brain is exposed.

487
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:56,435
I'm not going to leave him to die.

488
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,302
The rest of you can go.

489
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:03,176
You should go. Suction.

490
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:24,692
You close him up.
You do whatever you have to do.

491
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:28,330
The chief of surgery has authorized
me to tell you you cannot stay.

492
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:31,466
The chief of surgery doesn't scare me.
Dr. Bailey scares me.

493
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:34,511
I'm not going to be the one
to let her husband die.

494
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:38,538
And that's what would happen if I
put his skull flap on in this condition.

495
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:41,779
Bomb or no bomb. Now, get out of my OR.

496
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:45,517
Suction.

497
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,957
Trying to get gravity to do me a favor.

498
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,698
I'm nine centimeters dilated.
I need that last centimeter.

499
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:04,765
Good. That's uh... That's good.

500
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,180
Dr. Shepherd?

501
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:19,518
Where... exactly... is my husband?

502
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,889
He's with my husband.

503
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:35,272
Oh.

504
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:40,738
There is no telling how dangerous it is.
We need more info.

505
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:46,674
The longer we wait, the greater
the chance he'll bleed out and die.

506
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,986
Pink mist.

507
00:34:57,995 --> 00:34:59,394
Excuse me?

508
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,695
That's what the bomb squad calls you
when you blow up.

509
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:10,371
Pink mist. I read that somewhere.

510
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:18,749
Bomb goes off and... anyone in range
explodes into a billion pieces.

511
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,777
You're liquid. There's nothing left.

512
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:27,457
Just flecks of human flesh and blood.

513
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,592
Pink mist.

514
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,697
Sometimes they don't even find a finger.

515
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:40,233
One minute, you're a person...

516
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:45,438
the next, you're... bloody rain.

517
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,414
Here. Take this.

518
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,217
- What?
- Go ahead.

519
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:04,521
Now I want you to squeeze it
in even beats.

520
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,825
OK, no, not too fast. Not too fast.

521
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:10,894
There you go.

522
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,841
Dr. Milton?

523
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,349
I've got kids.

524
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:38,486
Even beats.

525
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,087
OK?

526
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,335
That's it.

527
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:06,615
What about my husband?

528
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:09,990
How long can he stay like that?
With live ammo inside him?

529
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,827
- I honestly don't know.
- But you're gonna try to save him?

530
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:18,699
We're gonna try. The bomb squad has
to determine how to retrieve the device.

531
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,703
I'm sorry, Mindy. I'm so sorry.

532
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:25,731
Shut up! We've got three kids
and you've got him building bazookas?

533
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,342
Oh, God...

534
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,519
He's gonna die.

535
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,112
Paul, why don't you go
with the officer there

536
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,886
and answer his questions
about the device?

537
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:44,257
- Anything to help.
- Oh, Karev...

538
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:47,525
Why don't we get Mrs. Carlson
a cup of coffee?

539
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,658
I guess I should look
on the bright side.

540
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,762
It's not like this can get any worse.

541
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,397
I mean, this is it.

542
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:01,743
This is as bad as it gets. Right?

543
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,054
Dr. Bailey? Uh, I was...

544
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:16,492
Someone find me my suitcase.
I need my suitcase. I'm going home.

545
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,460
Dr. Bailey, you're having a baby.

546
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:22,556
There's not going to be any baby born
today! You hear me? I'm holding it in!

547
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,567
I'll have him tomorrow.

548
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,570
Just not now. Not like this. No!

549
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:31,404
Just... no.

550
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:34,870
I'm going home.
I'm going home right now!

551
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,274
I can't...

552
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,381
I can't do this without my husband.

553
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,283
I can't do this alone.

554
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,325
OK, OK, OK.

555
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:06,769
So how are they going to remove that
ammo without killing Hannah and James?

556
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:14,350
Cristina! The bomb squad guys said you
were supposed to stay away from there.

557
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:15,976
Is it me or is Hannah shaking?

558
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,224
- Is she squeezing that Ambu bag?
- Where is Dr. Milton?

559
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:30,656
Hannah?

560
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,700
- Where's the anesthesiologist?
- He, um...

561
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,473
He left.

562
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,635
He didn't want to die.

563
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:46,610
Hannah?

564
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,852
I think I'm gonna take my hand out now.

565
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,023
When the hell are people gonna learn?

566
00:39:57,094 --> 00:40:02,031
- It may not be as bad as it seems.
- Her hand is holding the device steady.

567
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:07,735
Or maybe her hand is simply in there
with the ammo. We can't know.

568
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,363
My guys talked to the friend.

569
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,898
That device is homemade which means
it's unstable and unreliable.

570
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,138
It could be a dud
but we have no way of knowing.

571
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,942
Add that you've got a surgeon
next door refusing to leave

572
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:20,916
and a nervous paramedic's hand
inside the body cavity.

573
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:24,182
It's... definitely as bad as it seems.

574
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,280
That's what I'm saying.

575
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,222
Hey, somebody help!

576
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,260
Help here!

577
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:34,388
- I'm just going to take it out now. OK?
- You can do this.

578
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:37,400
No, no. No, I just want to take it out
and be done with it.

579
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,766
Hannah. It won't be much longer.

580
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,397
- You're keeping him from bleeding out.
- No.

581
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:46,910
I am 22 years old. I should not even be
in here. This is some kind of mistake.

582
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:49,377
- We need to clear the room.
- I'm not leaving.

583
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,142
- Grey.
- I'm not leaving her.

584
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:54,241
- Get everyone out now.
- She's my intern.

585
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,116
- I am responsible for her.
- No, it has to come out.

586
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,156
- Yang, go with Dylan.
- You go with Dylan.

587
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:03,159
- Hannah, look at me.
- No, it's got to come out. No, no.

588
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,388
Hannah, look at me. You can do this.

589
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:09,456
Hannah, calm down. You need
to relax and everything's gonna be fine.

590
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,660
- No!
- Hannah.

591
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:14,602
- You can do this, Hannah.
- It has to come out!

592
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:17,800
No, will you keep it there
just a little while longer? Hanna...

593
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,240
I have to!

594
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:48,595
Meredith.

595
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,240
What did I do? Oh, God.

596
00:41:57,448 --> 00:42:01,145
Just stay where you are.
Nobody move. Stay exactly where you are.

597
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:02,378
Meredith?

598
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:15,994
What did I do? What did I do? What
did I do? What did I do? What did I do?

599
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,832
What did I do?

600
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:24,333
What did I do? What did I do?
What did I do?
