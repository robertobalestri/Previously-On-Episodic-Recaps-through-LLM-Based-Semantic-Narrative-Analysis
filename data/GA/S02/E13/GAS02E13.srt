<i>Previously on Grey's</i> Anatomy<i>:</i>

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,630
Meredith wasn't a fling.
I fell in love with her.

3
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:09,197
Yeah, it's my mother.
She has Alzheimer's.

4
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:11,573
Have you even told Burke about the baby?

5
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:12,702
I had a right to know.

6
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,542
I failed the medical boards.

7
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:15,808
That's embarrassing.

8
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:18,442
I'm pregnant, you blind moron.

9
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,315
Can we please just talk?

10
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,480
You're too busy screwing nurses to talk.

11
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:24,352
I never wanted to hurt you.

12
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,324
I think we'd be better off with dogs.

13
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,208
God! Holy... Ow!

14
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:47,712
I said, down! Back! Izzie!

15
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,477
Izzie! Incoming!

16
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:57,919
<i> Fresh starts. Thanks to</i>
<i>the calendar, they happen every year.</i>

17
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,459
<i>Just set your watch to January.</i>

18
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:02,586
I'm thinking about coloring my hair.

19
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:05,995
- Maybe red.
- Yeah. Red's good.

20
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:10,901
- I'm thinking about cutting mine.
- Yeah? You look good shorter.

21
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,460
- You think?
- Yeah.

22
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:17,306
He's such a good dog.
Who's a good boy? He's a good boy.

23
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,107
What a good dog.
Who's Mommy's good boy?

24
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:25,350
Silly. Yes, I know. You're a good boy.
You're such a good boy.

25
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,909
What are you guys doing?
We're gonna be late.

26
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,387
- We need to talk about the dog.
- That's no dog.

27
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,482
It's a hyena dressed in dog clothing.

28
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:37,223
I don't chew his clothes, urinate on his
bed or try to mount him from behind.

29
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:40,892
People, he's our dog.
We love our dog. He loves us.

30
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:55,805
- He tries to mount you from behind?
- Tries to. He tries to.

31
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:07,091
<i> Our reward for surviving</i>
<i>the holiday season is a new year.</i>

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,254
<i>Bringing on the great tradition</i>
<i>of New Year's resolutions.</i>

33
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,763
I got a trout.

34
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,790
- Oh!
- Rainbow trout.

35
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,666
- Why bring a trout into the house?
- It's a trailer.

36
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:20,262
Why bring a rainbow trout
into the trailer?

37
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,534
Breakfast.

38
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:22,973
- Breakfast.
- Hungry?

39
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,272
- For trout?
- Yeah.

40
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,346
I hate this, Derek.

41
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,605
Ah!

42
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,616
I hate this. Hate! Hate!

43
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:34,016
I hate this trailer.

44
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,679
So no trout for you then?

45
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:39,247
<i> Put your past</i>
<i>behind you and start over.</i>

46
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,624
I'm standing there
with Pritchard and Lewis,

47
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:47,655
and they keep on asking me who I was
with in the on-call room last night.

48
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,760
They heard us. Were we that loud?

49
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,729
- You're loud.
- Stop.

50
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,103
I am loud, aren't I?

51
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:01,546
Pritch. Was always sticking his nose
in someone else's business.

52
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:05,710
You know I actually saw him again,
at his wife's funeral?

53
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,549
What? Pritchard isn't married.

54
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:14,622
Uh... Oh, right, right. I'm thinking
of someone else. Just confused.

55
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:18,926
You need sleep.
Residency is wearing you down.

56
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,163
- Ellis?
- Yes?

57
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:36,071
Nothing. I just hate being an intern.

58
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,549
Mm. Me too.

59
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,721
<i> It's hard to resist</i>
<i>the chance at a new beginning.</i>

60
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:46,122
<i>A chance to put the problems</i>
<i>of last year to bed.</i>

61
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:51,687
Mmm.

62
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:56,565
- So in the name of the New Year...
- I don't do resolutions.

63
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,900
In the name of the New Year,

64
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:03,068
I thought you could give me
an answer to my question.

65
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:07,408
- Your question?
- About you... moving in.

66
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,947
I don't have an answer.

67
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:14,180
- Cristina...
- I'm not being Cristina. I just...

68
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,916
I don't have an answer.

69
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,185
Then answer me this.

70
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,285
- What were you planning to do?
- About what?

71
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,421
The baby.

72
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,465
Dr. Burke? We're ready for you.

73
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:41,504
Listen up, people.
New year, new rules.

74
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:45,278
Or should I say, new year,
and we will be enforcing the rules

75
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,047
mandated by the
Residency Review Committee.

76
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:52,490
There were too many mistakes made last
year. Fatigue played too big a role.

77
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,789
Exceeding 80 hours work per week
will not be tolerated.

78
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:59,389
- Does that mean we get to have a life?
- I think so.

79
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:03,265
Sullivan. You were on call for 28 hours.
Leave when you hit 30.

80
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,134
Grey, you were here until two.
See you at noon.

81
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:10,539
- I get to go? Free time?
- Run before he changes his mind.

82
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,240
Our nurses are gonna have to work extra
hours to compensate, so treat them well.

83
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,842
- Cranky nurses don't do us any good.
- Well, maybe you can cheer them up.

84
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:24,545
You know what? My New Year's resolution
was to let it go, and I am.

85
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:27,422
I have. I've let it go. I apologize.

86
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,654
- You do?
- I do.

87
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,290
- How did your test go?
- Good, but I won't know for a few days.

88
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,266
- We're all pulling for you.
- We are?

89
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,461
We are.

90
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:41,935
You can see the mesothelioma better
now that I've partially dissected it.

91
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,608
Um, I can't...

92
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,147
I can't see it from here.
Can I go in closer?

93
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:50,910
You're fine there.

94
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:55,049
Preston, good news.
We have a heart for Denny Duquette.

95
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,919
- Has he been called?
- Got here ten minutes ago.

96
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,515
I was worried we couldn't
find a match in time.

97
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:04,290
We have a plane to take you to Twin
Falls, Idaho for the organ recovery.

98
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,800
90 minutes each way.
How much more do you have here?

99
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,859
The heart comes out first.
I'd be cutting it too close.

100
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,428
They have
a local heart team there, so...

101
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,201
No. Bailey. Send Bailey.

102
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,640
She'll be our eyes.

103
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,113
- Dr. Yang, you need to leave this OR.
- Excuse me?

104
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,172
You've exceeded your 80-hour limit.

105
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,481
- You have to leave the hospital.
- OK. Um... Um...

106
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,953
As soon as the mesothelioma
is dissected...

107
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,047
Dr. Yang. Now.

108
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,686
You heard him.

109
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:45,232
- Denny Duquette.
- Hey, Dr. Bailey.

110
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,966
I hope seeing you here
means they found you a heart.

111
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,838
No offense, doctor,
but I'm not a big fan of hospitals.

112
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,378
It takes something special
to get me in here.

113
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,778
What do we know about Mr. Duquette?

114
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:59,716
Capricorn, single,
loves to travel and cook...

115
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,277
Denny, be quiet. Let her show off.

116
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,688
Denny Duquette, 36,
admitted today for a heart transplant

117
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:09,558
- necessitated by viral cardiomyopathy.
- And what does that mean?

118
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,097
His heart can't fill
and pump blood normally.

119
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:16,329
Good. Denny, this is Dr. Stevens. She'll
be tending to you prior to surgery.

120
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,303
So I guess I'll be seeing you around,
Dr. Stevens.

121
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,899
<i>Dr. Vale, 2743. Dr. Vale, 2743.</i>

122
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:26,342
Trying to get some action
when he's practically a corpse.

123
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,640
He was just being nice.

124
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:30,773
No one enforced an 80-hour work week
when I was an intern.

125
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:35,412
110, 120 hours suited me just fine.
I learned more 'cause I worked more.

126
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,615
You get a rest
before you have the baby.

127
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,387
- Being pregnant, keeping up the pace...
- You saying I look tired?

128
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,793
No. Not tired. No.

129
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,457
You look... fresh, spry.

130
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,591
You glow. What? You...

131
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:49,726
Stop now.

132
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:53,135
O'Malley, go do an intake
on Addison Shepherd's patient.

133
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,730
Addison.

134
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,606
- You do glow.
- Like the moon.

135
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,409
And you can spend
the day in the pit, Karev.

136
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,287
Dr. O'Malley.

137
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,558
Hi. Mr. and Mrs. Singleton, Rebecca,
this is Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd.

138
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:22,089
You don't think it's cancer?
Bex is too young for cancer, right?

139
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,137
I'm just getting up to speed. I'm sorry.
Dr. O'Malley?

140
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,866
- Rebecca's...
- Could you stop calling me that?

141
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,000
She prefers Bex. Not Rebecca.

142
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,639
Bex has been admitted
for an ultrasound guided

143
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,512
biopsy on an enlargement
of a pelvic lymph node.

144
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:41,576
- OK. Bex, you mind if I check it out?
- OK. I'll just, um...

145
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,117
It's a minor procedure, Bex,

146
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:49,025
but we'll give you a local anesthetic
to manage the pain.

147
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,556
What are you drawing?

148
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,967
- Just a dumb comic.
- You're really talented.

149
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:03,735
It's big. I know.
It just appeared one day.

150
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:07,506
I'll perform a biopsy this morning,
and Dr. O'Malley will take blood

151
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:12,017
so we can run some tests, and then we
can start to get you some answers. OK?

152
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:15,645
No need to panic. I'll keep you posted
every step of the way.

153
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,780
- Thank you.
- OK.

154
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:23,389
Sorry about this, but I'm going to need
that arm to get some blood.

155
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,020
I'll be quick.

156
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,478
Mr. Paskowitz. We've located
the source of your abdominal pain.

157
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:46,713
- There. It's called a bezoar.
- Bezoar, huh?

158
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:50,313
Foreign matter that couldn't
be expelled with a prokinetic agent.

159
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:54,689
I love it. In a hospital
a laxative is a "prokinetic agent".

160
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,287
- You just go up his butt and grab it?
- Baby. Please.

161
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:02,266
We won't be able to reach it that way.
We'll have to get it from here.

162
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,067
So, Mauer, tell me
what you have been eating?

163
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,902
Garbage. Absolute garbage.

164
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,136
Could you be more specific?

165
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,909
Tell him what you ate, Mauer.

166
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,544
He's a writer.

167
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,022
- Suffering for his art.
- OK.

168
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:30,389
- He ate his novel.
- I'm sorry, what?

169
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,364
I ate my novel, OK?
The whole damn thing.

170
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,234
Every last piece
of that unmitigated crap.

171
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,805
- The labs for Bex Singleton.
- Anything?

172
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:23,246
Her hormone levels, estrogen,
progesterone, are sky-high.

173
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,773
Huh. You did a history, right?
Any mention of birth control pills?

174
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:30,310
- No. But her parents were right there.
- Talk to her again.

175
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,857
She hasn't hit puberty.
She would be having sex?

176
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:36,952
These days, Dr. O'Malley, it's not
that unusual. Talk to the patient.

177
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,925
- Derek.
- Morning, Richard.

178
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,060
- You busy?
- No, my surgery just got canceled. Why?

179
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,434
- I need a favor.
- Sure.

180
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,877
Hey, Bex.

181
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,412
Your mom and dad...

182
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,710
- Food.
- Great.

183
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:03,986
Because I wanted to talk to you.
Your lab... The work...

184
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,022
Have you been taking
birth control pills?

185
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,995
- If you tell my mom and dad...
- No, I won't.

186
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,091
I just need to know why.

187
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,965
Do you have a boyfriend or...

188
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:21,438
Like anybody would
want to have sex with me.

189
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,498
Well, then why?

190
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:26,710
I'm as flat as a board.

191
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:31,045
I took like five of those pills a day,
and nothing's different.

192
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,850
Boobs, dude.

193
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,946
You... were trying to
make your breasts grow?

194
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:41,823
I wanted to be normal
for once in my life.

195
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,759
- Did this cause the tumor?
- No.

196
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:46,855
The pill wouldn't have
any effect on your lymph nodes.

197
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,924
The amount that you were taking
is really dangerous.

198
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:53,096
And it caused a pretty major
hormonal imbalance.

199
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:58,108
- Have you been feeling different?
- I feel like I always feel.

200
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,977
- Hi.
- Hi.

201
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,482
- You leaving?
- 80-hour limit.

202
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:14,754
- You?
- Surgery was postponed.

203
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,222
- I have a dog.
- You have a dog?

204
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,292
- My point is, I have a dog.
- You have a dog.

205
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,235
Oh, you know what? I love dogs.

206
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,172
I've moved on,
so don't give me that look.

207
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,642
What look?

208
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:36,374
- That look. Our look. I'm over you.
- I'm over you too.

209
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:37,915
- You are?
- No.

210
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,679
Oh. Well, I am.

211
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,748
Over you.

212
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:48,260
- I'm over you too.
- You just said... Shut up.

213
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,032
- Hi.
- Bye.

214
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,844
There is a land
called Passive-Aggressiva

215
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,511
- and you are their queen.
- I am fine.

216
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:17,579
- Except when you shriek about trout.
- I was not.

217
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:21,422
- You were shrieking about Meredith.
- I was shrieking about the trailer.

218
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,859
- Last three weeks have been about that?
- Yes.

219
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,193
- Not about saying I love Meredith?
- "Loved."

220
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,130
- What?
- You said "loved." Past tense.

221
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,690
Yes, past tense.

222
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,828
Well, then I have been
shrieking about the trailer.

223
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,879
Mauer, time to return your book
to the library. Surgery is in an hour.

224
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,179
- What's this sweat?
- Probably nerves.

225
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:49,915
But I'm sweating like Nixon.
President Richard Milhous Nixon.

226
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,890
That guy could sweat.
And I, Mauer Paskowitz,

227
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,121
I wrote an epically crap novel,
but I can sweat like Nixon.

228
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:59,255
It's not even that bad.
I read practically every draft.

229
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,765
Forgive me,
but you are not Lionel Trilling.

230
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,495
- It blows.
- Lionel Trilling?

231
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,730
He seeks the approval of dead critics.

232
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,170
- The dead don't read.
- Ever think about being

233
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,174
- something other than a writer?
- No.

234
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,939
I am a writer. Mauer Paskowitz.
I have no plan B.

235
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,846
We can't marry for three years
until the book is done.

236
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:21,114
Three years I listen to him piss and
moan for what? So he can eat the thing?

237
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:24,087
- Ha!
- Your computer have a "delete" button?

238
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:27,523
I wanted to literally put it
behind me and start a new book.

239
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,892
OK, we all get the symbolism.
It's painfully obvious.

240
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,397
And obviously painful.

241
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,926
All set, Dr. Bailey.

242
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,836
<i> Dr. Marshall to OR 2.</i>
<i>Dr. Marshall to OR 2.</i>

243
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:46,344
Hey. Hi. I heard you were going
to Twin Falls, Idaho. I've never been.

244
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,870
- You reached 80 hours?
- Technically.

245
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,941
You're off work, Cristina.
Go enjoy your day.

246
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:57,250
No, I'll enjoy my day if I can
help retrieve a heart. I promise.

247
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,755
It's a nice coat.

248
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:04,318
- You see that, Dr. O'Malley?
- The tumor is compressing an ovary.

249
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:08,799
Yep.
That's why I biopsied both ovaries.

250
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,267
- Is that bad?
- It's just a precaution, Bex.

251
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,272
- Apply pressure, Dr. O'Malley.
- Mm-hm.

252
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:18,469
I'll get this to path.
Mind doing the dressings?

253
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:19,602
Sure.

254
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:24,411
All right, Bex. Then we'll get you
the results just as soon as possible.

255
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:37,484
You're a doctor.
Haven't you seen scars before?

256
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,724
Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out

257
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:43,598
why someone with so much talent
would want to do that.

258
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,796
It's just a comic book.

259
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,841
It's about me and my best friend Jenn
when we were kids.

260
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,173
- Satisfied?
- Does she write it with you?

261
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,645
Jenn has a boyfriend
like everyone else.

262
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,409
I get to be a freak all by myself.

263
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:02,284
Oh, a freak. That's not the easiest
thing to be in high school, is it?

264
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,879
You sound like my shrink.

265
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,051
Hey, I wasn't always a doctor.
In high school...

266
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,625
...I was secretary and treasurer

267
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,190
of the Dungeons and Dragons club.

268
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,731
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

269
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:22,638
I was also a mathlete, and I won
the blue ribbon in biology club.

270
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,375
Best fetal pig dissection.

271
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:29,141
And let me tell you, that had
the girls knocking down my door.

272
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,447
You just have to
get through high school.

273
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,217
'Cause high school sucks for
anyone who's the least bit different.

274
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,487
But then there's college,
and then out in the real world,

275
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,551
you'll find where you fit in.

276
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,900
- You think so?
- Yeah, I know so.

277
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:02,447
- Hi.
- Denny. I thought you were asleep.

278
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:06,314
Nah, I don't sleep in hospitals.
I'm scared I'll never wake up.

279
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,156
- Can I ask you something personal?
- If I say no?

280
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,993
I'll hold my breath
which will stop my heart, killing me.

281
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:21,532
You're here.
You'll be charged with murder.

282
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,058
Lifetime in prison being loved
by a big old girl named Hilde.

283
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,866
My choices are homicide charges

284
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,840
or inappropriate personal questions
from a patient?

285
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,308
- I know. Kinda sucks.
- Hold your breath.

286
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:35,073
I'll take my chances with Hilde.
I can do girl-on-girl.

287
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:39,846
Oh! See, how can I blackmail you
if you bring up girl-on-girl?

288
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,182
What do you want to know?

289
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:46,691
- That guy Alex... you with him?
- No.

290
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:50,125
- Not anymore. And never, ever again.
- Good.

291
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,356
- Good?
- Yeah. Good.

292
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,729
It means
I won't have to fight him for you.

293
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,098
Why do you think
I want you to fight for me?

294
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,900
- Hello. You are in love with me.
- Am I?

295
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:05,205
Yeah, it's not your fault. I mean,
I'm well-off, but I'm not into money.

296
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,542
I'm smart, but I'm not a know-it-all.
I'm funny.

297
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,879
I'm... I'm really nice. I love animals.

298
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,316
And I'm hot. I'm a catch.

299
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,581
You know, if you can
wrap your head around

300
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:20,022
the enlarged failing heart
and the dependency to IV meds.

301
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,059
You're right. I am so in love with you.

302
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:29,532
It's a shame really.
Since I'm with Hilde and all.

303
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,206
There. Five loads of laundry.

304
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,637
I have literally
washed the past out of my life.

305
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:47,480
<i>Dr. Calls, 2241. Dr. Calls, 2241.</i>

306
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,714
- You paged me?
- Yeah.

307
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:53,349
Have a look at this. It's Bex's biopsy.

308
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,893
- Biopsied ovary?
- Not exactly.

309
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,691
Arrange a meeting
with Bex's parents, George.

310
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,597
Find the psychiatrist,
if they're available.

311
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,430
- Does she have cancer?
- No.

312
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:07,529
- That's not an ovary. It's a testis.
- A testis?

313
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:11,542
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I'm sure.

314
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:16,545
- Bex is a hermaphrodite?
- Yes.

315
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:45,742
Yang? Why are you staring
at my fat pregnant belly?

316
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,335
Sorry. I...

317
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:53,145
Let me get this straight.
You're telling me that our daughter,

318
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:56,585
you're telling me my daughter
might actually be a boy?

319
00:20:56,655 --> 00:21:01,092
That... how is that possible? I don't
understand. I don't understand how...

320
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:05,892
- Shouldn't this have been detected?
- Externally, Bex has female genitalia.

321
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:07,226
She looks like a girl,

322
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:12,202
but internally she has
both female and male sex organs.

323
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:16,264
So, what now? What are we
supposed to do? I don't understand.

324
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:20,539
OK, the best news is
that the lymph node tumor is benign.

325
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,240
So physically,
Bex is going to be just fine,

326
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:27,911
but emotionally, psychologically,
I strongly recommend therapy.

327
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,477
- She's in therapy.
- For all of you.

328
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,921
This is not gonna be
easy for Bex to hear,

329
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:35,960
and it's not gonna be
an easy adjustment for you to make.

330
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,394
- What kind of adjustment?
- My poor girl.

331
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:43,025
Many intersex people begin to
identify very strongly with one sex.

332
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:46,127
And it's not necessarily
the sex they've been raised.

333
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:49,901
She's a girl. She looks like a girl.
She has always been a girl.

334
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,433
This at least helps explain
why she feels so different.

335
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,344
The point is,
biologically and emotionally speaking,

336
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:01,352
- she has a choice to make.
- A choice?

337
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:06,085
My mouth feels all weird.

338
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,388
Chewing paper will have that effect.

339
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,428
- Weird how?
- Pins and needles.

340
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,828
No, needles and pins.
Needles and pins. Yeah, yeah.

341
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,959
Sprouting from my fingers and toes
like... like...

342
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:21,333
- Lord God, give me a simile.
- Is he always this way?

343
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,897
The man ate a novel.
He's not exactly normal.

344
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:27,911
But he got weirder the more he ate.
He's, like, obsessed.

345
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:31,745
I'm Dr. Webber. I'm gonna be
performing your surgery today.

346
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,809
I poured my heart and soul
into that freaking book,

347
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:37,081
and now it's stuck up my ass.

348
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:40,647
Put that on my tombstone, Audrey.
On my tombstone.

349
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:46,625
<i> Dr. Love to OR 2.</i>
<i>Dr. Deb Love to OR 2.</i>

350
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:52,400
- Hey, Dr. Stevens.
- Hey, Denny. You OK?

351
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:55,065
I've been waiting for this a long time,
you know?

352
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,507
You'll open my chest, take my heart
and replace it with another.

353
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:03,139
Well, not me.
And not another heart, a better heart.

354
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,681
What if something goes wrong?

355
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:12,348
Don't be nervous.
Dr. Burke is an incredible surgeon.

356
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:15,450
You're getting a new heart today.
Keep thinking of that.

357
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:18,792
- Yeah. OK.
- Denny.

358
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:22,300
Preston Burke.
My favorite cardiothoracic surgeon.

359
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:25,359
Your only cardiothoracic surgeon,
but thanks.

360
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:28,998
I'll be on the phone with Dr. Bailey
during the organ recovery.

361
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,440
We want to make sure
the heart stays viable,

362
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,377
isn't damaged while
the other organs are perfused.

363
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,914
We'll have you in the OR,
and if it is a go,

364
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:40,383
we start the procedure
before she even gets back.

365
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,387
- Hey, Izzie.
- Yeah?

366
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,548
I'm getting a new heart.

367
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,383
You're getting a new heart.

368
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,498
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

369
00:23:58,336 --> 00:23:59,735
Excuse me.

370
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,238
Uh...

371
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:05,902
Mary and I were talking,
and we think Bex should stay...

372
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,036
She can't handle something like this.

373
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,877
- You saw the scars.
- You're not gonna tell her?

374
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,211
But this could help her.

375
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,912
- You can't not tell her who she is.
- Dr. O'Malley.

376
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,716
We'll proceed with surgery
to remove the tumor.

377
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,349
You can talk to your daughter
in your own time.

378
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,484
Actually, we were thinking...

379
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:25,962
We thought, since you're
already going to be in there...

380
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,331
We know "fixed"
isn't the right word but...

381
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:32,495
We thought that
with the hormonal confusion,

382
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:35,631
it might be easier on her
to remove whatever boy parts she has.

383
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:39,374
- Keep her more of a girl.
- You're asking me to perform

384
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:41,435
sexual reassignment surgery on her?

385
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,481
- Yes.
- Without her knowing?

386
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:47,143
All she's said all her
life is that she wants to be normal.

387
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:51,121
- She doesn't feel normal.
- Why can't we put an end to her agony?

388
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,851
Removing her male sexual organs
may not do that.

389
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:56,450
- It could do the opposite.
- But her hormones...

390
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,826
Can be controlled with oral medication.

391
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,626
We just want the best for Bex.

392
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:04,100
To do surgery
and alter her body permanently is...

393
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,502
I would not do that on someone
who's unaware of the procedure,

394
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:10,939
and you're gonna be hard-pressed
to find a surgeon who will.

395
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:16,703
Bex will learn the truth some day.

396
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:19,215
How do you want her to find out?

397
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:23,020
Excuse me.

398
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,688
- Meredith. Hi.
- Hi.

399
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:34,357
I had the morning off,
so I came to see my mother.

400
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,525
- She's in the sitting room.
- Thanks.

401
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:40,093
She's in good spirits.
Visitors really cheer her up.

402
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:41,832
Visitors?

403
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,317
What are you doing here?

404
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,721
There is a clinical trial
to study early-onset Alzheimer's.

405
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,691
OK, me you can screw with.

406
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,251
My mother? No. Not acceptable.

407
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,889
Similar studies
have had promising results.

408
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:11,265
- Your mother is a prime candidate.
- She is sick and has few good days.

409
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:14,328
I don't want her poked and prodded
for some experiment.

410
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,897
- I'm just trying to help.
- What you're doing?

411
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,205
Being dreamy? It doesn't help.

412
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:21,711
It hurts me. It messes with my head.

413
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,873
- I know the feeling.
- I don't doubt that.

414
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,247
But you have a wife to go home to.

415
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:29,116
And I'm guessing she has
no idea where you are right now.

416
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:33,754
- No, she doesn't.
- That's what I thought.

417
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,897
- Dr. Bailey?
- Thanks. Dr. Burke?

418
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,597
<i> What are we looking at?</i>

419
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:50,573
The donor is on 25 mics of dopamine.

420
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,439
25 mics? That's too much.

421
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:56,378
They started him on five mics of
dobutamine 30 minutes prior to arrival.

422
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,110
Are they trying to kill my heart?
What is the CVP?

423
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:00,776
- CVP?
- Around ten.

424
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:02,012
- Ten.
- MAP close to 80.

425
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:04,521
- <i> Mean arterial pressure?</i>
- Close to 80.

426
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:07,683
I can live with a CVP as low as five
and a MAP about 60.

427
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,855
- That heart must be off dobutamine.
- The heart must be off dobutamine.

428
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,093
And tell them to get the dopamine
back down to ten mics.

429
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:19,500
Get them to get
another two units of blood.

430
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,898
- We a go, doc?
- Still no final word.

431
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,169
I want the healthiest heart I can find.

432
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:28,178
Dr. Stevens,
you'll be in there with us, right?

433
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,147
Yeah. I'll be in there with you.

434
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,947
<i> All right,</i>
<i>we're going to remove...</i>

435
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:40,253
Aren't you supposed
to be having free time?

436
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,658
Oh, I did five loads of laundry,
cut my split ends, studied,

437
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:46,788
cleaned out the fridge. Free time sucks.

438
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:52,699
When would have been the right time
to hear about your boyfriend's wife?

439
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,501
- OK, are you mad at me or something?
- No. No.

440
00:27:56,574 --> 00:28:00,476
Sorry. I have this patient, and I get
that there's a right and a wrong time

441
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:04,037
to hear big news, but wouldn't you
rather know sooner than later?

442
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:07,107
I mean, just so you can move forward
one way or the other.

443
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,119
I mean, it's a fresh start, right?

444
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:12,818
See the little white line
of Toldt?

445
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:16,349
Now we can mobilize the lateral border
of the left colon. Clamp.

446
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,259
When Leo Tolstoy here wakes up

447
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:21,321
you might get him
to revisit the idea of a new vocation.

448
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:25,358
- He was pretty against the idea.
- Hopefully it was just delirium.

449
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:28,406
If it's all right, I'd like to
keep an eye on him post-op.

450
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:32,068
- He was acting strange.
- He ate a novel. Clearly, he's strange.

451
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,941
It's just,
I don't want to overlook anything.

452
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:38,540
Seriously, Karev. I'm short-handed
all over the hospital.

453
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,584
OK, here we go.

454
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,687
Anybody here tempted to read this?

455
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,325
No takers?

456
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,922
Could be the great American novel.
We'll never know.

457
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,159
He needs a plan B.

458
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,202
He's not the only one.

459
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:00,328
You don't think you passed?

460
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:04,273
- I thought I passed the first time.
- Well, let's wait and see.

461
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:07,243
Right now, today, you're still here.

462
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:12,774
Did you tell my parents about the pill?

463
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:15,081
No.

464
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:18,247
Am I gonna die?
Is that what no one wants to tell me?

465
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:21,759
- Of course not.
- Then why are my parents acting so...

466
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,785
Will you just tell me what's going on?

467
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,956
We're prepping you for surgery

468
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:30,933
to remove the lymph node tumor
that's compressing your...

469
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:32,629
Ovary.

470
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:39,267
Hey, Bex. How are you doing?

471
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,539
Mom, Dad,
this is really freaking me out.

472
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,946
- Oh, no. Everything's gonna be fine.
- It's OK, sweetie.

473
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:49,646
I'm having surgery to remove
a tumor that's compressing my ovary.

474
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,848
Right, George?

475
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:55,349
Dr. O'Malley.

476
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,162
George?

477
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:05,325
- What, am I supposed to lie to her?
- OK. That's enough.

478
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,735
- Please leave the room.
- No. Wait.

479
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,206
Tell me what's wrong with me.

480
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,573
What is wrong with me?

481
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:18,640
Bex...

482
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,149
We learned that your tumor...

483
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,280
it's not compressing an ovary.

484
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,347
Then where is it?

485
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:31,254
It's on a testis.

486
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,328
Like a testicle?

487
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,860
- I have testicles?
- Yes. One.

488
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:41,770
Bex, this is a tremendous
amount of information...

489
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,831
And I've had it my whole life?

490
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,443
Oh, my God.

491
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,777
Does this mean...?

492
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,182
Does this mean I could be a boy?

493
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:03,954
Yes.

494
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:09,392
You engineered that conversation.
Forced our hand.

495
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:10,456
You were lying.

496
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,765
- Protecting her.
- She's a 14-year-old girl.

497
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,498
Maybe. Maybe not.

498
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:19,407
This isn't your life.
This isn't your child!

499
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:23,072
Fourteen years. Fourteen years,
we have raised a daughter.

500
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:26,844
In one afternoon, you expect us to...
What? What is Bex to do?

501
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:31,252
How is she supposed to go home and tell
the other kids? What? You had no right.

502
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,313
No. I know. I'm off the case, right?

503
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:40,292
Whoa, Mauer. Mauer.

504
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:44,324
Lay back. You just had surgery.
You're losing your shirt, man.

505
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,701
Much obliged...
Much obliged, pal.

506
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:49,433
How you feeling?

507
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,839
What's whacked for 20, Alex?

508
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,707
Weeds whacked weeds.

509
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:56,110
Weeds whacked for 200.

510
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,081
Way, way whacked.

511
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,015
- I saw Ellis.
- And?

512
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:04,316
I think I can get her into the trial.
She's a perfect candidate.

513
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:06,880
Excellent. Thank you, Derek.

514
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,256
It requires
Meredith's power of attorney.

515
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:10,692
Yeah.

516
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:14,198
Might be better if it comes from you.
With me, there's baggage.

517
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,132
You? You're just trying
to help out a friend.

518
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:20,230
Right.

519
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,569
Let me know if Meredith
wants me to call.

520
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,006
<i>Dr. Boyd to CTU. Dr. Boyd to CTU.</i>

521
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:29,079
Karev? What are you doing?

522
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:32,913
- Research on the bezoar patient.
- I told you I needed you on the floor.

523
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:36,385
He has fever, sweats, tingling lips,
fingers, toes, mood swings,

524
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,321
lack of coordination
and did I mention the crazy talk?

525
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,790
- Your point?
- My point is, he ate his novel.

526
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:43,724
- I know.
- Mercury is in the paper.

527
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,786
He's got mercury poisoning.

528
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:51,730
Cristina, call Burke.

529
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:55,864
I'm feeling some fairly extensive damage
from coronary artery disease.

530
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,669
Um...

531
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,505
Yang?

532
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:07,345
- Talk to me, Bailey.
- <i> It's me.</i>

533
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:10,512
I can't talk.
I'm waiting on a call from Bailey.

534
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:13,022
I'm with Bailey.

535
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:14,991
You're in Idaho?

536
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,722
- Yeah.
- <i>You're breaking the rules.</i>

537
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,127
Yes.

538
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:23,759
Preston.
What's happening with our heart?

539
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:28,033
Hello, Dr. Webber. Tell me what I need
to know about Denny's heart, Dr. Bailey.

540
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:51,862
Thank you.

541
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:55,262
This program Derek looked into
was a favor to me.

542
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,967
- Nice try.
- Sometimes a favor is just a favor.

543
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,702
This treatment won't cure your mother
or give her a new lease on life,

544
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:07,574
but it may give her more good days.

545
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,909
I urge you to consider.

546
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:18,011
Lying here trapped in this flesh prison,
I've reached a grim conclusion.

547
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,558
I'm a failure.

548
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:24,595
- You know how that feels?
- Dude, if you only knew.

549
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:28,928
Even my manic attempt to put
my failed novel behind me failed.

550
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,491
Time for a plan B, I reckon.

551
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,367
Time indeed.

552
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,999
Perhaps I shall play the cello.

553
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:41,478
Well, we make a mistake here,
and people die. Happens all the time.

554
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,779
- All the time?
- There's a lot.

555
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,875
Is this part of the hallucination?

556
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:52,685
My point is we all have setbacks, Mauer.
But I'm a doctor, and you're a writer.

557
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,520
We don't have a plan B.

558
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,952
Call security.

559
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:01,931
Have you determined a course
of treatment for the mercury poisoning?

560
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:06,299
The patient has been administered
a chelator called British Antileukocyte

561
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:10,204
which will absorb the mercury
over the next several days.

562
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,299
Good work, doctor.

563
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,391
Yang.

564
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:43,203
Know what's wrong with having
an 80-hour limit? It protects the weak.

565
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:47,267
It levels the playing field.
Which not only sucks, it's dangerous.

566
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:50,576
Eighty-hour work week?
That's what's on your mind?

567
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,212
I thought about it.

568
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:03,925
- Not keeping it.
- You did?

569
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,726
My husband and I, we tried for years.

570
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:11,029
But still,
when that stick turned blue...

571
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,967
You can't work the way we work,

572
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:16,063
you can't want
the kind of careers that we want

573
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,041
and not take... pause.

574
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,771
I took pause.

575
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:25,145
- You paused?
- I paused. I paused a very long time.

576
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,451
So why did...?

577
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:38,895
I sat up one night,
middle of the night...

578
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,760
and I knew I could do this.

579
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:52,542
I still don't know how I'm gonna
do this, but... I knew I could do it.

580
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,611
You just have to know.

581
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:02,085
And when you don't know,
then no one can fault you for it.

582
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:08,719
You do what you can,
when you can, while you can.

583
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:12,527
And when you can't, you can't.

584
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:25,304
- You're stalking me. You're a stalker.
- Well, can you blame me?

585
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,446
So it's bad?

586
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,075
- You have time.
- Liar.

587
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:39,418
- Fine. There's no time.
- Now, that's just spiteful.

588
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,853
I didn't get the heart?

589
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,289
You didn't get the heart.

590
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,308
- Hey.
- Hey, George.

591
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:08,648
Hey, I just...
I just wanted to check in on you.

592
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:11,987
Heard my parents
weren't too happy with you.

593
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,785
Nope.

594
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:19,426
Thanks for telling me.
For making them tell me.

595
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:25,925
You know, um, there are people
that you can talk to.

596
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:28,494
- I can...
- I know.

597
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:35,837
- George, do I have to be a boy now?
- No.

598
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:41,243
- No.
- But I can if I want to?

599
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,981
Yeah, you can. If you want.

600
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,584
Hey, could you...?

601
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,923
Would you bring me some scissors?

602
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,227
<i> Who gets to determine</i>
<i>when the old ends and the new begins?</i>

603
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,562
Derek.

604
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,199
- Hi.
- Tell me about the program.

605
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:08,939
<i>It's not a day on a calendar,</i>
<i>not a birthday, not a new year.</i>

606
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:13,016
- Denny. I'll see you.
- Goodbye, Dr. Stevens.

607
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:20,482
- Hey. He's leaving?
- Didn't get the heart.

608
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,048
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

609
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:25,789
- He's a good guy.
- Yeah. He is.

610
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:37,073
<i> It's an event. Big or small.</i>

611
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,200
<i>Something that changes us.</i>

612
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:42,507
<i>Ideally, it gives us hope.</i>

613
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:12,503
<i>A new way of living</i>
<i>and looking at the world.</i>

614
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,274
I'm cooking the trout outside.

615
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:23,353
Thank you.

616
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,819
Oh.

617
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:35,789
There is a land
called Passive-Aggressiva...

618
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,260
- and I am their queen.
- That's all I'm saying.

619
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:46,834
So what? With Meredith...

620
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,412
Am I supposed to just wait it out?
Wait until it passes?

621
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:57,253
That'd be good.

622
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:01,390
I still hate the trailer.

623
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,518
As is your right.

624
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:11,829
<i> Letting go of old habits,</i>
<i>old memories.</i>

625
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:19,768
I wasn't gonna have it. The baby.
And you don't get to be mad about that.

626
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:22,108
We barely knew each other.
I was an intern.

627
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,704
- There was no way...
- I'm not mad.

628
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,420
- You're not?
- No.

629
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:34,651
I just wanted to know.

630
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:39,028
I want to know things.

631
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:42,429
<i> What's important</i>
<i>is that we never stop believing</i>

632
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,297
<i>we can have a new beginning.</i>

633
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:50,173
Doc, that was my laundry.
You don't eat laundry.

634
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:52,766
Bad dog! Bad dog! Bad!

635
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:04,278
<i> But it's also important</i>
<i>to remember that amid all the crap</i>

636
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:08,451
<i>are a few things</i>
<i>really worth holding on to.</i>
