<i>Previously on Grey's Anatomy:</i>

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,160
If anyone should be celibate,
it's Meredith.

3
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:07,172
I'm Finn Dandridge. I'm Doc's vet.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,969
I'm off men. No more men.

5
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:10,338
You brought the baby to work?

6
00:00:10,409 --> 00:00:13,572
I'm covered in mommy.
But I will not be mommy tracked.

7
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:15,045
You're his doctor, Izzie,

8
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:18,242
and he's your half-dead,
possibly soon to be all-dead, patient.

9
00:00:18,317 --> 00:00:21,616
You should see them.
They're running and cooking and talking.

10
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:22,847
They're bonding.

11
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:25,516
George O'Malley is sweet and kind.

12
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:27,491
- You live here?
- I'm not crazy.

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,824
I just spend so much time here
in the hospital.

14
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:32,420
Holy crap. George is her McDreamy.

15
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:42,905
<i>The key to being
a successful intern is what we give up.</i>

16
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:46,274
<i>Sleep, friends, a normal life.</i>

17
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:51,083
<i>We sacrifice it all
for that one amazing moment.</i>

18
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:57,380
<i>That moment when you can
legally call yourself a surgeon.</i>

19
00:00:57,456 --> 00:00:59,651
Thank you.

20
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:01,625
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

21
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:02,991
Thanks.

22
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:06,793
<i>There are days that make the sacrifices
seem worthwhile.</i>

23
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:11,428
Oh, my God. You're thanking me
for the most boring sex ever?

24
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:15,497
I didn't know what else to say.
I mean, you did your best.

25
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:18,543
Oh, great. Thanks. You too.
It's really nice work.

26
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,704
We used to be
really good at this, didn't we?

27
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,908
We're going to do this
until we get it right. Ow! Jeez!

28
00:01:26,852 --> 00:01:28,114
- Perfect. Ow!
- Hospital.

29
00:01:28,187 --> 00:01:32,783
Hello? Hi. No, no, no, no. No.
It's about Doc.

30
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:35,383
Yeah. No, I'm here.

31
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:38,396
Yeah, I can pick him up this morning.
Sure. Bye. No. Come on.

32
00:01:38,464 --> 00:01:40,557
Dr. Dandridge. Dr. Dandridge. I...

33
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:44,729
We'll call you back. We're trying really
hard to have some decent sex here.

34
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:47,170
<i>Come on. What's so funny?</i>

35
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:52,336
<i>And then there are the days
where everything feels like a sacrifice.</i>

36
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:57,048
- Everything OK?
- Yeah. Everything's great.

37
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:01,512
Hey, Doc. You look good. He looks good.

38
00:02:01,587 --> 00:02:06,217
It may just be a virus. But I'd like
to wait for the blood tests to be sure.

39
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,159
So he can go home today?
Derek says he can pick him up.

40
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:12,322
- He can go home.
- You hear that, Doc? You can go home.

41
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:17,499
So you and Derek, uh... you're together?

42
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,038
Uh...

43
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:23,041
Uh, Derek and I are, um, just friends.

44
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,407
He's married and I'm knitting a sweater.

45
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:30,914
And, uh, well, I guess I'm rambling,
which I tend to do a lot of lately,

46
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:33,747
and I wish somebody
would just tell me to shut up.

47
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:37,846
But my point is... yeah, we're... uh...

48
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:40,619
He's married and I'm knitting a sweater.

49
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:43,059
- So you're single?
- Single.

50
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,394
I ask because I was wondering
if you'd like to go out with me.

51
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:49,366
- Out. With you.
- On a date. Tonight.

52
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,902
A date. Tonight.

53
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,963
And you're repeating everything I say
so that you can buy yourself some time

54
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,635
and figure out how a way
to let me down easy. It's OK. I get it.

55
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,508
No. No. I... I... um...

56
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:04,845
you know, you're very...
It's just that if I were, you would...

57
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,617
Not dating.

58
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:13,715
<i>Then there are the sacrifices that you
can't even figure out why you're making.</i>

59
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:19,896
Another day, and once again
I don't see my name on the board.

60
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:23,696
Chief, any reason
my name isn't on the board?

61
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:28,368
Slow day.

62
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,432
He just patted me on the back.

63
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:34,036
Tell me, when did I become a person
who gets patted on the back?

64
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,377
You think he's mommy tracking you?

65
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,813
What... What have you heard?

66
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:42,683
How about you handle Denny Duquette
for me today?

67
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:45,383
Absolutely. Thank you, Dr. Burke.

68
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:51,722
- I brought you a coffee.
- Oh, thanks. Uh, very thoughtful.

69
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,024
- What?
- Nothing. I'm just dragging a little.

70
00:03:57,102 --> 00:04:01,095
Only did two miles this morning.
O'Malley and I were up to six.

71
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:05,075
- Oh, you're missing George.
- No. No, of course not.

72
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:07,305
- Drink your coffee.
- No, that's all right.

73
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,744
- Actually...
- Cappuccino!

74
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:10,611
Hey, O'Malley!

75
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:16,714
Big news. Eugene Foote is here.
He's having problems with his pacemaker.

76
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,053
- Here? What? In this hospital?
- Uh-huh.

77
00:04:19,124 --> 00:04:20,751
Who's Eugene Foote?

78
00:04:20,826 --> 00:04:22,987
Genius violinist? Burke's hero?

79
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,792
Burke flew down to San Francisco
to put in his pacemaker.

80
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,459
- Burke has 40 of his albums.
- No. Um, 42.

81
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:31,560
No, 43. You just got the greatest hits.
The one with the DVD.

82
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:34,538
- Oh! Right. You want in on Foote?
- Yes.

83
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,098
But, uh, I'm on neuro today
with Dr. Shepherd.

84
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:43,908
I want in! Hello! I want in!

85
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,247
Hmm? Oh. Sure. Yeah, right.

86
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:51,153
Burke? Um, I laid on top of you
naked last night.

87
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:53,953
So why don't you wax nostalgic
about that?

88
00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:00,096
Obviously, I can't
go out with him, right?

89
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:01,996
Do I look like a chick to you?

90
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:05,093
Do I look like I care about yeast cream
or tingling feelings?

91
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:09,106
I mean, he's not in jail or on drugs
or keeping body parts in his basement.

92
00:05:09,174 --> 00:05:11,938
- You want to do him, do him.
- Not do him. Date him.

93
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,945
I'm not doing anybody. I'm knitting.

94
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:17,312
I need Eugene Foote's chart.
Oh! Who are we talking about?

95
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:20,784
It's weird, right? I mean,
he's Derek's vet. He's Doc's vet.

96
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:24,949
He's my vet. He's McVet.
It's weird to date him, right?

97
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,288
- Wait, did you say vet?
- Mm-hmm.

98
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:31,227
Like animals? Oh, you can't date a vet.
He's not even a real doctor.

99
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:32,730
Damn it!

100
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:38,327
Sex. Hot sex. Need that!
Ha-ha, very funny.

101
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:41,373
- Mustn't have gone well this morning.
- What?

102
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,374
Just run if she looks at you.

103
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:45,535
I need an intern. Now.

104
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:47,374
- I'm with Bailey.
- I'm with Burke.

105
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:49,471
Karev.

106
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:52,312
I don't do vagina.
Not as a doctor anyway.

107
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:56,081
Oh. Back talk. You know what?
You just bought yourself a case.

108
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,623
- How are you feeling today, Denny?
- Great.

109
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,455
Be even greater
if you'd get me off this machine.

110
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,826
Denny, you know I would,
but then your heart would stop beating,

111
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,991
and Dr. Burke would yell at me
and that'd be a bad day for both of us.

112
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,160
Is he a candidate for the portable LVAD?

113
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:13,966
Now, see? That's what I'm talking about.
Half the size, twice the fun.

114
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,507
- You been doing your research, huh?
- I have.

115
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,907
I've already told him,
he's not ready for it yet.

116
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,674
Dr. Stevens, didn't I assign you
to neuro this morning?

117
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:26,741
Yeah. I was... I'm on my way. But could
you tell him about the complications?

118
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,712
You'd be risking air embolus, v-fib.

119
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:32,950
The tubing could kink
inside your body,

120
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,459
and we'd have to rush you
to emergency surgery.

121
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:38,928
Dr. Stevens, unless Mr. Duquette's heart
has suddenly grown a brain,

122
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:41,796
- you are currently not doing your job.
- I'm going.

123
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:45,598
- Just don't be stupid, OK?
- You're not the boss of me now, woman.

124
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:51,765
- I want you to take it out.
- Take it out?

125
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:57,106
But your heart function has improved
exponentially since we put it in.

126
00:06:57,182 --> 00:07:00,640
- The setting is working well.
- You know my music, Dr. Burke.

127
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:03,210
Very well, sir. Changed my life.

128
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:06,155
Well, your contraption
has changed my heartbeat.

129
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,125
It changed my rhythm. I can't play.

130
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:11,162
And that's a sacrifice
I am unwilling to make.

131
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,394
But you'd be willing to sacrifice
your life for your music?

132
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:17,628
They're one and the same.

133
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,797
Before we do anything drastic,

134
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,433
just let me try one more setting
on the pacemaker.

135
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:27,969
Listen, one more setting, Mr. Foote.

136
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:29,978
Please.

137
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:36,115
OK, sure.

138
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,653
- Hello, Wards.
- Hi.

139
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:46,562
We're just waiting on your labs.
How you feeling?

140
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,361
I'm feeling large.

141
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,800
- Large and cow-like.
- Cow?

142
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:54,305
Mommy is a cow
who needs a quiet talk with the doctor.

143
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,206
- Hey, guys. Who wants ice cream?
- Me! Me!

144
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:04,338
CBC and CHEM-7 look fine.

145
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,054
Rose?

146
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:13,187
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:13,258 --> 00:08:14,850
I'm so tired.

148
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,157
Well, you know,
six kids, 38 weeks pregnant.

149
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:21,563
- A saint would be tired.
- Well... I'm no saint.

150
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:26,862
This baby, Joseph...

151
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,702
Dr. Shepherd, I need him to be my last.

152
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:34,769
And I really seem to be
the most fertile woman on the planet.

153
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,577
If you're interested
in other forms of birth control...

154
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:40,550
No. What I mean is...

155
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,648
today, during the C-section,
I need you to tie my tubes.

156
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:51,759
And I need you to do it
without my husband ever knowing.

157
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:13,209
Rose, you're an adult. He's your
husband, not your legal guardian.

158
00:09:13,285 --> 00:09:15,310
Telling him would be entirely up to you.

159
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:17,855
No, if you charged my insurance
he would see it.

160
00:09:17,923 --> 00:09:19,754
Any bill you sent, he would see it.

161
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:22,885
I've been saving for this
and I can pay you privately.

162
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:26,624
So you're saying you want me to do the
surgery and leave no record of it?

163
00:09:26,698 --> 00:09:30,259
Mrs. Ward, if you're being abused,
there are people you can talk to.

164
00:09:30,335 --> 00:09:34,465
Oh. Chris is...
He's the opposite of abusive.

165
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,941
If we pull up your medical records
we won't find broken bones or...

166
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,639
If you pull up my medical records,
you'll find three natural child births,

167
00:09:41,713 --> 00:09:44,648
three C-sections,
two hospital stays for exhaustion,

168
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:48,743
and one for dehydration because
I was so busy chasing my kids around

169
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,984
I forgot to take a sip of water
for three days.

170
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:55,117
I think God understands
what I'm going through.

171
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:58,152
And I think God will forgive me.

172
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,757
But Chris... For him,
religion isn't like a buffet table

173
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:05,065
where you get to choose what
you want to take and leave the rest.

174
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:10,040
And the Pope says no to birth control,
so... I need your help.

175
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:12,633
You don't need our help.
He's not abusing you.

176
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:15,339
And you don't get to lie to him
and blame it on the Pope.

177
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,839
Dr. Karev.

178
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:22,512
No offense, but I have no interest
in obstetrics or gynecology.

179
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:25,386
So if you want to throw me off the case,
feel free.

180
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:29,860
<i>Dr. Karev,
I may be a board-certified OBIG YN</i>

181
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:32,761
but I also have fellowships
in maternal-fetal medicine

182
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,025
and medical genetics

183
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:37,500
and I'm one of the foremost
neonatal surgeons in this country.

184
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:40,197
When you can top that,
you can mouth off.

185
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:43,400
Until then, you will do your job
and you will do it right,

186
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:46,444
which at this point in time
means you keep your mouth shut

187
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:49,446
unless I give you permission to open it.
Understood?

188
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:53,547
- Understood?
- Oh, are you giving me permission now?

189
00:10:56,855 --> 00:10:58,447
Good morning, Ms. Graber.

190
00:10:58,523 --> 00:11:01,924
Oh, really? "Good morning?" You haven't
let me sleep in three nights.

191
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,191
This hat is destroying my self-esteem
and I haven't had a seizure.

192
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:08,165
But we'll go with "Good morning"
if it makes you feel better.

193
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:10,895
Ms. Graber is here for brain-mapping.
Dr. Stevens?

194
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:13,437
Brain mapping is where you locate
the area of the brain

195
00:11:13,505 --> 00:11:17,236
where the seizures originate and remove
it with minimal damage to tissue.

196
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,367
Excellent.

197
00:11:18,443 --> 00:11:22,140
Except for the fact that it's not
working, and I'm losing billable hours.

198
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,842
Unless any of you are looking
to get out of a bad marriage?

199
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:27,747
- No.
- Dr. Shepherd?

200
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:30,515
Yes. No. I'm fine, thank you.

201
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:31,578
- Really?
- Yes.

202
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,716
- I'm a good divorce attorney.
- I'm sure.

203
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,760
And there was a look.
Between these two.

204
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:38,091
- A look?
- No. No look.

205
00:11:38,163 --> 00:11:41,428
What is it? You married young
and now you have nothing in common?

206
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,127
Oh, no, don't tell me. I know.

207
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:46,227
The conversation is still good
but the sex has gone to pot.

208
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,967
Make her seize? How do we
make someone have a seizure?

209
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,474
Get creative.

210
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:54,103
If all the normal methods have failed,
then... what are we supposed to do?

211
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:56,170
Use a strobe light. Get her drunk.

212
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:59,115
Hang her from the ceiling
and hit her with a Wiffle Ball bat.

213
00:11:59,184 --> 00:12:01,379
Make her seize.
I don't know where to operate.

214
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:03,421
That means I can't get her
out of my life.

215
00:12:03,488 --> 00:12:06,480
And this woman
is not how I like to start my mornings.

216
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,531
I'm just curious, George.
Curious George.

217
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:19,968
Get it?

218
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,599
Never mind.
All I'm asking is where you live.

219
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:27,702
There's an old-school arcade game
that's been known to induce seizures

220
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,269
if you reach level 53.

221
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:32,784
Our divorce lawyer is so not playing
an arcade game for 53 levels.

222
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:35,547
Oh, George, by the way,
um, where do you live?

223
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,147
I'm busy doctoring, Dr. Stevens.
No time for chitchat.

224
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:42,690
Morning, Dr. O'Malley.

225
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,964
Uh... morning, Dr. Torres.

226
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:52,067
Hmm. So, guess what.

227
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,303
Yes.

228
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,347
Dr. O'Malley,
how's all the doctoring going?

229
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,965
You tell me.

230
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,766
It's an honor to hear you play.

231
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,035
Too good a man to lie.

232
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:36,242
I'll read your mind: His timing is off.
His rhythm is off.

233
00:13:36,314 --> 00:13:40,614
This man has no business
calling himself Eugene Foote.

234
00:13:41,753 --> 00:13:46,747
You understand, sir, that in the months
since the initial surgery,

235
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,589
scar tissue has formed
around the pacemaker.

236
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:54,688
Removing it is not nearly
as simple as it sounds.

237
00:13:57,402 --> 00:13:59,893
I picked up the violin at six years old.

238
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:03,139
It was in my grandfather's attic.

239
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,233
I didn't even know what it was.

240
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:08,370
But I remember picking it up.

241
00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:11,505
That moment.

242
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:17,916
I remember putting the bow
to the strings and pulling.

243
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,560
Just that.

244
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:29,464
Just that screechy little chirp.

245
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:32,059
And that was it. I was hooked.

246
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,639
You remember a moment like that
in your life?

247
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:43,578
I know this surgery could kill me.

248
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:46,417
I also know you're the best,

249
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:50,421
which makes you
my best shot of survival.

250
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:54,255
I'd like you to be the one to operate,
Dr. Burke.

251
00:14:56,094 --> 00:15:00,554
But if you won't,
I'll find someone who will.

252
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,436
He's right.

253
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,534
What? He can't play?

254
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:15,011
He can't play like Eugene Foote.

255
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,105
OK. So, uh, surgery?

256
00:15:17,849 --> 00:15:21,182
He says he will go somewhere else
if I refuse. I might let him.

257
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,244
Why?

258
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:28,290
Oh, you can't let him
go somewhere else. What are you?

259
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,826
OK, what if it were you?

260
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:40,298
What if you couldn't
be a surgeon anymore?

261
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:44,365
Or... Or you could still be one,
but... but not a great one.

262
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:48,173
Just average. He can get his surgery
somewhere else.

263
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:51,745
But that surgeon might be average.

264
00:15:56,655 --> 00:16:02,389
EKG, ECHO, and nuclear
all within normal limits.

265
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:07,227
Denny, in that case, I see no reason
why you can't be up walking.

266
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,202
- Music to my ears, Dr. Bailey.
- Good. So, you have any questions?

267
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,330
- No. It's...
- We can put it off.

268
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:19,707
No harm in waiting a few weeks if
you have questions. If you're worried.

269
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,576
I've got 20 tubes coming out of my body,

270
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:25,616
one of which goes directly
into my you-know-what.

271
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:28,517
At some point I'd like to use
that you-know-what

272
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,817
for something besides peeing into a bag.

273
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,414
Like, for instance,
peeing into a toilet.

274
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:36,892
It's just...

275
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,123
Izzie gave me medical advice.

276
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:41,188
You're giving me different advice.

277
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:45,202
It just so happens that yours
is the advice I want to hear.

278
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,602
Well, Dr. Bailey outranks Dr. Stevens.

279
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:52,405
So, it's safe to say Dr. Bailey's advice
is the one to follow.

280
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:54,843
That's not what he's worried about,
Dr. Grey.

281
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:58,679
He's worried that Dr. Stevens
might get her ego bruised

282
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,911
and her feelings hurt, am I right?

283
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,146
No, no. Definitely no.

284
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:07,123
It would concern me
if you were making medical decisions

285
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:10,320
based on how
our Dr. Stevens might feel about it.

286
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:12,920
Well, in that case,
I say we do this thing.

287
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,398
Screw that dizzy blonde doctor girl.

288
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,264
That's not helping, Denny.

289
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:19,132
- No?
- No.

290
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:23,031
What's going on
between Stevens and Denny?

291
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,440
Is it a crush?
Is it an innocent flirtation?

292
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,410
Or is Stevens crossing the line?

293
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:30,573
I know she likes him.
I can't imagine Izzie would do that.

294
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:31,775
Uh-huh.

295
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,684
I couldn't imagine you and Yang'd be so
stupid as to fall for your attendings,

296
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,222
but I was wrong about that, wasn't I?

297
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,520
I'm knitting these days.

298
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,060
Plus, I may accept a date
with a veterinarian.

299
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,926
Grey. Do you actually believe I care?

300
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:50,093
- No.
- Good. Maybe you're not so stupid.

301
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:58,742
Explain one more time
exactly what this is supposed to do.

302
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,641
Having the TV this close

303
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:04,478
makes the flickering and flashing
more intense, which can cause seizures.

304
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:08,576
Oh. Normally I don't have time to watch
TV, but this week I've discovered Oprah.

305
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:12,749
She's famous in my business for
never marrying that boyfriend of hers.

306
00:18:12,824 --> 00:18:15,315
Wise, wise woman.

307
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:25,992
You won't say where you live and now
I'm on the outside of your inside jokes.

308
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,699
- When did I end up on the outside?
- You're not.

309
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:31,571
- Now you're lying. To my face.
- You're being paranoid.

310
00:18:32,243 --> 00:18:36,509
Well, I'm not seizing. But I am having
an acid flashback. Does that count?

311
00:18:40,485 --> 00:18:44,421
Rose... Seven kids... It's a lot.

312
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,625
Are you sure that Chris
isn't feeling the same way?

313
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:52,459
When we were first married, we were
so broke that I went on the pill.

314
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,761
Chris stopped taking Communion.
When he does that, he thinks he's...

315
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:59,099
Thinks he's going to hell.
He thinks you're both going to hell.

316
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:03,974
The reason we haven't had a baby
in four years

317
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,340
is because we abstained for three.

318
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:09,869
Now can you imagine not being able
to make love to your husband?

319
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,444
Um... the, uh... pill...

320
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:17,010
I can't hide the pill.
He would find out.

321
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:21,525
If he found out, what? I mean, he won't
divorce you. He doesn't believe in it.

322
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:25,120
- See the way he's looking at me?
- Dr. Karev was just leaving.

323
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:28,165
No, no, no.
Just... just look at him for a minute.

324
00:19:31,002 --> 00:19:32,993
That look he has on his face,

325
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:36,632
that's how my husband would look at me
if he knew about any of this.

326
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,973
And I can't have my husband
look at me like that.

327
00:19:42,113 --> 00:19:45,048
And I can't have any more babies.

328
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,548
For the record? I am on your side today.
George sucks.

329
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,596
Hmm. Burke doesn't think so.
He's his new best friend.

330
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:00,688
I wonder if Burke knows where he lives.

331
00:20:00,765 --> 00:20:03,996
How's Denny doing? Bailey's not
caving in on the LVAD thing, is she?

332
00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:05,092
About that...

333
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,697
I thought Alex was kidding when he
said you dumped him for a heart patient.

334
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:11,105
- Did you dump him for a patient?
- Of course not.

335
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:14,077
Because Denny's a patient.
We can't fall for our patients.

336
00:20:14,145 --> 00:20:15,772
You're falling for a vet.

337
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:19,681
I'm considering the possibility
of maybe having a date with a vet.

338
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,742
That's all I'm saying.

339
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:26,884
My point is, Bailey's on the warpath
about you and Denny. So just be careful.

340
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:31,395
How's the sponge count, Dr. Karev?

341
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,159
They're all accounted for,
but I see a bleeder here.

342
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:36,757
It's small.
Get the Bovie and cauterize it.

343
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:41,401
- I got it.
- That's good.

344
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:44,636
Uh, there's a little bleeding
near the tube here.

345
00:20:45,276 --> 00:20:47,938
Can you hand me the Bovie, Dr. Karev?

346
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:54,012
I don't see any abnormal bleeding.

347
00:20:54,085 --> 00:20:55,950
Are you the surgeon here?

348
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,215
- No.
- Then give me the Bovie.

349
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:03,659
Give me the Bovie, Dr. Karev.

350
00:21:21,746 --> 00:21:24,909
Hey there, Joseph. Welcome to the world.

351
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,120
Rose, before we bring
your family in to see you,

352
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:37,594
I wanted to let you know that there was
a complication with your surgery.

353
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:45,130
We had some unexpected bleeding that
caused damage to both fallopian tubes.

354
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:48,038
So you're saying?

355
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:51,405
You won't be able to have
any more children.

356
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:56,036
Thank you, Dr. Shepherd.

357
00:21:57,282 --> 00:22:01,184
As I said, it was... a complication.

358
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,111
I understand.

359
00:22:04,188 --> 00:22:06,520
A complication?
That's what you're calling it?

360
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,218
That's what it was.

361
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:10,989
One of the most bizarre
obstetric complications ever.

362
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:16,658
She is our patient.
Our obligation is to her and her only.

363
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,513
- Hey.
- Well, hey.

364
00:22:35,653 --> 00:22:38,679
- Uh, you picked up Doc?
- Yeah. He's home.

365
00:22:38,756 --> 00:22:41,884
- He seems to be doing much better.
- He seems to be doing good.

366
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:49,660
- I'm not laughing at you.
- No.

367
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:53,670
No, it's just, you know,
bad sex isn't really something

368
00:22:53,738 --> 00:22:57,572
that wives want announced
to the dirty ex-mistress.

369
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:01,100
You're not the dirty ex-mistress.
She's your friend. I'm your friend.

370
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,010
We're all... friends.

371
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,515
But you didn't tell her.

372
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,542
No.

373
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,815
How's your day going?

374
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:13,379
- Great.
- Good.

375
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:17,053
The vet asked me if we...

376
00:23:17,128 --> 00:23:19,995
- What? What did he ask you?
- If we were together.

377
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,965
- Uh-huh.
- And I set him straight.

378
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:28,531
- Good day, Meredith.
- You too, Derek.

379
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:33,440
I'm not drinking another espresso.
I can't.

380
00:23:33,511 --> 00:23:36,105
You can. You're the best
divorce attorney in Seattle.

381
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,273
- The best.
- You can kick that espresso's ass.

382
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:40,613
- Kick it.
- Kick it.

383
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,812
Kick it. Kick. Yeah!

384
00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:44,548
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

385
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:47,955
OK, good. So, caffeine's for seizures.
What's the doughnuts for?

386
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:51,792
To absorb some of the coffee so
it doesn't burn a hole in your stomach.

387
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,763
Good. OK, good idea.

388
00:23:56,234 --> 00:24:02,139
Mm. Oh. Do you know how long it has
been since I have had a doughnut?

389
00:24:02,907 --> 00:24:05,967
I really, really, really, really, really
like doughnuts.

390
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,705
Why don't you eat them?

391
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,237
Got to stay on top of my game. No time
for exercise. No carbs. No sugar.

392
00:24:11,315 --> 00:24:14,113
Can't have a sugar crash in court.
You know, stupid court!

393
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:16,949
Court is stupid
because I love doughnuts!

394
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:28,423
You're making really good progress.

395
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,639
Hey there, Chief.
You here for my big moment?

396
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,904
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it, Denny.

397
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,812
Is there something
I can do for you, Chief?

398
00:24:48,886 --> 00:24:51,047
- His EKG?
- Normal.

399
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:54,216
- As well as his ECHO and nuclear study.
- Mm-hmm. His perfusion?

400
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,351
He's ready, Chief.

401
00:24:56,427 --> 00:24:59,863
Well, looking good. Carry on.

402
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,559
Thank you, sir.

403
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:07,798
Die! Die! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
Next level. I'm at the next level.

404
00:25:07,872 --> 00:25:10,340
- God, this is exhilarating!
- Good. Keep going.

405
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:13,434
Only 12 more levels before
you reach prime seizure potential.

406
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:16,309
This is fun. Yeah, right? You know?

407
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:20,180
Like fun that we had at home
back when you used to tell me things.

408
00:25:20,251 --> 00:25:22,515
- Like where you live?
- Don't start that again.

409
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,612
I'm just saying,
there's fun to be had.

410
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,782
All the time with me. Your best friend.

411
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,122
It's not like we're in high school.

412
00:25:29,193 --> 00:25:31,559
Don't do the whispering
under your breath thing.

413
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:35,224
- If you got something to say, say it.
- Last time you said that it went well.

414
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:38,166
You're pissed at me because
of what happened with Meredith?

415
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:40,568
No. Yeah.

416
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:52,946
Oh. He recorded this at
the Hollywood Bowl a couple years ago.

417
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,811
It's nice.

418
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,553
It's not nice. It's brilliant.

419
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:08,660
Excuse me. You were one of my wife's
doctors, weren't you? Rose Ward?

420
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,031
Yes, I was.

421
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:14,594
She just told me there was
a complication with her C-section.

422
00:26:14,672 --> 00:26:17,903
I told you to tell her how you feel,
not to jump into bed with her.

423
00:26:17,975 --> 00:26:20,034
- Whatever you told me.
- Adultery.

424
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,705
Why did you send me in there?
Was it to humiliate me?

425
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,715
If you knew she didn't love me.
What kind of friend does that?

426
00:26:25,783 --> 00:26:28,115
It's just... It was shocking.

427
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:31,280
Someone says there's a complication
and everything changes.

428
00:26:34,091 --> 00:26:35,786
I... can't... breathe.

429
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,227
- Are all those batteries...
- Yes, they're charged. I checked them.

430
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:42,164
- He's having runs of V-tach.
- Could be an air embolism.

431
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,633
We got to tamponade.

432
00:26:44,702 --> 00:26:47,398
- BP's not registering.
- Keep transfusing PRBCs.

433
00:26:47,471 --> 00:26:51,908
He has a full ventricular perforation.
Hand me a 20 prolene. Cristina.

434
00:26:51,976 --> 00:26:54,467
Replace my hand with yours.

435
00:26:56,013 --> 00:26:57,981
Yes. And hold on for dear life.

436
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,244
- You didn't want to hear it.
- Yes, I...

437
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:03,845
- Oh, some denial. I can work with that.
- You wanted to keep on loving her.

438
00:27:03,921 --> 00:27:06,583
- Should we intubate?
- We'll call respiratory to do it.

439
00:27:07,725 --> 00:27:10,990
Rose says it's a blessing.
It's God's will. Maybe it is.

440
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:16,364
Maybe it is. A blessing, I mean.
This complication.

441
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:19,028
- His heart's not moving.
- Keep compressing as I was.

442
00:27:19,103 --> 00:27:21,628
No signs of life.
Blood pressure is nonexistent.

443
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:24,038
- OK, the tubing could be kinked.
- I got this.

444
00:27:24,108 --> 00:27:26,702
- It doesn't look like you've got this.
- I've got this!

445
00:27:26,777 --> 00:27:29,177
Oh, my God! You knew the risks!

446
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:32,045
- That she was in love with someone.
- I'm getting an aura.

447
00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:34,880
No! I am not saying
that what she did wasn't wrong.

448
00:27:34,952 --> 00:27:39,787
- You need to take...
- She's seizing! Go page Shepherd.

449
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:43,049
This complication might be God's way
of helping you

450
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:45,994
- put your seven kids through college.
- What are you saying?

451
00:27:46,063 --> 00:27:48,395
I'm saying get a lawyer.

452
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:08,074
Time of death: 18:32.

453
00:28:11,188 --> 00:28:13,088
Everything looks good, Denny.

454
00:28:13,157 --> 00:28:15,455
Well, you got to thank Dr. Bailey
for me.

455
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:20,054
I already thanked her once,
but this here deserves a double-scoop.

456
00:28:23,434 --> 00:28:25,664
I know I don't know you very well.

457
00:28:25,736 --> 00:28:28,204
You want to talk to me about Izzie?

458
00:28:28,272 --> 00:28:29,671
Yeah.

459
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,038
- Because you disapprove?
- No.

460
00:28:32,109 --> 00:28:36,205
This comes from nothing
resembling a high horse.

461
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:40,175
High horses want nothing to do with me.

462
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:43,049
You know,
this thing with you and Izzie, it's...

463
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,817
There are strict rules
about doctors dating patients.

464
00:28:48,592 --> 00:28:50,822
You know Izzie pretty well, right?

465
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,762
You think if I went to her and I said,

466
00:28:53,831 --> 00:28:56,823
"Hey, you know, this is going to be
really bad for your career. "

467
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,301
"You probably shouldn't
come and see me anymore,"

468
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,964
You think that'll have
any effect at all?

469
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:07,978
The thing is, I was healthy
my whole life until I wasn't.

470
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:14,307
And for the last year, I've had
a lot of time to lay around in bed

471
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:16,649
and think about my life.

472
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:19,622
And the things that I remember best?

473
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:25,560
Well, those are the things that I wasn't
supposed to do and I did them anyway.

474
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:29,390
So the thing is, Meredith...

475
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:34,227
life is too damn short
to be following these rules.

476
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:39,868
May I ask what motive you had
for undermining my authority

477
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:43,380
- in front of my patient and intern?
- I'm not punishing you, Dr. Bailey.

478
00:29:43,447 --> 00:29:45,711
But you are.
I mean, I had a baby. And so you are.

479
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:47,910
And now you're sleep deprived.

480
00:29:47,985 --> 00:29:49,953
Every doctor here is sleep deprived.

481
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,886
You just came back from maternity leave,

482
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,981
and I'm not convinced
you're on your game.

483
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:58,495
This is not a punishment or a reflection
on how highly I value you.

484
00:29:58,562 --> 00:30:00,393
It's just the way it is.

485
00:30:00,464 --> 00:30:03,991
I'm sorry to interrupt, Chief.
That man is asking to talk to you.

486
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,127
Excuse me.

487
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,212
We're closed.

488
00:30:20,284 --> 00:30:21,717
Hey.

489
00:30:22,953 --> 00:30:25,012
I thought you were knitting a sweater.

490
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,489
I am. But I'm also dating.

491
00:30:28,225 --> 00:30:31,194
You. If you still want to.

492
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:36,495
- I should've called. I was going to...
- No, no.

493
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:40,697
Uh... don't call. Never call.
Always show up.

494
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,101
- OK.
- OK.

495
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,372
But I can't tonight.
I've got an errand I have to run.

496
00:30:48,245 --> 00:30:50,304
I run errands.

497
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,742
This shouldn't take long.
We can grab dinner after.

498
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:57,015
- After?
- After she gives birth.

499
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,386
- We're birthing a horse?
- Yeah.

500
00:31:01,225 --> 00:31:03,523
That was your errand?
You're birthing a horse?

501
00:31:03,594 --> 00:31:06,688
Yeah. I guess I could've
mentioned it before.

502
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:09,392
But I didn't want to scare you
back to your knitting.

503
00:31:13,637 --> 00:31:16,731
She's getting anxious.
You can wait back here.

504
00:31:16,807 --> 00:31:20,903
- Back here?
- If you want. It gets a little messy.

505
00:31:20,978 --> 00:31:23,572
Are you kidding?
I want to birth a horse.

506
00:31:35,392 --> 00:31:38,691
Richard,
we have to talk about Alex Karev.

507
00:31:38,762 --> 00:31:41,697
I know he's talented,
but his attitude, in my opinion,

508
00:31:41,765 --> 00:31:43,733
has reached an unacceptable low.

509
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:46,031
Addison.

510
00:31:46,103 --> 00:31:50,130
You've got a bigger problem today
than Alex Karev.

511
00:31:51,775 --> 00:31:56,542
Mr. Ward has been speaking with our
attorney regarding his wife's surgery.

512
00:31:56,614 --> 00:32:00,209
Now I read your chart.
I read the nurse's notes.

513
00:32:00,284 --> 00:32:04,618
Now, can you explain to me what kind
of complication from a C-section

514
00:32:04,688 --> 00:32:08,146
leads to the severing
of both fallopian tubes?

515
00:32:10,327 --> 00:32:14,229
Well, the bad news is...
you had a grand mal seizure.

516
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:16,789
The good news is we mapped it,
so now we can operate.

517
00:32:16,867 --> 00:32:20,359
No. I've decided against surgery,
Dr. Shepherd.

518
00:32:20,437 --> 00:32:22,098
- I'm sorry?
- No offense.

519
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:26,542
The risks of craniotomy... when you
explained, they're not very appealing.

520
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,009
Yes, there are risks.

521
00:32:28,078 --> 00:32:30,103
But you have to weigh those risks

522
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:33,150
with the detrimental effect
your seizures have on your life.

523
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:36,914
Unless my life is having a detrimental
effect on my seizure disorder.

524
00:32:36,987 --> 00:32:39,581
With you and your wife:
Is the bad sex your big problem

525
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:42,490
or are all the bigger problems
causing the bad sex?

526
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,326
I'm, uh... I'm not going to answer that.

527
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:50,333
All right, my point is, I had more fun
today than I can remember.

528
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:53,427
I don't have any friends.
I don't have any fun. I only have work.

529
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,903
Work and seizures.

530
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:58,464
It's no coincidence that when the
work stopped, the seizures stopped.

531
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:01,739
- Until these two started arguing.
- I'll talk to them about that.

532
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:04,440
No, you don't get it.
Watching people fight... Oh.

533
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:08,315
It's been my whole life for 15 years.
So, I'm changing my life.

534
00:33:08,385 --> 00:33:12,253
If that doesn't work, I'll come back
here and let you cut open my brain, OK?

535
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,382
All right. Fair enough.

536
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:36,001
- It's pretty good, huh?
- Yeah, it's pretty good.

537
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,860
- How're you feeling?
- A little sore.

538
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,872
Oh, that's to be expected.

539
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:12,845
I'm sorry I told Chris
about the complication.

540
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:17,649
I just... I just thought he should know
that Joseph would be our last.

541
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,647
So he could savor it.

542
00:34:22,526 --> 00:34:24,721
I didn't know he was going to do this.

543
00:34:24,795 --> 00:34:26,422
Rose.

544
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:31,093
I need you to tell him
that you asked me to tie your tubes.

545
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,701
For you, it's just insurance.

546
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:39,937
And you don't even have to pay. For me,
it's my marriage. It's my family.

547
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,706
It's my career, Rose.
It's my reputation.

548
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:48,444
You're the best. People come
from all over the country to see you.

549
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,282
That won't change.

550
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:52,322
I can't tell him.

551
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:57,989
Dr. Shepherd... I'm so sorry

552
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:00,428
because I am so grateful to you.

553
00:35:01,765 --> 00:35:03,756
But I can't tell him.

554
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,729
Is it coming off?

555
00:35:43,807 --> 00:35:45,798
Not exactly.

556
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,808
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, don't be. It was a great date.

557
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,314
Technically it wasn't the date.
It was the errand.

558
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:56,046
Now... we could go up to my place.
I could cook for you.

559
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,951
Go up to your place?

560
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:01,320
Well, do you want
to come up to my place?

561
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:02,723
Yeah. I mean, no.

562
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:07,127
No, I don't. I... I do. But I don't.

563
00:36:07,197 --> 00:36:10,360
- You don't know?
- No, I do. I mean, I... I know.

564
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,493
No, I don't.

565
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:18,438
All right, well, here's the deal.
Um... you have two options.

566
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:23,242
You could come up to my place,
take off all your clothes,

567
00:36:23,313 --> 00:36:26,043
shower off the goo, borrow a shirt,
and I'll cook dinner.

568
00:36:26,116 --> 00:36:31,315
That's door number one.
Door number two... you go home.

569
00:36:31,388 --> 00:36:36,382
I think you ought to take door one.
It involves you naked in my apartment.

570
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,690
But, you know... that's just me.

571
00:36:38,762 --> 00:36:42,562
I should point out that there's
absolutely nothing you could say

572
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:44,726
that would make me go upstairs with you.

573
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:48,568
I'm kind of offended that you think
that I would go upstairs with you.

574
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,735
And you should know
that I am celibate. So...

575
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,300
Shut up.

576
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,375
I absolutely cannot have...

577
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,712
sex with you.

578
00:37:04,788 --> 00:37:10,954
If you choose door number one,
I absolutely will not have sex with you.

579
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:12,689
- You won't?
- I promise I won't.

580
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,958
- I won't even try to kiss you.
- Why not?

581
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,693
- Meredith.
- What?

582
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:18,394
Choose door number one.

583
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:22,200
<i>A wise man once said,
"You can have anything in life,</i>

584
00:37:22,272 --> 00:37:24,968
<i>if you will sacrifice
everything else for it. "</i>

585
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:28,273
I hope it works. You changing your life.

586
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:30,906
So do I.

587
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:32,744
OK.

588
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:35,280
Hey, George.

589
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,289
I don't know much,
but I do know fighting.

590
00:37:40,357 --> 00:37:45,624
And people who fight like you and
Izzie... those people love each other.

591
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,891
She misses her friend.

592
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:51,901
<i>What he meant is,
nothing comes without a price.</i>

593
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:56,804
The road to hell
is paved with good intentions.

594
00:37:56,874 --> 00:38:01,811
<i>So before you go into battle, you better
decide how much you're willing to lose.</i>

595
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,870
Dr. Karev.

596
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:08,847
You did such a good job today
that I'm going to talk to Dr. Bailey

597
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:11,479
and have you assigned to my service.

598
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:14,490
- What? For how long?
- For as long as I want.

599
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:18,756
Your ass is mine until I say otherwise.
Congratulations.

600
00:38:21,765 --> 00:38:23,426
You got it.

601
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,293
I did indeed.

602
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,270
And you're OK?

603
00:38:28,338 --> 00:38:30,306
Are you kidding me? I'm great.

604
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:35,004
I mean look at this. Some
nice-sized batteries. Colorful wires.

605
00:38:35,078 --> 00:38:38,844
It's what your best-dressed LVAD
patients are wearing these days.

606
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:42,147
Really? Because it seems so last fall.

607
00:38:52,162 --> 00:38:54,460
You're tall.

608
00:38:54,531 --> 00:38:56,328
I know.

609
00:38:59,703 --> 00:39:03,002
<i>Too often, going after what feels good,</i>

610
00:39:03,073 --> 00:39:06,201
<i>means letting go
of what you know is right.</i>

611
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,181
You did everything you could.

612
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:27,491
There was an interview that Eugene gave.

613
00:39:27,564 --> 00:39:29,555
I saved it.

614
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,461
I taped it to my bathroom mirror.

615
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:36,939
He said that he wasn't the most
talented student at music school.

616
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:40,534
But he said what he lacked
in natural ability

617
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:43,603
he made up for in discipline.

618
00:39:44,848 --> 00:39:46,748
He practiced.

619
00:39:48,118 --> 00:39:49,949
All the time.

620
00:39:51,388 --> 00:39:53,379
All the time, he practiced.

621
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,916
I wasn't like you.

622
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:59,690
I wasn't the most talented student
in school.

623
00:39:59,763 --> 00:40:01,754
I wasn't the brightest.

624
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,691
But I was the best.

625
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,405
You practiced.

626
00:40:19,816 --> 00:40:21,807
I practiced.

627
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,278
<i>And letting someone in</i>

628
00:40:24,354 --> 00:40:28,017
<i>means abandoning the walls
you've spent a lifetime building.</i>

629
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:30,651
He was listless
and hadn't eaten all day.

630
00:40:30,727 --> 00:40:32,718
Oh, no. Let's have a look.

631
00:40:35,098 --> 00:40:40,468
<i>Of course the toughest sacrifices
are the ones we don't see coming.</i>

632
00:40:40,537 --> 00:40:42,562
Hey.

633
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:43,970
Hey.

634
00:40:47,377 --> 00:40:49,743
- Is he sick again?
- Yeah.

635
00:40:56,853 --> 00:40:58,878
- George! Hey.
- Hey.

636
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,318
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

637
00:41:03,393 --> 00:41:06,157
So we spent the night at Callie's
last night,

638
00:41:06,229 --> 00:41:08,459
so we figured
we'd just spend the night here.

639
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:14,471
Um, OK. So, um... you're back then
just... for tonight?

640
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:16,335
Well, Callie's here for the night.

641
00:41:16,406 --> 00:41:19,307
I'm, uh... I don't know.

642
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:22,311
It's my room, you know. I pay rent.

643
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,671
Welcome home.

644
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:28,616
<i>When we don't have time
to come up with a strategy,</i>

645
00:41:28,685 --> 00:41:32,451
<i>to pick a side
or to measure the potential loss.</i>

646
00:41:38,161 --> 00:41:40,561
You would not believe the day I had.

647
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:43,724
I went out of my way to give a patient
exactly what she wants,

648
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,200
only to have it explode in my face.

649
00:41:46,269 --> 00:41:48,635
I mean, lawsuit, threats.
Richard's pissed.

650
00:41:48,705 --> 00:41:51,902
- Don't get me started about Alex Karev.
- Get in the shower.

651
00:41:51,975 --> 00:41:54,375
- What?
- Get in the shower with me.

652
00:41:55,278 --> 00:41:59,408
- Honey, it's a very small shower.
- You want to have hot sex?

653

<i>When that happens,
when the battle chooses us,</i>

655
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:09,517
<i>and not the other way around,</i>

656
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:14,257
<i>that's when the sacrifice can turn out
to be more than we can bear.</i>
