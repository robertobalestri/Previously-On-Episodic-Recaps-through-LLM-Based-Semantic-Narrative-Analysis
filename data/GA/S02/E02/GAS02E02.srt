00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,992
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:04,696
Derek's married.

3
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:07,171
- Why are you here?
- You had a life in Manhattan.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,298
Had.

5
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,707
It was a business decision.
Not personal.

6
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:11,766
It is personal to me.

7
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,006
I'll only be your boss for a few days.

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,980
- I have a girlfriend.
- Olivia.

9
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,812
You and Alex?

10
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:20,045
- You gave me syphilis!
- George!

11
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,521
- It's best to make a clean break.
- Oh, you're ending this.

12
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,579
I'm pregnant.

13
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:26,887
Have you even told Burke
about the baby?

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,691
I've had a thing for my roommate since
day one. And I just can't tell her.

15
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,028
My husband didn't cheat on me.
I cheated on him.

16
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,863
- I was drowning and you saved me.
- It's not enough.

17
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:45,007
<i>I have an aunt who,</i>
<i>whenever she poured anything for you,</i>

18
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:47,137
<i>would say, "Say when."</i>

19
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,376
It's not us. It's them.

20
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:55,149
Them and their stupid boy penises.

21
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,382
They didn't tell me they had a wife.

22
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:01,359
They gave absolutely no warning that
they were going to break up with you.

23
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:05,888
It's not that Burke broke up with me.
It's how he broke up with me.

24
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:09,401
Like it was business. Like a business...
Like he's the boss of me.

25
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,495
- He is the boss of you.
- And what's worse is that I care.

26
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,267
I'm going to throw up again.

27
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,004
<i>My aunt would say, "Say when,"</i>
<i>and of course we never did.</i>

28
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,707
No. Wait.

29
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:23,214
False alarm.

30
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:26,878
- Look, the problem is estrogen.
- No, the problem is tequila.

31
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:29,820
I used to be all business,
then he gets me pregnant.

32
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:33,757
- With the stupid boy penis.
- Now I'm having hormone surges.

33
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,590
He ruined me. I'm ruined.

34
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:40,224
He turned me into this fat,
stupid, pregnant girl,

35
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,165
who cares.

36
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,698
- Estrogen.
- Penises.

37
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,003
- Penises, Izzie!
- Estrogen, George.

38
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,701
OK. What did I miss?

39
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,771
Came home to full vomit drama.
She dumped Derek. And her.

40
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,079
- She's been sleeping with Burke.
- I know.

41
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:02,679
<i>We don't say "when" because there's</i>
<i>something about the possibility of more.</i>

42
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,383
So you really broke up with Shepherd?

43
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,221
I feel empty.

44
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,488
Two hours of vomiting
will do that to you.

45
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:14,431
<i>More tequila. More love. More anything.</i>
<i>More is better.</i>

46
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,765
No, I feel empty.

47
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,963
You're lucky. I feel pissed off.

48
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,035
Stop.

49
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:29,013
- What?
- You're stalking me. Stop it.

50
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,073
Did we not communicate last night?

51
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,846
- Yes.
- Did you hear what I said?

52
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,853
Your wife screwed your best friend.

53
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,685
Then from that point on,
she no longer existed to me.

54
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,851
- You had marital amnesia.
- I bared my soul to you last night.

55
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,155
- It's not enough.
- Why?

56
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:47,359
When you waited two months to tell me
and I had to find out by her showing up,

57
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:52,132
all leggy and fabulous, and telling me
herself, you pulled the plug.

58
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,606
I'm a sink with an open drain.
Anything you say runs right out.

59
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,768
There is no enough.

60
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:03,008
- She could've picked a better metaphor.
- Give her a break. She has a hangover.

61
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:06,643
- Dr. Shepherd.
- Dr. Burke.

62
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,620
We have an organ donor coming in
from Wilkeson General.

63
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,157
- We're doing a harvest.
- Commendable, but...

64
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,420
- In OR One at four.
- I'm in OR One at four.

65
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,893
Yours is non-critical.

66
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,021
- You can't bump me.
- As chief, I can.

67
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:20,998
- Interim. Bump somebody else.
- You're in the OR we need.

68
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:24,628
- Why don't they harvest at Wilkeson?
- Small facility in the boonies.

69
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,639
We have the location,
the airport nearby and the staff.

70
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,800
Your surgery is rescheduled.

71
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:34,973
- <i> Cardiologist to the cath lab.</i>
- "Mine's bigger than yours."

72
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,046
- Whip it out. I'll measure.
- Shut up, Alex.

73
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:50,560
Male, 55, victim of a head-on collision.
GCS is three. Depressed skull fracture.

74
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,396
Multiple internal injuries. ACLS
protocol started, but his veins blew.

75
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,992
We've pushed meds down the tube.
PEA on arrival.

76
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,630
- How long?
- We've been doing CPR for 20 minutes.

77
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,937
It took Fire 20 minutes to get him out.
He's pretty much gone.

78
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,170
He's not gone until we say he's gone.

79
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,873
O'Malley, get him into a bay
and save him.

80
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,177
- But he's dead.
- Did you not hear me?

81
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,583
He's not dead until we say he's dead.
You know what to do, so do it.

82
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,918
Grey? You on this too. Move.

83
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,988
We've got three more victims
from the other car coming in!

84
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,324
- Come on.
- But he's dead.

85
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,102
Olivia.

86
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,664
- Pulseless V-tach.
- Line's in.

87
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,506
OK! Charge to 200.

88
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,977
- 200.
- Clear.

89
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,449
Push one of epi. Let's go again.
Charge to 300.

90
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:46,985
Seriously?

91
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:50,147
I think that's what Dr. Bailey
wants you to do, George.

92
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,088
You...

93
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,989
Dr. O'Malley.

94
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,758
It's what she wants, Dr. O'Malley.

95
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,493
OK then. Let's charge to 300.

96
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,899
- 300.
- Clear.

97
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,133
Male, 46, unrestrained driver
of the car that jumped lanes.

98
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:10,471
BP 80 over palp.
Tachycardic. Last pulse 1:38.

99
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:14,001
Got two liters LR running wide open.
Abdominal tenderness.

100
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,480
- Any history?
- He's got a bad liver.

101
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:19,746
- He's on the transplant list.
- Abdomen's rigid. Hands off!

102
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,652
We need to page Burke and Domner.
Who wants it?

103
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:23,916
- I do!
- I do.

104
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,117
- Too late. Stevens, take it.
- Yes.

105
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:29,628
Karev! Take the boy.
Yang, you take the mom.

106
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,630
I want to be looking at their films
in 15 minutes.

107
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:39,001
- We've got one more for you.
- What? In there? Oh, OK.

108
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,232
What is it?

109
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,206
- That guy.
- He was in the accident?

110
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:46,644
No. Bowel obstruction. He won't say what
he ingested. Films suggest he's packing.

111
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,511
Can't people figure out
a better way to move drugs?

112
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,413
Grey!

113
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,110
Pericardiocentesis. Good.
Any response?

114
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:59,523
- OK, all right, you guys can...
- Should I call it?

115
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:02,891
- What would you do next, O'Malley?
- I would call it.

116
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,896
To save him.

117
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,329
Oh... Uh...

118
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,731
- A pericardial window.
- Excellent. Do it.

119
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:12,100
Grey, you're done here.
I got a bowel obstruction for you.

120
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,736
- Fun.
- At least your patient's still alive.

121
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,270
What next, doctor?

122
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,810
</i>

123
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,738
- Stop it!
- OK. Stop. OK? That's it.

124
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:59,376
- That is not it.
- Come on, stop it. That's it.

125
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,080
- It's not. Hold still.
- How can I with you poking me?

126
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,020
I have to poke you to discharge you.

127
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,456
What makes you think
he wants to be discharged?

128
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:10,826
Derek, don't you know that this hospital
will crumble unless Richard's here?

129
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:13,457
Adele. You're meant to be
in the Virgin Islands.

130
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,468
You are in five kinds of trouble,
mister man.

131
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,369
You had brain surgery
and didn't tell me?

132
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,930
- It was a small procedure.
- It was brain surgery.

133
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:25,341
- Didn't want to ruin your vacation.
- You don't know what one is.

134
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,345
How would you know how to ruin it?

135
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,404
Well, anyway...

136
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,008
How did you find...

137
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,951
- You called my wife?
- You called mine.

138
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:38,923
Having someone at home with you is
the only way I'm letting you out today.

139
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:42,722
- Fine.
- I thought I saw a great-Iooking woman.

140
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,763
Addison! Yes, see?

141
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,492
Hi.

142
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,729
I told Richard, I knew you and Derek
would get back together.

143
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,327
- I'm here on a case.
- Addison and I are over, Adele.

144
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,635
- It's not like we're divorced.
- Practically.

145
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,904
- You've had counseling?
- We had adultery. That was enough.

146
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,312
I'll call you later, OK?

147
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,741
You should give her a chance, Derek.

148
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,310
It's good to see you.
Keep him in line.

149
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,927
- My mom's OK, right?
- Yeah, yeah, I think so.

150
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,329
They'd been fighting at breakfast.

151
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:29,933
Dad... It's ugly when it gets like that.

152
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,769
He ran three stop lights
before we even got on the freeway.

153
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,748
- My husband Bob is a good driver.
- Some guy in a pickup cuts us off.

154
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:41,412
Safe. I think he saw something
in the middle of the road and...

155
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:44,752
- My dad just lost it.
...and swerved to avoid it.

156
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:48,555
- Started chasing the guy.
- The crash just came out of nowhere.

157
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,095
Blasting through traffic.

158
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,926
We'd been having a really nice morning.

159
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,399
One minute everything's fine
and the next...

160
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:58,028
- Screaming at him.
- I saw his face before we hit.

161
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,436
Then we're upside down
across the freeway.

162
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,531
Do the surgeons know
Bob has a bad liver?

163
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:05,702
- They know.
- How's Scotty?

164
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,973
Your son's next door getting X-rayed.

165
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,073
- My dad, he...
- He's in surgery. It's pretty serious.

166
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,911
Yeah? Well.

167
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:18,423
I guess the son of a bitch
got what he deserved.

168
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,061
Here you go.

169
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,927
What makes people think
they don't need seatbelts?

170
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,961
My end is done.

171
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,902
Well, the bowel's a mess,
but it's repairable.

172
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:36,067
It's a lot of work, but I don't see
the point with this liver.

173
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,609
Forceps.

174
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:41,010
- What do you see, Dr. Stevens?
- Deep laceration, bleeding.

175
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,776
- What else?
- It's hard and pale. Cirrhotic.

176
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:47,080
- He's on the transplant list.
- Does he have family here?

177
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,552
A wife and son.

178
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,748
I'm just going to roll you over. Gently.

179
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:56,458
Oh. This looks pretty bad.
How'd you get this?

180
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:00,063
Well, we hit so hard...

181
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:03,898
I don't think it's from the collision.
It looks a couple of weeks old.

182
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,578
Where are you?

183
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:17,082
I can see his heart.
His heart that's not beating.

184
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,379
OK, open the pericardium and aspirate.

185
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,649
If the heart's still not beating,
close and call it.

186
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:26,783
What? You think
we're defiling this man's body?

187
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,892
Well, we're certainly doing more than...

188
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,953
Than what?

189
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:37,101
If they're dead or dying when they
come in you hump and hump hard. Why?

190
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:41,003
- For the experience.
- No. What else? There's something more.

191
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:46,340
You think on that. It'll come to you.

192
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:57,185
Mr. Hubble, you might make things
a little easier on yourself

193
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,656
if you would just tell us
what you've ingested.

194
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,159
We'll know anyway,
once we see your films.

195
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:06,995
You have the most beautiful features.
They're delicate. Almost porcelain.

196
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,593
Mr. Hubble, whatever you've ingested
could kill you.

197
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,470
Are you sure you don't want to tell me
what's got you blocked up inside?

198
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,271
- It might offend you.
- Is it drugs?

199
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,244
- It's not drugs.
- Mr. Hubble...

200
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,940
I promise. It's not drugs.

201
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:27,277
OK. Well, good.
I'm glad it's not drugs.

202
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,982
It's drugs. Looks like at least
ten balloons in his bowel.

203
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,186
My guess, cocaine.

204
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:40,664
Scott Seibert, 18. No fractures
or internal bleeding. Got pretty lucky.

205
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,361
- Recommendation?
- Overnight for observation.

206
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,569
- Damn!
- Lea Seibert, 43.

207
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,542
Multiple healed fractures on clavicle
and humerus. Third and fourth rib.

208
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,078
She's either a bull rider
or she's abused.

209
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,046
Kid said the accident was road rage.

210
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,310
His old man got cut off in traffic.

211
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,181
That's not the story I got.

212
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:04,279
She has a large yellowing bruise over
her right kidney, tender to palpation.

213
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:07,120
Said she got it from a fall last week.
She's bleeding.

214
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,559
Perinephric hematoma. What do you do?

215
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,994
It should take care of itself.
We'll watch it.

216
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,295
She needs bed rest. And a shrink.

217
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:21,065
- It's drugs.
- Stupid. Stupid, stupid.

218
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,041
One bursts and he's dead
in five minutes.

219
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,544
- OK, what do we do?
- Run his bowel?

220
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,409
And what does that mean? Yang?

221
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:32,315
Running the bowel entails
removing all 36 feet of the intestine

222
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:36,150
from the body cavity, searching
for the balloons then cutting them out.

223
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:40,249
Grey, book an OR. Yang, Karev, you're
in. I need all the hands I can get.

224
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,419
You sure they're balloons?

225
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,793
You have reason to believe they're not?

226
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,855
This one here's got a face.

227
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,201
So does that one.

228
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,262
They all do.

229
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,832
I'll be damned. They're Judys.

230
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,036
Judys?

231
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,209
He's swallowed the heads
of ten Judy dolls.

232
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,277
Eugh.

233
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,387
My mother used to buy me Judy dolls.

234
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,090
Manhattan Judy,
Surfer Judy, Disco Judy.

235
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,156
- I wanted one.
- I dissected them.

236
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,463
Cut off their arms
and shaved their heads.

237
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,561
Sounds like a sick and twisted story.

238
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,836
They're sexist, distorted devil toys
that create unrealistic expectations

239
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,275
catering to the porn-driven minds
of men.

240
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:36,474
You swallow a bitter pill
this morning, Yang? They're dolls.

241
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:40,349
Grey, call for a Psych consult,
then see if he has family.

242
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:44,014
- Do I still book the OR?
- Blocked bowels become necrotic bowels.

243
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,683
Check with Dr. Burke.
See if we can bump someone.

244
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,353
Those Judys got to come out today.

245
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:52,090
- Hanging another B neg.
- Using a lot of blood.

246
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,132
- Noted.
- What's the word from UNOS?

247
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,430
He's on the list,
but they don't have a liver.

248
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,938
The list won't help him now.
This liver won't stop bleeding.

249
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,098
It won't support his recovery.

250
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,472
What about the donor
that's coming in?

251
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,707
That liver's already been committed.
His only hope is a family donor.

252
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:13,548
Maybe we should call it. No use tying up
an OR if it's postponing the inevitable.

253
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,213
How much work do you have
to complete, Dr. Domner?

254
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:19,780
- Five, maybe six hours.
- That's how long we have to find one.

255
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,827
You're the chief.

256
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,403
- Any family members waiting?
- Trying to reach them.

257
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:38,034
Good. I mean, not good that
we haven't reached them.

258
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,170
- It's just good I don't have to...
- It's always hard.

259
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,509
Yeah.

260
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,910
I'm sorry about Alex.

261
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,981
That's fine. It's good, you know.

262
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,855
No need to talk about it.

263
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:58,385
You do understand that I had sex
with him before you. Not during.

264
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,191
Because when
you and I were having sex...

265
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,701
- I understand.
- Just wanted to clear the air.

266
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,530
It's clear.

267
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,403
- Perfectly clear. OK.
- OK.

268
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:16,110
- And about the syphilis...
- We don't have to talk about this.

269
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:20,117
I mean, I didn't know I had it.
I should have. I'm a nurse.

270
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:23,382
I mean, there was the sore
and I was all itchy.

271
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:27,050
OK. You know, I uh... got it.

272
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,185
You know, things happen.

273
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,923
They really do.
Things you wish you could change.

274
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,988
Yeah.

275
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:39,266
It's the chief. I got to take this.

276
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,034
Sure. George?

277
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,239
- You have to call it.
- Call it?

278
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:50,406
- Him.
- Oh. Um...

279
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,243
Time of death 1:48.

280
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,086
I got it.

281
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,406
This guy came in this morning with
ten Judy doll heads in his abdomen.

282
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,946
Is that some kind of sick or what?

283
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:25,916
I mean, when you think about it, those
things can't be that easy to swallow.

284
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,421
They still got their hair on them.
That's some bad spaghetti.

285
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,581
Dude's crapping toys.

286
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,130
You know, when you're little,
you can hide.

287
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,463
Ignore the shouting, the screaming.

288
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,166
Pretend like you're someplace else.

289
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:54,271
Then when you get older... bigger...

290
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,213
you feel like you should be
doing something.

291
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:00,342
Something to stop it.
You know, to protect her.

292
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:06,382
And when you can't,
you don't know who to be angrier at,

293
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,449
your old man or yourself.

294
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:12,462
Usually it's yourself.

295
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,297
- Did she tell you?
- She didn't have to.

296
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,361
It's all over her films.

297
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,404
He's not beating you, is he?

298
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:26,239
No. Just her.

299
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,713
So what do you do? About the anger?

300
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:33,218
Me? I think about the guy
who eats doll heads.

301
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,583
He's got problems.

302
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,048
Hey. I've been looking for you guys.

303
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,850
It's my father.

304
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:50,224
Bob liked his beers. His liver
started to fail a couple of years ago.

305
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:53,328
He quit drinking and we put him
on the transplant list,

306
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,339
- but his blood type...
- B negative.

307
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,002
There just aren't that many available.

308
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,638
They suggested a family member.

309
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,883
Any luck?

310
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,747
My son.

311
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:11,389
They say Scotty's a good match.
He's 18...

312
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:15,154
Family members shouldn't do it
out of obligation. It's risky.

313
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,218
Scotty's had counseling.

314
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,964
You know, they just don't let you do it.

315
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,601
He hasn't made his mind up yet,
you know.

316
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:28,139
We actually have a date set
for the surgery.

317
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:31,506
It's just... I just don't...
I don't want to pressure him.

318
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:33,374
Well, then you shouldn't.

319
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,471
Oh, God...
God, I don't want to lose Bob.

320
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:39,847
We'll give your son as much time
as we can to make a decision.

321
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,961
- Would you care to explain?
- Seibert is a wife beater.

322
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,294
- Her films show abuse.
- I didn't know that.

323
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:58,132
Multiple fractures. She has a kidney
bleed from a beating last week.

324
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,967
Plus, it was his road rage
that caused the accident.

325
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,940
- The guy in the other car died.
- And that means what?

326
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:06,443
No heroic measures?
We leave him on the table?

327
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,844
- If it were up to me...
- Think like a surgeon.

328
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,178
We have a dying patient
and a liver match.

329
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,242
- This is more complicated.
- For social workers, yes.

330
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,311
For the family. Not for you.

331
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,380
It isn't up to you.

332
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,790
Yeah, you've made that perfectly clear.

333
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,125
- I'm glad we have an understanding.
- I'm sure you are.

334
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:37,370
- The donor from Wilkeson?
- Should be here at three.

335
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,433
Harvest team's on their way in.

336
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,675
I need to contact the transplant center
about Seibert getting his son's liver.

337
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,877
Dr. Burke? Dr. Bailey needs an OR
and they're all booked.

338
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:49,853
- For?
- An emergent bowel obstruction.

339
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,926
- Drugs?
- Ten Judy doll heads.

340
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,018
- Seriously?
- Yes.

341
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:02,499
I can see their little faces.
"Help. Let me out."

342
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:07,005
Bump Warner's hernia in one,
but don't tell him what we're removing.

343
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,471
Thank you.

344
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:17,004
If he can't be here obsessing,
he wants stuff to obsess with at home.

345
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,846
I'll be done and out of your way
in a moment.

346
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,386
Intern time cards. Sign.

347
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,157
It's always something, isn't it?

348
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:30,321
Some emergency surgery,
some annoying administrative problem.

349
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,956
Being chief is a lot like being
an intern, the work never stops.

350
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:39,728
When I found out Richard had a tumor,
you know what I felt?

351
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:46,835
Relieved. I was hoping
he would finally be forced to retire.

352
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,711
Ah.

353
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,249
That has your attention, doesn't it?

354
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,946
How we both would like
for that to happen.

355
00:20:56,021 --> 00:21:00,082
I could finally book a vacation for two.

356
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,224
You know,
you're perfect for this job, Preston.

357
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,287
Unattached. Obsessive.

358
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:10,529
This hospital, this job,
it's enough for you, isn't it?

359
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,476
It has to be today?

360
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:25,983
Thanks. He won't make it off the table
with his own liver. He's bleeding a lot.

361
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,845
When you get counseling,
they tell you not to force it.

362
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,383
A decision, you know.

363
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:38,327
One day, one moment,
you'll just know the right thing to do.

364
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:43,224
This should be easy, right?
He's my father.

365
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,794
Well, it's a tough operation.
It'll be a big change in your life.

366
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:50,103
The upside is the liver's
the only organ that regenerates.

367
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:53,838
They'll only take half of yours.
It'll be back to normal in two months.

368
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:58,576
- You won't be running marathons, but...
- Dr. Stevens, can I see you a moment?

369
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:02,315
- What is your problem?
- You're doing a sales pitch.

370
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:06,050
The recipient is your patient.
You shouldn't be talking to the donor.

371
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,922
The recipient is his father
who he's going to lose.

372
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:13,260
And he understands that, all right?
Believe me. He understands that.

373
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,268
You have no idea
what's going on in that kid's head.

374
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,735
None.

375
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,875
- Call three times a day.
- Do not call.

376
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:28,310
- If my wife doesn't put you through...
- I won't put you through.

377
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,972
...keep calling.
- Yes, sir.

378
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:33,484
He's not talking. It could be pica.
Doubtful for a man his age.

379
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:37,545
Maybe an Oedipal complex
or idolization of the dolls as partners.

380
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,852
Or it could be that he simply enjoys it.

381
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:43,884
I've seen strange things in strange
places, but how does he enjoy this?

382
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,430
He'd enjoy them when they came out.

383
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,022
I didn't need to hear that.

384
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,069
Dr. Grey?
May I speak with you for a moment?

385
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,263
Don't look at me for help.

386
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,738
I assume he told you why he left me?

387
00:22:56,641 --> 00:23:00,975
Dr. Shepherd, with all due respect,
this has nothing to do with me.

388
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,538
Really? So you didn't take him back?

389
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:05,674
Good girl.

390
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:10,779
In future, I'd appreciate it if we kept
our relationship strictly professional.

391
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,323
Meredith?

392
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:17,021
Sometimes people do desperate things
to get someone's attention.

393
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:21,197
There are two sides to every story.

394
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:26,402
He's an alcoholic
wife beater. Shouldn't be a question.

395
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:29,167
If you didn't save him,
wouldn't it be like murder?

396
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,870
Like when he crashed into George's DOA?
He's the killer, not the son.

397
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:35,504
- That is sick.
- Who would do that?

398
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,079
Oh.

399
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,017
Look! See Judy fly.

400
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,746
- Hey, George?
- Hey.

401
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,331
What?

402
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:58,392
George. She was trying to make up
with you. You should go eat with her.

403
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,461
No. No, I shouldn't.

404
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,973
She likes you.
Don't let the syph get in the way.

405
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,975
- It's not the syph.
- So the syph.

406
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:07,534
- It is not the syph.
- Then what is it?

407
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,713
Oh.

408
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:14,578
What?

409
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,081
What is it?

410
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,884
- Say.
- There's another girl.

411
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,857
- Izzie!
- You have another girl?

412
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:23,793
- He hasn't told her yet.
- It's not high school.

413
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:26,126
- George has a little crush.
- I do not.

414
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,962
It is a thing.
A thing that is very personal.

415
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:32,663
One day I'd like to build on this thing
with this other girl... woman.

416
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:35,228
She's all woman.

417
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,571
- What are you doing?
- I was playing with...

418
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,907
No, George, with Olivia.
What are you doing with Olivia?

419
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,277
- Nothing.
- She thinks you're available.

420
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,316
She thinks she has a chance.

421
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:47,943
There is nothing worse in the world

422
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:51,511
than thinking you have a chance
when you really don't.

423
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,957
Meredith is right. Tell her there's
someone else. Tell her why.

424
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:58,928
At least give her the chance to have
some feelings about it for God's sake!

425
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,524
- Why are you yelling at me?
- Because of the estrogen, George!

426
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,073
So, new subject.

427
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,576
- It's a mess.
- No, it isn't.

428
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,777
I think I know a mess when I see a mess.

429
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:24,379
You got the harvest tying up OR One,
Seibert tying up OR Two...

430
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:25,821
It's simply a bit crowded.

431
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,325
Your "crowded"
is my "seriously overbooked."

432
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:31,590
And in my book,
seriously overbooked is a mess.

433
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,756
Is there any word on the Seibert liver?

434
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,494
- How much work do they have left?
- Couple of hours.

435
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:40,368
- Tell them I'll be in to see them.
- You bumped me for a bowel obstruction?

436
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:43,339
Uneasy lies the head
that wears the chief's cap.

437
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,874
<i> Code white, code white...</i>

438
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:50,676
Was it an act of desperation?

439
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:53,684
- Not at all.
- Something to attract attention?

440
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:55,847
Of course not.

441
00:25:55,921 --> 00:26:00,858
I'm just trying to understand here,
Mr. Hubble. Why ten doll heads?

442
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:03,759
Well, because eleven
would have been too much.

443
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,621
What's up, Dick?

444
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:10,094
I think it has something to do
with his mother.

445
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:13,831
Maybe she wanted a girl
and gave him Judy dolls as presents.

446
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,896
I got another one.

447
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:22,140
Doyen clamps to Yang.
Grey, push the head to the incision.

448
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,704
Mother looked like Judy
and he's into voodoo.

449
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:27,343
Instead of sticking pins in...

450
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,649
Yep. Ah.

451
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,348
Black Judy.

452
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:35,325
Before they gave her long hair.
Back when she had the Afro.

453
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:38,362
She came with go-go boots
and a leather jacket.

454
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,196
- Shame. It's a real collector's item.
- Collectible dolls. New twist.

455
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,566
Seriously? You can
identify these dolls by their heads?

456
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:49,539
You got a problem with that, Yang?
I like Judy dolls. I own Judy dolls.

457
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:53,476
The only problem I have with Judy dolls
is they're in the bowel of this man.

458
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:56,912
Bailey? I need an intern in the E. R.
to meet the harvest donor.

459
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,177
- O'Malley.
- See you, trooper.

460
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,616
- You good here?
- Couple more to go.

461
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:03,449
Karev, Stevens, Yang, scrub out.

462
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:05,921
We need to get an answer
from Seibert's son.

463
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:15,861
Ah, yes. Mod Judy.

464
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,959
She came with a yellow Vespa.

465
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:21,802
- Wait. You know what's strange?
- We haven't had enough strange?

466
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:24,842
She looks a little like you.

467
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,478
This is the donor from Wilkeson.

468
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:31,845
Put her in here until the
harvest team comes down. Thanks.

469
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,479
Well, this...
this one's heart is still beating.

470
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,962
I think Bailey would want me to...

471
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:50,399
We reached the family
of the dead motorist. Live in Portland.

472
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:53,028
Should be here in a few hours.
Want me to page you?

473
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:56,198
- Yeah. Do they know?
- Only that we were working on him.

474
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,603
I think it's always better
to hear bad news first hand.

475
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,980
I know I'd like to talk
to the doctor who called it.

476
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,110
Get some answers.

477
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,555
So that I could get on with my life.

478
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,361
George?

479
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:24,033
Did you... Did you see that?

480
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:29,903
She's decerebrate. Her brain's...
Her brain stem's still alive.

481
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:33,967
- OK. We'll take it from here. Thanks.
- Did you look at this?

482
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,445
She's decerebrate. OK.

483
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:40,075
Yeah, she can't really be
declared brain dead...

484
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:44,178
They probably just missed it. The cortex
is dead, the brain stem will follow.

485
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,382
Death is imminent.
We just have to wait.

486
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:49,859
- But don't you think...
- She'll be dead when we get to the OR.

487
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:53,322
But she's alive now.

488
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:09,911
It smells like a hospital in here.

489
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:13,278
What are we doing with this guy?
Is this an exercise?

490
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:16,684
- I don't need the practice.
- Transplant committee gave the OK.

491
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,347
We need an answer from the son.

492
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,290
He's using blood
like there's no tomorrow. Literally.

493
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,793
- How much work is still left?
- An hour and a half.

494
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:28,526
But, without a liver, I don't think
this guy's going to last that long.

495
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,332
I need to speak to Scotty. I can talk
to him. I need to talk to him.

496
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:39,535
I think they want him
to make the decision on his own.

497
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:43,876
You think I'm sick for wanting
to save my husband, don't you?

498
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:49,744
I think you're feeling very emotional.

499
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:52,255
And when we're feeling emotional,

500
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:58,159
sometimes it's hard to keep a level head
and to consider all the facts.

501
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:03,867
Your husband killed a man
on the highway today.

502
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:07,393
He almost killed you and your son.
Those are the facts.

503
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,341
Have you ever been in love, doctor?

504
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,244
Have you?

505
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:19,845
Love has its limits.

506
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,883
- Dr. Shepherd.
- Dr. O'Malley.

507
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:30,723
I was just in ICU
with the harvest donor.

508
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:35,391
Dr. Bailey has us do procedures and
exams on patients even if they're dead.

509
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:38,299
- What did you find?
- She's decerebrate.

510
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:41,429
The donor. Her brain stem's still alive.

511
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,472
Excuse me.
Derek Shepherd, head of neurosurgery.

512
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:50,673
Do you mind if I take a look?

513
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:53,717
OK. Yeah, she's still posturing.

514
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:56,686
We have every intention
of waiting until she's dead.

515
00:30:56,754 --> 00:31:00,349
She's in an irreversible coma.
Hines, at Wilkeson, ran the protocol.

516
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,859
Missed decerebration.
What else did they miss?

517
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,657
She has a tumor
on her uh... brain stem, right?

518
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,824
I don't see an MRI. Did you do an EEG
to confirm brain death?

519
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,630
- Yeah. According to Hines.
- I don't know Hines.

520
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,467
Six patients in three states
are waiting for organs.

521
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:18,168
They'd be happy to know the organs were
from somebody who is brain dead.

522
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:21,474
No one will touch her while she's alive.
To imply otherwise...

523
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,309
Is there a problem here?

524
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,680
This donor is still decerebrate.
I want to do an EEG and an MRI.

525
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:29,584
- An expensive waste of time.
- I insist on it.

526
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,817
- You insist on it?
- I do.

527
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,762
If my head of neurosurgery
says he needs an EEG and an MRI,

528
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,667
he needs an EEG and an MRI.

529
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,831
We have six patients waiting.

530
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,536
That is not my call, Dr. Orsen.
Who gets the organs is up to UNOS.

531
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,601
Who donates them
is up to the families.

532
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:58,410
Hell, I got a guy waiting for a liver
that may not deserve to be saved.

533
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:02,613
Again, that's not my call.
Do you want to know what my call is?

534
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:04,882
Everything else.

535
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:10,955
- The patient is yours, Dr. Shepherd.
- Thank you, Dr. Burke.

536
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,493
Dr. O'Malley,
want to assist with this MRI?

537
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:19,727
Can you carry this for me?

538
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,373
First thing we'll do is the EEG.
George, you with me?

539
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:28,107
What if he goes back to hitting her?

540
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,976
You can't make that call.

541
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:32,414
But you can't make the decision
out of anger.

542
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:34,280
- Alex!
- So what do you do with it?

543
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:36,786
- What did you do with yours?
- Alex! Hey!

544
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:40,756
- You shouldn't be out here.
- Can you just back off? Please.

545
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,326
My anger had a life of its own.

546
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,767
I became a wrestler and the next time
he laid a hand on my mother,

547
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:55,499
I beat the living crap out of him.

548
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:59,240
When he got out of the hospital,
he took off.

549
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:03,138
Just took off and never came back.

550
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:09,614
You know, he was a cold, mean-tempered
bastard, but he was still my old man.

551
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:16,827
And now I can't stop wishing
that I'd never laid a hand on him.

552
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,920
That we somehow
could've worked it through.

553
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:33,343
What is it?

554
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:35,572
Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you.

555
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,944
What? What does Burke want?

556
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,617
I'm sorry, Scott.
He needs a decision now.

557
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,203
When would it happen?

558
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:13,546
We would take Scotty
to pre-op immediately.

559
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:17,850
The transplant surgeon is on call
and waiting. There isn't much time.

560
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,417
Scotty?

561
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,657
Scotty.

562
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:53,490
Yeah. OK. I want to do it.

563
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,891
- Let's get him to pre-op.
- But I have a couple of conditions.

564
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:06,770
You're going tell the cops the truth
about what happened in this accident.

565
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:12,299
And as soon as we get back home,
you and I are moving out.

566
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:14,537
Enough is enough.

567
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:33,223
18-year-old male, liver donor,
no malignancy or transmittable diseases.

568
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,390
ETA about ten minutes.

569
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,491
You know she's going to go back to him.

570
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:40,765
- I don't know that. And it's not my...
- This is not our call.

571
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,566
Well, Cristina...

572
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:53,907
I was wondering...
I mean, I was hoping that we can...

573
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,920
- I know we didn't...
- You're asking me...

574
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:03,253
Are you OK?

575
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,356
Can I scrub in?

576
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:17,171
Then, yes, Dr. Burke. I'm OK.

577
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:26,678
Karev. Let's get him to pre-op.

578
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,751
You see the tumor
on her brain stem here?

579
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,413
Looks pretty bad.

580
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:36,256
You ever had a crappy day, O'Malley?
I mean, really, really crappy.

581
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:38,591
I've had many crappy days.

582
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:41,826
This one just got better.
You should go home, gentlemen.

583
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:44,891
I will be the only one of us
performing surgery today.

584
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,233
My friend here has a viable brain.

585
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,841
OK.

586
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,700
Do you really think she'll be OK?

587
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,611
I get the tumor out,
she's got a good shot of recovery.

588
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,883
Look out for her.

589
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,557
Meredith?

590
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:12,993
Yeah.

591
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:27,538
Oh.

592
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,603
Um...

593
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,941
- Is it the family of the dead guy?
- Yeah.

594
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:43,427
Look. Maybe I'm not over
the Alex thing or the syph thing yet.

595
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:46,990
That's not really the problem.

596
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,266
There's a girl who I...

597
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:57,034
And it doesn't matter
that there's this other guy.

598
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:01,408
And, frankly, I wouldn't care
if she gave me the Ebola virus.

599
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,375
I like you, Olivia.

600
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:13,149
But... I just don't like you enough.

601
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,628
I gave it a shot, right?

602
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:22,522
And you were honest.

603
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,662
That's good.

604
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:37,277
You know what you're going to tell them?

605
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:45,815
Why do we hump on every dead or dying
patient that comes through those doors?

606
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,255
Experience?

607
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:51,091
So we can tell their family
that we did everything we could.

608
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:04,297
Are you Ted's family?

609
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:16,879
- Just when the day was improving.
- You told Meredith what happened?

610
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,479
I did. What did you tell her?

611
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:22,526
People do desperate things
to attract attention.

612
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:28,293
What? Wow. That's your side of this?
That I didn't pay you enough attention?

613
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,028
You thought that
when you got naked with my friend?

614
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:33,536
No. By that point,
I wasn't thinking at all.

615
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,595
I was just scratching an itch.

616
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:38,642
We got successful, you and me.
We got busy and we got lazy.

617
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,904
We didn't even bother to fight anymore.

618
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:43,378
And Mark was there, and I missed you.

619
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:46,814
And now I'm sorry. I'm more sorry
than you can possibly imagine,

620
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,580
but at least I'm talking to you
about it. Derek...

621
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:51,678
I'm a sink with an open drain, Addie.

622
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:57,456
- Did you get them all?
- Yes.

623
00:39:57,528 --> 00:40:00,326
It wasn't easy or very pleasant.

624
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,832
How do you feel?

625
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,336
Empty. I feel empty now.

626
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:11,901
Yeah, I've been feeling
a little bit of that myself lately.

627
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,677
I could see that.

628
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:24,613
Mr. Hubble. Why does eating doll heads
fill you up? What's the satisfaction?

629
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,747
Do you really want to know?

630
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:31,487
Would it be too much information?

631
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:33,887
It might.

632
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,392
Maybe I'm better left in the dark.

633
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:42,800
<i> There's something to be said</i>
<i>about a glass half full.</i>

634
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:48,944
<i>About knowing when to say "when."</i>

635
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,982
<i>I think it's a floating line.</i>

636
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:05,825
<i>A barometer of need and desire.</i>

637
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:19,840
<i>It's entirely up to the individual...</i>

638
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:29,311
<i>and depends on what's being poured.</i>

639
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:45,699
<i>Sometimes, all we want is a taste.</i>

640
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:55,269
<i>Other times,</i>
<i>there's no such thing as enough.</i>

641
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,837
<i>The glass is bottomless.</i>

642
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:10,455
<i>And all we want...</i>

643
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,461
<i>is more.</i>
