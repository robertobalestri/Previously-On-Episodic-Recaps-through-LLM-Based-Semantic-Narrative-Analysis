00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:03,359
<i> Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:05,131
- Patient's name!
- How many times...

3
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:06,968
- Ellis Grey.
- Meredith's mother.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,806
It's not that Burke broke up with me,
it's how he broke up with me.

5
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:13,004
Have you even told Burke about the baby?

6
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,546
Cristina!

7
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,980
It's an extrauterine pregnancy.

8
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,350
Stop talking to me like you're
my boyfriend! Stop talking to me at all.

9
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,219
If you came here to try to win me back,
forget about it.

10
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,121
I just know I still love you.

11
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:29,355
Hating you is the most exhausting.

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:42,533
<i> The key to surviving</i>
<i>a surgical internship is denial.</i>

13
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:46,101
<i>We deny that we're tired,</i>
<i>we deny that we're scared,</i>

14
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,875
<i>we deny how badly</i>
<i>we want to succeed,</i>

15
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:52,611
<i>and most importantly,</i>
<i>we deny that we're in denial.</i>

16
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:54,676
When I left, Cristina said she was OK.

17
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:57,746
Nobody goes through what she did
and is totally over it by now.

18
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,883
- Cristina can.
- She's fine.

19
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,586
Too fine. She's cold.

20
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:04,095
No, she's hardcore.
She's got ice in her veins.

21
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,860
- She does what she has to do to.
- She lost a baby.

22
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,629
And a fallopian tube.
She acts like she doesn't care.

23
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:11,499
She's all "Hello, I'm totally fine."

24
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:15,837
She's my friend too but she's acting
like she has no emotions or warmth,

25
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,900
like she's missing a soul.

26
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,605
- God, she's gonna make a great surgeon.
- George!

27
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,081
It's true. You show no weakness,
you make it to the top.

28
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,846
Some people just keep their feelings
to themselves.

29
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,115
<i></i>
<i>We only see what we want to see</i>

30
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,419
<i>and believe what we want to believe.</i>

31
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,924
<i>And it works.</i>

32
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:36,120
<i>We lie to ourselves so much that,</i>
<i>after a while,</i>

33
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,630
<i>the lies start to seem like the truth.</i>

34
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,189
Meredith kissed me. Addison kissed me.

35
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,862
My wife and my girlfriend kissed me
on the same day.

36
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,133
Joe, do I look friendly to you?

37
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:50,574
Oh. Yeah, you're a tiny little kitten
of joy and love.

38
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,771
- What? He saved my life.
- His first mistake.

39
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,112
McDreamy, go sit by someone who cares.

40
00:01:57,183 --> 00:02:01,313
<i> We deny so much</i>
<i>that we can't recognize the truth,</i>

41
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,184
<i>right in front of our faces.</i>

42
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:07,352
Everything's gonna be fine.
Addison'll go back to New York.

43
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:11,796
Meredith and I will start over,
everything's gonna be fine. Right?

44
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,833
You so damn stupid.

45
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,867
I want everyone focused.

46
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:23,739
With Cristina out, we're short an intern
and I feel it will be one of those days.

47
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,210
- And, Karev, see the chief today.
- What for?

48
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,612
Do I look psychic to you?
He's the chief. He asked. You go.

49
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:33,209
- What did he do now?
- Maybe he gave the chief syphilis.

50
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:37,586
So we're in the middle of
the Belizian jungle and this jaguarondi

51
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,251
jumps out and bites one of the guides.

52
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,762
They all look at me. They're yelling,
"You're a doctor, help him!"

53
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,856
This is one time a Ph. D. does no good.

54
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,197
I'm sorry, did I miss the bell
for social hour?

55
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,533
- Missionary tales.
- You're a missionary?

56
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,198
No, my parents.
We traveled a lot. They still do.

57
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,367
Wow. This stuff is great.

58
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,273
Um, this is Dr. Burke's patient,
Kalpana Vera...

59
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,611
"Kull-punnah."
Named by villagers in Nepal.

60
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:07,278
Presents with multiple syncopal
episodes and ventricular arrhythmias.

61
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,413
- So you've been passing out?
- And having palpitations.

62
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,789
History of rheumatic heart disease
with mitral valve stenosis.

63
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,260
They had to ship me
from Zambia to the States

64
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:20,663
for three months of treatment when I was
eight. Rheumatic fever almost killed me.

65
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:24,567
Dr. Stevens. What are the primary causes
of ventricular arrhythmias?

66
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:27,299
Valvular disease, mitral valve prolapse,

67
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,069
stimulants, drugs,
and metabolic abnormalities.

68
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,871
<i> Scrub nurse to OR Six.</i>

69
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,539
- What?
- Out.

70
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,845
- I'm fine.
- Out!

71
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,681
You better be in your room
by the time we round on you.

72
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:44,382
- And when will that be?
- In fifteen seconds.

73
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:48,086
Fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven...

74
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,823
Nice panties, Yang.

75
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,193
In your dreams, Evil Spawn.

76
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:00,199
Cristina Yang. Post-op day three
from a unilateral salpingectomy.

77
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,605
- And ready to get back to work.
- Is she?

78
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:06,475
I'm taking solids and my pain
is controlled with oral meds. I'm ready.

79
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,413
Didn't the nurse say this morning
you had a fever?

80
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,076
- Mother.
- Cristina, did you have a fever?

81
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,013
Temp spiked to 101 last night.
Big deal.

82
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,423
She worked two shifts
with a 102 degree flu.

83
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,393
Yes. Exactly, George. Thank you.

84
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:26,330
And we appreciate your dedication,
but you stay in bed until it normalizes.

85
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,891
I keep telling her there's more to life
than surgery and career.

86
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,630
Go upholster something.

87
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,867
Look, I need you to relax, shut up,
and get better.

88
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,399
You're a patient this week
so you can be a doctor next week.

89
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,345
Mer. You cannot leave me alone with her.

90
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,315
I am flying over the cuckoo's nest here.
Save me.

91
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:48,252
- You need time to heal.
- I'm healed. I'm healed!

92
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:55,085
Oh, God.

93
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,493
OK, Dr. O'Malley, you're presenting.

94
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:01,590
OK, Dr. Grey is post-op day three
from a tumor resection.

95
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,193
Wrong, wrong, wrong.
He's got it all wrong.

96
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,467
It's not asthma, it's GERD.
He needs a Nissen fundoplication.

97
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,168
- I don't want her in the room.
- Mom!

98
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:13,007
She's a child
and I won't have her on my team.

99
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,445
We'll meet you outside, Dr. Grey.

100
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:22,616
<i> Dr. Marash to Cardiology.</i>
<i>Dr. Marash to Cardiology.</i>

101
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,657
- Skipping rounds?
- Avoiding mother.

102
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,385
Meredith...

103
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,427
- You've got a wife.
- Yes.

104
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,519
- Your life is complicated.
- Yes.

105
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:33,588
I don't need complicated.
I have complicated all on my own.

106
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,497
- Yes.
- Stop saying yes.

107
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,900
I'm trying not to make
any sudden movements.

108
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,306
- You think this is funny?
- Addison's leaving.

109
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,434
She doesn't have
any more patients here.

110
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,001
- There's no reason for her to be here.
- No reason?

111
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,139
None whatsoever.

112
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,479
Well now, isn't this cozy?

113
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,179
Can I join in
or are you not into threesomes?

114
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,845
<i> Dr. Shannon, 1436.</i>

115
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,049
- I have to go.
- Meredith...

116
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,753
You really are Satan.
You realize that, right?

117
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,320
If Satan were to take physical form,
he'd be you.

118
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,866
- Everywhere, all the time.
- I am so not Satan.

119
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,630
Why haven't you gotten
on your broomstick and left?

120
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,263
- Stop being petty.
- Stop being an adulterous bitch.

121
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,299
You are going to forgive me eventually?

122
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,106
You can't just...

123
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,738
There was a time you thought of me
as your best friend?

124
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,612
There was a time when I thought
you were the love of my life.

125
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,652
Things change.

126
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,823
Divorce papers.

127
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,230
Your lawyer said they're OK.
I haven't signed them yet.

128
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,928
The ball's in your court.
If you sign, I'll sign.

129
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,995
I'll sign and be on
the first plane out of here.

130
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,906
I'll sign them immediately.
I want you out of here soon.

131
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,916
Derek, have you ever thought that, even
if I am Satan and an adulterous bitch,

132
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,475
that I still might be
the love of your life?

133
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,876
It's my chart.

134
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:09,649
You're the patient. Not the doctor.
Act like one.

135
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,682
- It's been tough finding you alone.
- Yeah? Well...

136
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,626
- How are you doing?
- You have my chart. You tell me.

137
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,357
How are you doing?

138
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,137
I'm fine. Perfectly OK.

139
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,538
- I had a right to know.
- Well, now you do.

140
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,977
- Cristina...
- Look. Now you know. It's over.

141
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:37,675
There's nothing for you to deal with.
So what else is there left to say?

142
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,151
- Plenty. For starters...
- Oh, look. It's my mother.

143
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,056
Dr. Preston Burke.
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Yang.

144
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,060
Actually it's Rubenstein.

145
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:52,825
Dr. Saul Rubenstein of Beverly Hills?
The oral surgeon?

146
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:57,836
I'm remarried. Been remarried since
Cristina was, what? About three?

147
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:01,237
Mom, that's too much information,
he has other things to do.

148
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,869
You're good-Iooking. He's good-Iooking.

149
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:08,038
Why don't you ever bring home
a man as good-Iooking as him?

150
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,139
- Stop.
- What?

151
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:14,380
- Stop talking.
- Cristina. Forgive her.

152
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:18,150
I don't know what I ever did
to raise such an unpleasant girl.

153
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,091
- Oh, me? I'm unpleasant?
- Excuse me.

154
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,921
- Do you know who that was?
- Who?

155
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,228
- That was my boss!
- I only said nice things.

156
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,895
Why'd you call me unpleasant
in front of my boss?

157
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,097
Lighten up, please.

158
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:37,108
OK, I was thinking that maybe
we might want to... you might...

159
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:40,339
- OK, we both have tonight off so...
- You are so into me.

160
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,507
- Shut up.
- It's sad. The worship. The adoration.

161
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,847
And I'm so handsome,
I intoxicate you.

162
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,715
OK, you know what? Forget it.

163
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,585
Izzie, would you like to go out
with me tonight?

164
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:54,092
On a date? And you wear
something gorgeous, I pay for food...

165
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,061
- Are you making fun of me?
- I'm not making fun of you.

166
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,619
OK, then.

167
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,189
- Good.
- Good.

168
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,834
I said I never wanted to see you again.

169
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,371
'Cause you're too lazy
to learn anything more.

170
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,430
Dr. Meredith Grey, Jeremiah Tate.

171
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,840
Thinks he knows so much
because he was my first intern patient.

172
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:16,405
I knew as much as her. She was clueless
about how to treat cystic fibrosis.

173
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,973
A cholecystectomy
turned into a month-Iong stay.

174
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,951
Better not be alleging malpractice.

175
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,150
Guy raises about 100,000 grand a year
for cystic fibrosis, running triathlons.

176
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,784
- Thinks he's a big shot.
- You run triathlons?

177
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,828
- Why not?
- Pain for one.

178
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,887
- Finally admitting to feeling a little?
- A little.

179
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,899
How little? Truth.

180
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,959
Enough to keep me awake at night.

181
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:43,304
Had some seizures.
Too weak to work out.

182
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,936
Anyone been through here
with your CT results?

183
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:51,177
No. It's probably just my pancreatitis
kicking up again.

184
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,343
All right then. We'll be back.

185
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,717
With your results and a plan.

186
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,348
Where do your parents
think you are this time?

187
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,590
New Jersey.

188
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,162
What about his parents?

189
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:11,135
He doesn't like to bother them until
he's well or about to get discharged.

190
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:14,468
He understands his reality.
He just chooses to ignore it.

191
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,940
Denial works for him, Grey.

192
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,738
"Abdominal pain."

193
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,007
"Perirectal abscess."

194
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,939
"Gunshot wound to the head."

195
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:29,811
Where the hell's this GSW to the head?
Why wasn't the trauma team called?

196
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,517
Hello? Are you people insane?

197
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,650
There's your gunshot victim.

198
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,117
Him?

199
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:47,638
I'm redoing the living room
in beige silks, I'm thinking.

200
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:51,773
And modern. Very mid-century.

201
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:55,041
- And the dining room...
- Mother, give me back my toes.

202
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:58,982
OK. I change the subject.

203
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,982
- Who's the father?
- Mid-century, did you say?

204
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:07,219
Someone you work with, right?
Was it just for sex?

205
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:10,057
You make such a point
of not forming attachments.

206
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:13,997
20 minutes. All I want is 20 minutes
of peace and quiet.

207
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:18,594
The daughter I raised
would appreciate her mother's help.

208
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:22,903
The daughter you raised
is begging for you to go. Now.

209
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:26,103
I didn't have to come here.
You know I'm very busy.

210
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,544
Yeah, I know.
Redecorating your house.

211
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,385
Well, can you get me
a mocha latte, please?

212
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,320
A non-fat one.

213
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,187
No. A fat one!

214
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:51,801
You're walking, you're talking,
there's no exit wound.

215
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:56,971
- This mark here looks more like a burn.
- I'm telling you, I shot myself.

216
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,307
Pulled the trigger cleaning my.22.
I thought the clip was out.

217
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,313
If you're thinking suicide, don't.

218
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,906
People make mistakes. I made a mistake.

219
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:10,285
And now I'm paying for it.
But I did shoot myself.

220
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,196
- Where's your IV?
- I'm taking solids. I Hep-Locked it.

221
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,064
- On whose orders?
- Mine.

222
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:27,094
OK. Yang.

223
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:31,769
How about this order: "Bed rest, out
of bed to chair, bathroom privileges."

224
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,074
Nothing about stealing charts.

225
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,740
OK, you know what.
Hey. Give me that.

226
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:44,150
There. Satisfied?
I'm "out of bed to chair."

227
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,657
- I'm telling your intern on you.
- Meredith?

228
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,023
- Yep.
- Oh, I'm so scared.

229
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,696
- Dr. Grey, how are you doing?
- You're here. Good.

230
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,798
I need the results of the
barium esophagram or the EGD.

231
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:07,642
And you have neither. OK, no worries.
I'll be here when you get back.

232
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,473
So today you're her intern. Well,
that's better than being her husband.

233
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,714
- That's a matter of opinion.
- Good morning, Ellis.

234
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:19,189
Richard, good to see you.
I need those labs immediately.

235
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:23,752
Chief?
She's not a surgical patient anymore.

236
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,888
And I'd really like
to get back to the OR.

237
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,729
So, do you think I could hand her off
to someone else?

238
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:34,398
O'Malley, Alzheimer's causes her reality
to shift depending on situation or mood.

239
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,338
She needs stability right now.

240
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:39,775
That's why I'm depending on you
to keep a special eye on her.

241
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,642
Yes, I know, sir.

242
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,615
But, you know,
it just doesn't seem fair to me.

243
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,277
I need those studies yesterday.

244
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,214
You heard the doctor.

245
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,280
Get moving.

246
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:00,056
I saw that. I saw you take that pill.

247
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,903
Oh, it's my pill.
You know, the pill.

248
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:10,168
It's not in your chart. You're supposed
to tell us all the meds you're on.

249
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,767
You're not my doctor.
You shouldn't even be here.

250
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:16,576
- She's right. You shouldn't be here.
- She took unauthorized medication.

251
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,618
I'm on the pill and I had
grapefruit juice this morning.

252
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:23,143
Since the juice inhibits enzymes
involved in the metabolism of OCPs,

253
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:26,282
I avoided the interaction
by taking it two hours after food.

254
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,622
She has a doctorate
in neuropharmacology.

255
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,855
- I don't see oral contraceptives.
- Guys.

256
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,422
Now you will. Go back to bed
and stop poaching my patients?

257
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,067
This is ridiculous! Go back to bed
and stop poaching my patients!

258
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,102
- She's in V-fib!
- Call the code!

259
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,979
<i> Code blue, second floor.</i>

260
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:51,608
<i>Code blue, second floor.</i>

261
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:54,915
- You got the code equipment?
- It's all ready to go.

262
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,716
- No code?
- Not anymore.

263
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,622
- Can you help us get her back in bed?
- I'll help.

264
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,990
Would you just go back to bed? Go!

265
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:07,089
Oh, God. You know, Izzie, if she's
on OCPs, can we mark it down, OK?

266
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,565
Yeah.

267
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,707
Jeremiah's got a mass
in his midepigastrium.

268
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,243
Diffused enlargement of the pancreas.

269
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,541
That, with his hypoglycemic seizures...

270
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:24,104
He's gonna need
an exploratory laparotomy.

271
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:29,587
But, despite his triathlons,
his lungs still make me hesitant to cut.

272
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,646
What are we going to do?

273
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,184
- I don't know that yet.
- Doctors.

274
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,229
- Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd.
- How old is he?

275
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:41,061
- He's 26.
- A survivor, huh?

276
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:44,125
And then some.
My patient for at least five years.

277
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,502
- I'm not gonna lose him now.
- You planning a laparotomy?

278
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,097
Yeah, but his lungs.

279
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,608
You know,
I think I could help you with this.

280
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,168
I've seen one case like this
in a nine-year-old.

281
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,214
We had to do a total pancreatectomy.

282
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:59,045
I'd be honored to take any help
you can give me.

283
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,586
You're a neonatal specialist.
What...

284
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,615
This isn't your area.

285
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,448
I'm just saying. I...

286
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,892
I did genetics research
in cystic fibrosis.

287
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,863
- I've pretty much seen it all.
- Oh.

288
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,098
<i>Dr. Ramirez, please call extension 543.</i>

289
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:19,626
Just because she offered her services
doesn't mean she intends to stay.

290
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,765
- Well, what does it mean?
- It means that she's a good doctor.

291
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,476
- Why are you suddenly defending her?
- I'm not.

292
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,742
Meredith, she gave me divorce papers.
She filed.

293
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:33,216
Oh. Well, that's good.

294
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:36,311
All I have to do is sign, and I'm free.

295
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,088
We're free.

296
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,951
Is there anything to think about?

297
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,517
No, of course not.

298
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:47,087
I read through them, sign, then
Addison's on the next plane out of here.

299
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,232
- You say he got shot in the head?
- He says he got shot in the head.

300
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,238
I say he's a mental defect.

301
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:56,672
- Hi.
- Ma'am, you can't be in here.

302
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,677
I'm looking for Samuel Linden, he...

303
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:05,973
Oh, my God. Samuel.
Well, how bad is it?

304
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:09,350
- Are you his wife?
- For 21 years. Just tell me how he is.

305
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,912
Fine, for a man who says
he shot himself.

306
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:18,362
He shot himself. He was cleaning his
gun. What is wrong with you people?

307
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,455
We'll know when we finish his CT.

308
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:24,298
- This is a restricted area, ma'am.
- My husband has a bullet in his head!

309
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,200
Then we'll find it. Wait outside,

310
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,263
I'll be with you as soon as
we know something, I promise.

311
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:38,244
Of all the fine doctors in the city, you
accept a consult from Addison Shepherd?

312
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,684
- Montgomery-Shepherd, isn't it?
- She should be on her way home.

313
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,382
You're trying to drive me crazy,
aren't you?

314
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,716
Hey, don't...

315
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,058
You think this has
something to do with you?

316
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,224
You think I'm even thinking about
your romantic problems?

317
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,633
I'm trying to help a patient
very near and dear to my heart.

318
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,673
And if consulting with your wife,
your ex, your mistress,

319
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,107
whatever she becomes, if that's
what's needed to save my patient,

320
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,112
- then I'm damned well going to do it.
- I understand that.

321
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,475
I deserved that. It's...

322
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,509
Look, you have put yourself
between two very fine women

323
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,612
and you're looking for an easy way out.

324
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,487
You want to use me, the hospital,

325
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,325
somebody to make the decision
for you, and it's not gonna happen!

326
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,333
- Could I just say a couple of things?
- Just...

327
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,902
You scared us a little there.
How's her work-up coming?

328
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:44,142
Electrolytes are within normal limits,
urine tox was negative and EKG's fine.

329
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:47,583
Tilt test is scheduled for noon.
Oh, and she's on contraceptives.

330
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,518
- So?
- That's what I said.

331
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,886
That other doctor
made such a big deal of it.

332
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:55,757
She didn't tell us before.
So I documented it in her med list.

333
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:59,490
- What other doctor?
- Cristina. She was wandering the halls.

334
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,160
Fine. Take her down for an echo.

335
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,830
An echo?
What about cardioversion or ablation?

336
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:10,306
Won't I need a pacemaker
or a permanent internal defibrillator?

337
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,367
Although it would be unusual
for rheumatic heart disease

338
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:17,506
to cause ventricular dysrhythmias,
we've still got to check your valves.

339
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:24,247
I thought your doctorate was
in neuropharmacology, not medicine.

340
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,722
It is.

341
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,797
Addison gave Derek divorce papers,
which is good.

342
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:38,768
I mean, she's still here, being Addison,
but it's not like I'm jealous.

343
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:41,567
- That's odd.
- It's odd that I'm not jealous?

344
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,631
No, you have every right to be jealous.

345
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:47,611
It's your territory and she's peeing all
over it. What's odd is Burke's patient.

346
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,739
Four other hospitals this year.
Something's not right.

347
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:54,582
- Why the interest in Burke's patient?
- This has nothing to do with Burke.

348
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,952
You lost a fallopian tube, a baby,
and a boyfriend all in one day.

349
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,615
You have the right to be upset.

350
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:03,183
You're losing McDreamy to his wife.
You have a right to be jealous.

351
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,925
I did not lose McDreamy. Divorce papers,
remember? And I'm not jealous.

352
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,695
- And I'm not upset.
- You really should be in your room.

353
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,431
If this was reversed, would you
want to spend time with your mother

354
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,735
in a confined room with one window?

355
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:21,141
Do you think we're like them?
Our mothers?

356
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:29,982
Uh, where's your mom?

357
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,649
Exactly. Where is my mother?

358
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:35,454
- Where's your mother?
- Funny you should ask.

359
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,119
Oh, crap.

360
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:41,196
Oh, man,
you are not going to believe this.

361
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:46,202
No. It can't be. The guy was reading
a freaking magazine.

362
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:49,297
It's definitely a bullet.
Tracked clear through his head.

363
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,708
Now are you people just going
to sit here or get him into surgery?

364
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:03,580
Here's the missile track. As you can see
it doesn't even cross the midline.

365
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:07,147
He's lucky. This guy may have even
been sitting there talking to you.

366
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:10,592
He'll need debridement of the
entrance wound and repair the dura,

367
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,823
but we won't need to remove the bullet.

368
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:15,196
That's an excellent diagnosis, Dr. Grey.

369
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:18,293
I'm Dr. Shepherd,
I'm your neuro consult.

370
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,828
Dr. Grey, they need you upstairs.

371
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:25,801
- You'll book the OR and staff?
- I'm on it.

372
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:32,450
- Unbelievable.
- O'Malley.

373
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,617
Can you not handle this, doctor?

374
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:41,725
I can handle a lot of things.
Wheelchairs. Come on, Dr. Grey.

375
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,353
We won't know for sure
until we go in there,

376
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:47,296
but it looks like I'm gonna have
to take out your pancreas

377
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,163
and re-route your intestines.

378
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:52,135
Did you tell her my lungs
don't do well with anesthesia?

379
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,694
Don't I always have your back?

380
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,240
Your kidney function is decreasing
and I'm afraid

381
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:59,402
you'll go into multi-system
organ failure if we don't operate.

382
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:03,471
- If I say no?
- There's no guarantees, Jeremiah.

383
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:07,541
It's going to be a long, hard surgery,
and put a lot of stress on your body.

384
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,644
Yeah, but I'm me.

385
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:15,750
- But you're you.
- So if we don't operate, I die.

386
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:19,991
And if we do operate, I may die.

387
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,999
Basically, yes.

388
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,763
Well, I like those odds.

389
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:29,068
And 26 years with this disease
is awesome. And that's the reality.

390
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:33,100
So if I get lucky, great.

391
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,169
If I don't...

392
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:43,786
it's been sweet.

393
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,289
It's gonna stay sweet.

394
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,055
We'll need to do a psych evaluation.

395
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:54,258
How many times do we have to tell you?
He wasn't trying to kill himself.

396
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:57,597
- It was an accident.
- They're just doing their job, hon.

397
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,763
- Their job is to make you better.
- Where were you at the time?

398
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:05,367
I was in the next room.
And I heard the shot. And it was awful.

399
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:09,446
- It's over now.
- Why didn't you call 911?

400
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:12,039
Because he was only unconscious
for a moment.

401
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,211
And then he was walking,
and talking and...

402
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,414
You'll have to give a report
to the police.

403
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:20,014
- Police?
- Why do we need to talk to the police?

404
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:23,390
We have to report any gunshot wounds
to the police. It's the law.

405
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,132
You're officially AWOL, you know.

406
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:39,667
I'm working. Trying to figure out what's
going on with the crazy woman on four.

407
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:41,336
You are the crazy woman on four.

408
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:44,473
I made a break for freedom.
Hand me that dictionary.

409
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:49,543
You have a better patient than
me and you don't even have a patient.

410
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:52,419
Meredith's got a CF case.
Alex's got the gunshot wound.

411
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,688
Izzie's got the mystery arrhythmias.
I'm not a nanny.

412
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,695
I am a surgeon. A cutter.

413
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:04,360
But no, I'm getting fake labs for a fake
patient so she can do a fake surgery.

414
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:11,771
- She's faking it.
- It's real to her. It's Alzheimer's.

415
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,505
The missionary. Kalpana...

416
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:18,407
God! Thank you!

417
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,043
Ow!

418
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,710
Uncalled for!

419
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:27,390
- Izzie. How have her studies been?
- I've been looking for that everywhere.

420
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,086
Negative, right?

421
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,153
Oh! The echo test showed mild mitral
stenosis, the tilt test was negative.

422
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:34,562
We're doing EP studies.

423
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:38,000
I know what's wrong without
sticking electrodes in her heart.

424
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:41,038
- Really. Just by the chart?
- No, from the pill she took.

425
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:45,236
They were contraceptives. Why are you so
obsessed with this? Just go back to bed.

426
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,746
- She's doing this to herself.
- Inducing ventricular arrhythmias?

427
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:52,044
- She'd have to be crazy.
- No, she'd have to have Munchausen's.

428
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:56,281
Wait. You think she's secretly ingesting
something to produce real symptoms?

429
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,618
- Seriously?
- Yep. Just run it by Burke.

430
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,251
- Tell me what he thinks.
- Tell him yourself. He's behind you.

431
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,202
- Where are we?
- OR Two in 30 minutes.

432
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,673
He's prepped, transpo's on the way.

433
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,734
Do you understand that?
21 years!

434
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:23,144
- What's that all about?
- I haven't got a clue.

435
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,341
I love you. I forgive you.

436
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,545
You cheated on me. You cheated on me.

437
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,612
- You do not get to play the martyr.
- I got a bullet in my head.

438
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,420
- And that doesn't make us even.
- You shot me!

439
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:37,222
I think we need to get the police
up here right now.

440
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:41,922
She obviously loves the patient role.
She practically lives in hospitals.

441
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,901
And we're like an imaginary family
to her

442
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,462
because her real family blows her off
to go take care of other people.

443
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,202
- And I saw her take something.
- That's not enough.

444
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,710
We have to rule out everything else.

445
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,645
She lied about her job.
She's a pharmacy tech, not a Ph. D.

446
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,775
So she's a liar.
I've been lied to before.

447
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:05,053
- We're not talking about us here.
- Maybe we should be.

448
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,216
- I didn't lie.
- You withheld the truth.

449
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,557
OK, you know what? I remember you
breaking things off with me.

450
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:14,565
You didn't seem so upset about it.
This? This is not a relationship.

451
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,498
- This is not real.
- Cristina!

452
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:21,938
OK, and so what's with
the big fake display of hurt and drama?

453
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,998
- Cristina!
- I'm supposed to be in bed.

454
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:26,066
Cristina!

455
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,819
Officers, thanks for coming.

456
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:46,159
Ma'am, why don't you have a seat?
We need to ask you a few questions.

457
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,358
Uh, of course.

458
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:52,062
Well, nothing like a domestic dispute
to liven up a pre-op, huh?

459
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:59,844
- Where do I sign?
- Here, for consent.

460
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:04,644
And here for DNR
and no extraordinary measures.

461
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:08,845
Good. OK, lift up for me.

462
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,589
You should probably call my parents.

463
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:19,596
Call them yourself
when you walk out of here.

464
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,700
Dr. Grey, I have those labs...

465
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:34,609
Oh, no you didn't.
You lost her again? Again?

466
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:38,080
I am a surgeon. A surgeon!

467
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,343
Yeah, well.

468
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:42,545
You won't be when Dr. Webber
finds out you lost Ellis Grey again.

469
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:50,594
We're using three different catheters.
Why are we doing that, Dr. Stevens?

470
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:54,189
Programmed electrical stimulation
maps the heart's electrical system

471
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:57,632
- to find the focus of the irregular...
- Doctors? Sorry to interrupt.

472
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:00,569
- Yes?
- Her urine's blue.

473
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,734
What?

474
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,735
Why is her urine blue?

475
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:12,676
She says she has a surgery scheduled
with Dr. Shepherd?

476
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,379
- I turned my back for...
- Why did you turn your back?

477
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,444
I told you to take care of her!

478
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,087
Just get out of here.

479
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,096
You want to find a hot surgery,
then find one.

480
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:28,098
You're free.

481
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,134
I'll take care of her.

482
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:41,570
This is one sick bastard. We
should flip him over, give him a spine.

483
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:44,774
Pull back on the retractor, Dr. Karev.
A little suction.

484
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:47,044
Covering for his wife
after she shot him?

485
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:50,212
- He did cheat on her.
- And that's worth a bullet in the head?

486
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,549
Relationships are built on sacrifice.

487
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,116
- Not that kind of sacrifice.
- I don't know.

488
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,287
Sometimes a bullet's worth it.

489
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:12,807
Richard, I thought you'd never get here.

490
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:17,473
Look, the OR's empty,
I have a little time before my surgery.

491
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,357
I don't think I'm supposed to be here.

492
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,796
No.

493
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:39,096
No, you're not.

494
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:43,567
Come on,
I'll take you back to your room.

495
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,753
I need more traction. Dr. Grey?

496
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,917
Here, give me some suction there.

497
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:07,154
Grey, retract the duodenum. Good.

498
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:08,597
How's he doing?

499
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,794
- Hard to ventilate and no urine output.
- He's shutting down.

500
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,135
- Did you increase peak pressures?
- Any higher, I blow his lungs.

501
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,936
Bradycardia. Pushing one of atropine.

502
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:23,306
Try ventilating him manually,
see if he starts coming back up.

503
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,646
- Did we miss any bleeders?
- Surgical field is clear.

504
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,312
- Agonal rhythm.
- Any pulse with that?

505
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,879
- No carotid.
- Starting CPR. Push one of epi.

506
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,653
No extraordinary measures, Dr. Bailey.
He's DNR.

507
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,718
No, this is just good medicine.

508
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:42,755
Blue urine?

509
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:45,803
A second drug screen was positive
for amitriptyline,

510
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:49,670
which, I'm sure you know,
causes ventricular arrhythmias.

511
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,766
You knew it wouldn't show
on a drug screen,

512
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:54,607
but I'm guessing
you didn't realize it turns urine blue.

513
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:59,241
I didn't do this to myself.
You have to believe me. I'm sick.

514
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:02,844
- I have something...
- No. You're just deceiving yourself.

515
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:07,688
Manufacturing things that really aren't
there, seeing only what you want to see.

516
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,991
Wasting our time, our resources,
and throwing away your own life.

517
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,498
Your illness is in your head, Kalpana.

518
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,556
We will be transferring you to Psych.

519
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:22,731
Come on.

520
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:27,538
Come on, don't give up. Come on.

521
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,308
You're getting tired.
Let me take over, Dr. Bailey.

522
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:43,054
Dr. Bailey, his intestines are
cyanotic. There's no blood circulating.

523
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:47,120
It's been shunted to his brain where he
needs it. You call those compressions?

524
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:56,769
Fight it. Come on!

525
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:06,308
Why isn't anyone moving?
Who's recording?

526
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:09,615
It's been ten minutes
since we had a perfusing rhythm.

527
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:11,314
It's your call, Dr. Bailey.

528
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,619
One, two, three...

529
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,633
Asystole.

530
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:38,875
Time of death: 19:26.

531
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:39,408
It's hard to accept the end
when you're too close.

532
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:57,319
Look, I don't want someone
who doesn't want me, Meredith.

533
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:02,833
But if there's the slightest chance
that he does, I'm not leaving Seattle.

534
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:09,804
What did she tell them?

535
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:12,342
That you cheated on her,
that she was drunk,

536
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,810
and you were cleaning your guns
in the kitchen.

537
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:18,315
- I'm not gonna press charges.
- It doesn't matter, she confessed.

538
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:21,442
- Assault in the first degree.
- They arrested her?

539
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,646
Man, you should be grateful.

540
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,313
You know what I am?

541
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:27,323
I'm stupid.

542
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:30,622
Nothing is more stupid
than cheating on the woman you love.

543
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,163
You don't know what you're missing.

544
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:49,780
Your latte's by your bed,
and I'm pretty sure it's cold.

545
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:52,645
- I don't need it.
- You should be in bed.

546
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:57,586
Stop it. I'm fine, OK? My brain is fine.
My body is fine. I'm fine.

547
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,385
- I don't know why I came.
- Then why did you?

548
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,926
You know, I... Just stop it. I don't...

549
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:07,454
I'm sorry I'm not that person. I'm sorry
I don't need you here taking care of me.

550
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:09,994
Well?

551
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:13,503
You were right. Kalpana definitely
suffers from Munchausen's.

552
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,869
See. I was right.

553
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,299
I was right.

554
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,104
I was right.

555
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:28,282
I was right. I was...
I was right.

556
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,616
I was right.

557
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,679
Oh, I'm...

558
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,519
I'm right...

559
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,957
I'm right... I'm...

560
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:48,935
You took the Clinical Skills section of
your medical exams after most interns,

561
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:51,531
so the results are only now coming out.

562
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:54,009
I got a call from USMLE this morning.

563
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:00,110
Oh.

564
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:02,209
So you're saying...

565
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:05,778
Karev, you're still an MD.
You still get to practice medicine.

566
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,791
The hospital grants you four months
to retake the exam.

567
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:11,657
You study it, you pass it,
you put it behind you.

568
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,254
One misstep doesn't affect your career.

569
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:16,425
Right, thanks. Thanks.

570
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:22,328
What happens if I take the exam
for a second time and I don't pass?

571
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,398
You will no longer be
a surgical resident at Seattle Grace.

572
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,467
Failing again is not an option.

573
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:07,216
- What's going on?
- I can't stop. I can't... I can't stop.

574
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,253
Crying. She can't stop crying.

575
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,083
I can see that. What did you do to her?

576
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,588
Nothing.

577
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:16,115
She's going to dehydrate.
Cristina, do you want some water?

578
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,819
No. No.

579
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,195
No!

580
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,463
I already tried that.
It just made it worse.

581
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:27,561
I knew she'd break sooner or later.
Just a matter of time.

582
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,129
I will kill her!

583
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:32,402
I am her mother.

584
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:36,503
We don't do well with mothers here.
Why don't you leave and come back later?

585
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:40,216
Cristina.

586
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:43,481
Make it stop. Make it stop.

587
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:48,583
Somebody sedate me!

588
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:55,657
<i> Sometimes reality has a way</i>
<i>of sneaking up and biting us in the ass.</i>

589
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:02,002
<i>And when the dam bursts</i>
<i>all you can do is swim.</i>

590
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:11,304
<i>The world of pretend is a cage,</i>
<i>not a cocoon.</i>

591
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,446
<i>We can only lie to ourselves</i>
<i>for so long.</i>

592
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,662
<i>We are tired. We are scared.</i>

593
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:39,209
<i>Denying it doesn't change the truth.</i>

594
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:53,449
Hi, Mrs. Tate?

595
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:56,015
It's Miranda. Miranda Bailey.

596
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,594
I'm calling about Jeremiah.

597
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,299
I'm so sorry.

598
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,436
She doesn't want to be touched.

599
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:18,940
<i> Sooner or later,</i>
<i>we have to put aside our denial</i>

600
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:24,475
<i>and face the world head-on,</i>
<i>guns blazing.</i>

601
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,480
- Hi.
- Hey.

602
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:36,025
- You look great.
- Thanks.

603
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:38,755
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, you ready to go?

604
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:43,422
Yeah, you just...
You don't seem like yourself.

605
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:48,461
No. Look, we got dinner reservations.
We should go so, let's go.

606
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:49,904
OK.

607
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:55,606
<i> Denial. It's not just a river</i>
<i>in Egypt. It's a freaking ocean.</i>

608
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,774
I'm glad we're doing this.

609
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,147
Me too. Want a drink?

610
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:03,209
- Yes. Oh...
- That's OK, I got it.

611
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,278
I'll get it.

612
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:17,564
<i> So how do you</i>
<i>keep from drowning in it?</i>
