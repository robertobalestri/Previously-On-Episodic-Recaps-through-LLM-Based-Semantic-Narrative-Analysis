00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,094
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,500
I have a feeling.

3
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:07,699
- What kind of feeling?
- Like I might die.

4
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:10,140
Hello? Clearly not my dream.

5
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:14,846
My contractions are ten minutes apart
and my water just broke on your shoes.

6
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:17,212
- Can't we use first names?
- I don't think so.

7
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,274
I can't remember our last kiss?

8
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,286
Where... is my husband?

9
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,652
Got into a car accident
getting to the birth.

10
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:27,284
- Is my wife here?
- There's not going to be a baby today!

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,351
Meredith and Cristina are doers.

12
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:30,418
They're doers.

13
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,294
I'm horny, I'm half-naked.

14
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,892
You want to talk metaphors
or do you want to take off your pants?

15
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,995
A quiet board means trouble.
A quiet board is death.

16
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,300
Hannah. Hannah Davies.

17
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,671
Why do you have your hand
inside my patient?

18
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:45,472
My husband has to go
and stand in front of his big gun.

19
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,376
He shot himself with a bazooka?

20
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,415
- Was there an explosion?
- No.

21
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:52,178
I'm touching live unexploded ammunition?

22
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:56,348
Ten minutes ago the operating rooms
at Seattle Grace were evacuated

23
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:59,483
- except Dr. Burke's team.
- And Dr. Shepherd's team.

24
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,357
I can't leave Bailey's husband
with his skull flap open.

25
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:06,559
Pink mist. That's what the bomb squad
calls you when you blow up.

26
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,066
Dylan Young, bomb squad.

27
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:11,035
That device is homemade
which means it's unstable.

28
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,571
I am 22 years old.

29
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,072
We need to clear the room.

30
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,573
This is a mistake.

31
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,200
Calm down.

32
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,781
What did I do? What did I do?

33
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,849
<i>In hospitals, they say you know.</i>

34
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:29,687
<i>You know when you're going to die.</i>

35
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,391
<i>Some doctors say</i>
<i>it's a look patients get in their eyes.</i>

36
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:40,358
<i>Some say there's a scent,</i>
<i>the smell of death.</i>

37
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,960
<i>Some think</i>
<i>there's just some kind of sixth sense.</i>

38
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:48,098
<i>When the great beyond</i>
<i>is heading for you, you feel it coming.</i>

39
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,570
<i>Whatever it is, it's creepy.</i>

40
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:54,135
<i>Because if you know,</i>

41
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,682
<i>what do you do about it?</i>

42
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:00,477
<i>Forget about the fact</i>
<i>that you're scared out of your mind.</i>

43
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,755
<i>If you knew</i>
<i>this was your last day on Earth,</i>

44
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,558
<i>how would you want to spend it?</i>

45
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:20,802
- What's going on?
- Uh, something happened in OR Three.

46
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,774
- What?
- I don't know.

47
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:25,606
All I know is Hannah,
the paramedic, she's missing.

48
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,677
Chief? What's happened?

49
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,648
A quiet board.
A quiet board is what's happened.

50
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,216
Dr. Shepherd?

51
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,325
Dr. Burke.

52
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,332
How's it going?

53
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,800
He's got a second bleed
under the skull base.

54
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,336
If I do what the textbooks say,

55
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:54,373
he could lose the power of speech,
herniate and die.

56
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,840
- What's your other option?
- If I do what I want,

57
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,176
he could lose the power of speech,

58
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,043
herniate and die.

59
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,548
Well, good luck with that.

60
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,106
Thanks.

61
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:10,354
Is there something you want?

62
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:15,050
You know, it was really stupid
of you not to evacuate.

63
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,119
- You, too.
- Yeah, I know.

64
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,131
We should consider a new profession.

65
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,259
Yes, we should.

66
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,862
Now, can you operate
and remove the device from the guy?

67
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,974
After the bomb squad is through
assessing him, I'm going to try.

68
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,548
I don't want to be the guy
that kills Bailey's husband.

69
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,054
I don't want to be the guy
that kills us all.

70
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,891
- Dr. Shepherd.
- Dr. Burke.

71
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,569
You realize how stupid that was?

72
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,737
- It was, incredibly stupid.
- I don't need to be made fun of

73
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,873
when I have my hand inside
a body that's got a bomb in it

74
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:13,214
and a stranger is Velcro-ing
a flak jacket to my boobs.

75
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,311
You've got a sense of irony.

76
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:18,050
Only when things are really ironic.

77
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,518
I had a feeling.

78
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,565
What's that?

79
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,293
Nothing.

80
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,158
- Time for you to go.
- No, I'm staying.

81
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:58,823
There's nothing more you can do here.
We got it covered.

82
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:02,026
Cristina,
this is not another cool surgery.

83
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,170
This ammo can go off any time
and kill everyone.

84
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,502
Do you get that?
You cannot be in here.

85
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:11,100
- Do you think this is about surgery?
- I cannot do this with you here.

86
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,072
I cannot think.

87
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,750
We'll be fine.

88
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,518
It's OK.

89
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,727
You know in the movies
how there's always the hero

90
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,432
and then there's the other guy?

91
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,998
You know the guy who sees danger
and runs in the opposite direction?

92
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,066
Yes.

93
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,442
Be the other guy.

94
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:17,876
So, you have a plan, right?
You have a way to get me out of this?

95
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:36,517
I feel colors are brighter.
Does anyone feel colors are brighter?

96
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,962
- My head hurts.
- It's the adrenaline.

97
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,693
- Do you have the smell thing? I have...
- Shut up!

98
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,933
- Are you OK?
- Of course not.

99
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,440
How could she be OK?
You're insensitive.

100
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,773
- I am not insensitive.
- Would you shut up!

101
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:55,405
Nobody cares if the blue is bluer
or if you have super smelling powers.

102
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:59,815
Meredith could die.
Any minute she could just... die.

103
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:03,120
Actually stop living.

104
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,179
Dead.

105
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,448
Corpse.

106
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,802
Look, I'm sorry.

107
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:22,500
God, I have really inappropriate
reactions to this kind of stress.

108
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,236
I'm sorry. Hold on.

109
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,876
- OK?
- Yeah.

110
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,007
Should we like... do something?

111
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,314
- I mean, call Meredith's family?
- We are Meredith's family.

112
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:37,918
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,723
We are Meredith's family.

114
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,374
- This area's been evacuated, Dr. Yang.
- And somehow you're still here.

115
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:01,845
- I have to be here. You don't.
- Yes I do.

116
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,075
- Dr. Yang.
- Yes I do!

117
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,312
Besides, I...
I'm guessing you need a little company.

118
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,828
- How's he doing?
- He's hanging in there.

119
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,833
- How's the paramedic Hannah doing?
- Hannah?

120
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,698
The girl with the bomb.

121
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,169
Oh, uh, she's hanging in there, too.

122
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,835
- Calm down.
- Calm down?

123
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,107
I have an evacuated OR,
a bomb in a body cavity,

124
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,877
a missing paramedic, an intern
with her hand on the explosive,

125
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,111
two world-class surgeons in harm's way,

126
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,677
a man on a table
who may bleed out any moment

127
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,189
unless we remove the bomb from his chest

128
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:49,627
and my favorite resident in labor who
you are now telling me refuses to push.

129
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,720
Really? Calm down?

130
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:55,233
- You really want me to calm down?
- OK, don't calm down.

131
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,202
Dr. Bailey is scared, sir.
It's a day to be scared.

132
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:03,735
She won't let me examine her but
her contractions are 40 seconds apart

133
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,709
and she is refusing to push.

134
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:09,145
The baby could go into distress
and if she doesn't come out of this,

135
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,581
I'll need an OR
to do an emergency C-section.

136
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,984
I can't give you an OR, Addie.
I don't have an OR to give.

137
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,045
Convince her. Bailey's rational.

138
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,182
She's not Bailey,
she's a woman in labor

139
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,920
whose husband is
in surgery next to a bomb.

140
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:25,327
- So is yours.
- This is about Bailey. I need an OR.

141
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:29,095
- I don't know what to tell you.
- Look, Richard, we have about an hour.

142
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:32,103
And then I'm going to need you
to get me an OR, build me an OR,

143
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:35,072
find me a helicopter to fly me
to any OR in the city.

144
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,269
Otherwise, instead of having a baby,
she'll be losing one.

145
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,015
- Here are the blueprints you asked for.
- Thank you.

146
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:07,036
I laugh at funerals.

147
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,074
I don't go to funerals.

148
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,577
Izzie. Iz.

149
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,623
I was jealous.

150
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:34,089
I was jealous of Meredith
and the surgery and I...

151
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,164
I... I was...

152
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,228
jealous, and now...

153
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,166
I was jealous, Alex.

154
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,590
Is this the strangest thing
to happen in your OR?

155
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:09,595
- I'd have to say that it is.
- Good, because I'm very competitive.

156
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,365
All the best surgeons are.

157
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,043
Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd
talked to the chief.

158
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,205
She's on the phone with Mercy West now

159
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:26,183
- to see if they have any ORs.
- I need someone to drive me home.

160
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,516
They're talking about doing a C-section.

161
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:31,112
Let them talk.
I'm not going to Mercy West.

162
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,784
This baby is not coming out.
I need a ride.

163
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,225
I can't focus enough to drive myself

164
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,626
and Tucker...

165
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,193
- I need a ride.
- You could lose it.

166
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,031
I told you, I'm not having this baby
until tomorrow.

167
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:47,402
- It could die before it's even born!
- Can you give me a ride home?

168
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,567
- Dr. Bailey...
- Then get out!

169
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,688
Is there any news?

170
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,226
What? Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Carlson.

171
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:21,205
My husband. I was wondering
if there was any news.

172
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,400
Because you look so worried.

173
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,910
And I heard this doctor saying

174
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:29,345
even though that girl has
her finger on the tear in his heart...

175
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,748
that my husband's losing... blood.

176
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,844
Every second he's losing blood.

177
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,754
Which means he could die.

178
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,382
He could die?

179
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,792
I ask because
I know you'll tell me the truth.

180
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,387
Because you look so worried.

181
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,898
Mrs. Carlson...

182
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:56,401
Yes, it's possible that he could bleed
out and die if we don't operate soon.

183
00:12:58,744 --> 00:12:59,733
OK.

184
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:04,705
OK.

185
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,909
Thank you for telling me the truth.

186
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:11,311
I'll just...

187
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,651
I'll just go wait... over here.

188
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,159
Will somebody get me an update?

189
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,721
And where's the head of the bomb squad?

190
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,325
I'm right here.
And we're good to go.

191
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,461
My team's in place, Dr. Burke is ready.

192
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,062
The patient is stable.

193
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,267
We can have the bomb out
in ten minutes if I'm not interrupted.

194
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,578
In the OR we put our patients
under general anesthesia.

195
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,412
- Yeah.
- That involves a steady flow of oxygen.

196
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44,148
Well, can't you turn off
the oxygen to my OR?

197
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,282
I can and I have.

198
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,156
But... this is your OR.

199
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,755
This is the OR floor's main oxygen line.

200
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,204
It's going to be OK.

201
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,679
- You don't know that.
- It's just what you say.

202
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,039
I know.

203
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,552
- Where you going?
- I can't just...

204
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,557
I got to do something to help.

205
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,087
Thank you...
for saying that it's going to be OK.

206
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,455
Even if it is just what you say.

207
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,740
Stop it.

208
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,813
- I'm not a patient.
- What?

209
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,786
You two are looking at me
the way we look at patients.

210
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,879
Like I'm going to freak out any minute.

211
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:54,323
I'm not going to freak out so,
whatever it is, just tell me.

212
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,568
The main oxygen line
runs directly under this room.

213
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:04,898
OK.

214
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,706
Not OK?

215
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,231
Well?

216
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:15,872
I need one of you to tell me
what this means exactly.

217
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,416
Because I think I know what it means,

218
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,112
but I tend to be
"glass half empty" these days,

219
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,347
so I won't trust what I think it means.

220
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,357
Because I think it means
that if the bomb were to explode

221
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:30,589
over the oxygen line,
the whole hospital could blow up.

222
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,259
And that's just crazy, right?

223
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,368
I need an answer
on when they're going to start moving.

224
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,431
- Look, I'm busy.
- I know.

225
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,773
I know you are,
but if there was something,

226
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,677
anything we could do to help,
it would be very helpful.

227
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,339
We need an assignment, sir.

228
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,852
- Look, I need...
- Chief?

229
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,410
- He's full-on diaphoretic.
- Check his pulse.

230
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:58,820
- We need help.
- Let's move!

231
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:02,258
- I'll get a wheelchair.
- I think it's a heart attack.

232
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,166
Meredith, all it means...

233
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:13,130
- is that we have to move.
- Move?

234
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,866
That's right. We have to move.

235
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,500
I don't want to spend
another second here.

236
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:21,842
Wait. I can't wiggle my fingers
because we can't shift the ammo,

237
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,382
and now you want to roll out
the entire gurney?

238
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,476
Well, that's our safest, safest option.

239
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,487
So we move. Not a problem.
We can do this.

240
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,993
- You handling this, Grey?
- I'm handling this.

241
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:40,193
- So how's it look?
- Hard to say. EKG is normal.

242
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,529
- That's good news.
- I'm getting up.

243
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:45,399
Sir, you should wait
until we get the blood work back.

244
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,338
- I'm not listening.
- You can talk to me, Dr. Stevens.

245
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,130
Um...

246
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,000
Um...

247
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,640
OK.

248
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,648
Your husband should really wait

249
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:00,276
until we get the blood work back
for confirmation.

250
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,513
OK, out! Both of you!

251
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,620
- I'm getting up.
- You have to body-check me to do so.

252
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,092
Adele, there is a bomb!

253
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,560
I heard.

254
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,042
Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd?

255
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,038
What are we going to do?
I mean, about Dr. Bailey.

256
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,015
Can we drug her?

257
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:36,077
- Against her will?
- No. Well... yes.

258
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,719
I mean, can't we force her to push?

259
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,694
lf... Declare her temporarily insane?

260
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:50,866
You want me to declare Miranda Bailey,
Miranda... Bailey, incompetent?

261
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,364
Do you think that will help?

262
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,171
Do you think it will make her more
inclined, comfortable giving birth?

263
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,234
- I don't know.
- Do you think I'm not doing

264
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,007
everything I can to help her?

265
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,847
Do you think I'm just out here
because I needed a little me-time?

266
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,614
- I'm just asking.
- Stop asking!

267
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,019
No matter what you ask,
I don't know.

268
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:15,186
I am doing everything I can.
Everything I can.

269
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,957
Miranda Bailey's husband is
in mortal danger, actual mortal danger.

270
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,965
There's not a lot I can say
to comfort her

271
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,968
because there's not a lot
anybody can say to comfort me.

272
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,971
I'm doing my best.
Dr. Bailey is doing her best.

273
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,940
And I need you to do your best
and I need it to be better

274
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:33,739
than standing here asking me
the world's stupidest questions!

275
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,007
I don't know, O'Malley!

276
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,842
Hey.

277
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,505
You OK?

278
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,680
Wait, are you bleeding?

279
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,012
I... I think I fell.

280
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,548
I was... I was running and, um...
and I fell.

281
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,323
It... It's OK.

282
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,359
Are you Hannah?

283
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,598
Yeah.

284
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,600
Microscissors, Dr. Yang.

285
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,141
What is so interesting out there?

286
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,647
I, um, I'II...

287
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,601
You're doing great.

288
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,663
Let's go over it again.

289
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:13,268
The device is shaped like a rocket
about eight inches long.

290
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,746
We'll have everything ready,
Dr. Burke's team will be in place,

291
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,976
my team will be in place.

292
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,509
Then I'm going to ask you to take
the hand that you have in Mr. Carlson

293
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,357
and wrap it around the device.

294
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,484
- And pull it out.
- Level.

295
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,721
Pull it out while keeping it level.

296
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,160
You know, I don't like you very much.

297
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,796
I don't like you, either.

298
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:43,170
- What are you doing?
- Stop where you are.

299
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,211
- What are you doing?
- Dr. Burke told you to leave.

300
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:51,511
We're moving to an OR further away from
the oxygen line. In case we blow up.

301
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,177
I remember him telling you to leave.

302
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,744
- Where is he?
- He's prepping the OR.

303
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,617
Then he'll never know, will he?

304
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,755
You stay over there.

305
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,059
You stay over there.

306
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:16,463
You ready?

307
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,181
- Tell me something.
- What?

308
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:30,654
Cristina, I have my hand on a bomb,
I'm freaking out.

309
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:35,125
And most importantly,
I really have to pee. Tell me anything.

310
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,656
He told me he loved me. Last night.

311
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,758
He thought I was sleeping, but I heard.

312
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,530
Burke loves you.

313
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:48,334
Yeah. Mind your own business.

314
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:54,471
- Burke loves you.
- Yeah, everybody has problems.

315
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,112
- Well, are you going to say it back?
- Of course not.

316
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,619
He didn't say it to me,
only to the sleeping me.

317
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,679
Reciprocity is not required.

318
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,156
- Besides, he might blow up.
- Excellent point.

319
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,067
All right, everybody.

320
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,403
Let's just keep placing
one foot in front of the other.

321
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,147
Nice and slow.

322
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,979
- Meredith, we're almost there.
- OK.

323
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:35,212
We're almost there.
Nice and easy. Ready?

324
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,983
- Yep.
- All right, let's go.

325
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:40,286
Nice and slow.

326
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,997
You had to say
you were going to die today?

327
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:51,759
I told you.

328
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:03,212
It's not too deep, but you are
going to need a couple of stitches.

329
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:09,514
Hannah, is there someone
you would like me to call?

330
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,421
Family? Or maybe... a friend?

331
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,661
That doctor...

332
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,721
Dr. Grey? Meredith.

333
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,230
- Is she...?
- She's still there.

334
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,736
- So she's still alive?
- She's alive.

335
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,607
She's still alive.

336
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:39,212
Dr. Milton shouldn't have left you.

337
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:42,014
- He's a coward.
- I'm a coward.

338
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,248
- No.
- I ran away.

339
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:49,319
You think you're going to be different.

340
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:53,421
You think you're going to be the kind
of person who stays and does something.

341
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,930
You know, a good man in the storm.

342
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,936
I'm a paramedic.

343
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:02,565
I'm supposed to stay and do something.
I'm not supposed to run away.

344
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,604
I'm not supposed to hide
under the stairs

345
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:09,078
because I left two people to die.

346
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:13,549
I'm supposed to stay and do something.

347
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,812
I ran away.

348
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,890
Well, blood work's back.

349
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,055
The chief had an anxiety attack.

350
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,598
Who's going to tell him?

351
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,830
Um... I gave you sex
in the linen closet. You tell him.

352
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,632
Fair enough.

353
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:39,107
OK, Dr. Bailey. Let's go.

354
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,806
Dr. Bailey, I need you to turn
on your back. I need you to push.

355
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,851
Leave me alone.

356
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,416
Miranda...

357
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,514
I can't let her go any longer.

358
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:56,755
I'll go tell Richard
that he has to give us an OR, OK?

359
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:03,327
Dr. Bailey, I'm surprised at you. This
is not how I thought you would do this.

360
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,266
Dr. O'Malley, I don't think...

361
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,271
I truly...

362
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,001
- I expected more.
- George.

363
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,948
You're Dr. Bailey.

364
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,184
You don't hide from a fight.

365
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,787
You don't give up.

366
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,463
You strive for greatness.

367
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,356
You...

368
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:39,460
Dr. Bailey... you are a doer.

369
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,471
I know your husband's not here

370
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,274
and I know there are
a lot of things going on here

371
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:50,644
that we have no control over.

372
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,376
But this...

373
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,113
This...

374
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,195
we can do.

375
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:08,454
OK?

376
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:14,861
OK.

377
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,228
Let's have this baby.

378
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:52,808
We're ready when you are.

379
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:54,640
We're good. Meredith?

380
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,437
Yeah.

381
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,811
I'm going to extend the wound.

382
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:02,614
When I cut,
the bleeding is going to intensify.

383
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:06,418
If we're going to save Mr. Carlson,
you must pull the ammo out immediately.

384
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:10,655
But remember: Remove it
while keeping it as level as possible.

385
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,527
Nice and easy.
No quick movements.

386
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:14,826
Level.

387
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:16,833
Right. Level.

388
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:17,959
You ready?

389
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,169
I, uh...

390
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,468
- Do I have a choice?
- You have to be ready.

391
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:32,382
Yeah. I guess...

392
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,244
Scalpel.

393
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,116
I guess I'm ready.

394
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,994
- How's it going, Yang?
- Everything's fine.

395
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,899
- How's the girl with the bomb?
- How's he doing?

396
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,938
He's almost there. Can you suction?
Irrigate. Great.

397
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,200
- You didn't answer my question.
- Sir?

398
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,367
How is the girl with the bomb?

399
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:04,377
It's Meredith.
The girl with the bomb is Meredith.

400
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,129
I'm good. She can go.

401
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,059
All right, now, Meredith...

402
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,067
wrap your hand around the nose cone.

403
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,373
Meredith.

404
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:32,131
Grey?

405
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:36,703
Grey?

406
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,146
We're losing him. Push one of epi.

407
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,984
- Thready pulse.
- Epi in.

408
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,218
- Get me a wet lap.
- Here.

409
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,193
Roll him on three. Everybody ready?

410
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:51,523
Ready? We got to go!

411
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:52,722
Come on, let's go!

412
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:56,998
Meredith?

413
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,366
George and Izzie
shouldn't have to move out.

414
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,034
No. You hear me...

415
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,134
You should make sure...

416
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,940
make sure that they...

417
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:10,276
they get to stay in the house.

418
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,146
- Good.
- Push.

419
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,846
- Push.
- Just a little bit more.

420
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,320
- I can see the top of the head.
- I got to stop.

421
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:20,789
- And stop.
- OK, that was good.

422
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,884
That was very good. That was...

423
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:25,521
OK, are you ready?

424
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,586
- Ready?
- OK.

425
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:27,722
Push.

426
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:34,403
Come on, come on.

427
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:38,340
- Wide complex bradycardia.
- One of epi and of atropine.

428
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,536
Come on, come on.
You can't do this, Tucker!

429
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,375
You cannot quit on me. Come on.

430
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,608
- In.
- Grey?

431
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:46,741
His pressure's dropping.

432
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:47,944
Grey?

433
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:50,613
Look, I can't. No.
I can't. This is crazy.

434
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,986
Burke, you're gonna go. You go.

435
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:55,252
- Both of you.
- Nobody's dying today, Grey.

436
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:58,261
I want you to look at me.

437
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:59,921
Look at me.

438
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,691
I know this is bad.

439
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:07,636
I know that I'm this ass
who's been yelling at you all day.

440
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:09,263
So you pretend that I'm not.

441
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,674
You pretend that I'm someone you like.
Whatever you need.

442
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,906
But you need to listen to me.

443
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,493
- I'm scared.
- I know.

444
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,707
You can do this.

445
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,767
It'll be over in a second.

446
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,172
You can do this, Meredith.

447
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,342
OK.

448
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:58,945
OK.

449
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:17,771
Gently.

450
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,756
Good. A little bit more.

451
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,160
Good. Stop.

452
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,663
Stop?

453
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,724
Oh, Dr. Bailey,
I can see the top of his head.

454
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:45,564
He's got a lot of hair.

455
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:48,333
- Oh, he's cute.
- O'Malley.

456
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,170
Stop looking at my vah-jay-jay!

457
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,841
Yes, ma'am.

458
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,775
Out of the way!

459
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:05,641
You did good.

460
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,012
What the hell is happening?
Who's coming up?

461
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:45,905
OK.

462
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,749
Come on, sweetheart.

463
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,254
All right, people! They're coming up!

464
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:53,017
Mrs. Carlson...

465
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,922
- Derek.
- Preston.

466
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,659
Dr. Burke.

467
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,219
Is my husband, um...

468
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,827
...alive?
- Yes.

469
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:43,173
Is he going to stay alive?

470
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:49,580
Thanks to that young lady over there,
he is.

471
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,075
Thank you.

472
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:01,747
Thank you.

473
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,290
Thank you.

474
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:26,105
- Where is she?
- You had to be a cowboy.

475
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:30,186
Where is she?

476
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:32,017
She's right here.

477
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:33,681
Derek!

478
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,487
You're OK.

479
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:40,056
You're OK.

480
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:48,129
That is not the "she" he was asking for.

481
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,069
Burke?

482
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:06,813
You awake? Burke.

483
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,791
I love you, too.

484
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:33,308
This is our son.

485
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:37,336
William George Bailey Jones.

486
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:49,350
Hello, my little man.

487
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:50,416
Hello.

488
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,655
He's beautiful.

489
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:13,182
There's someone at the door for you.

490
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:24,856
Hey.

491
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,521
Hey.

492
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,603
You almost died today.

493
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,936
Yeah. I almost died today.

494
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:48,642
I can't...

495
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:56,025
I can't remember our last kiss.

496
00:39:56,761 --> 00:40:00,094
All I could think about was,
"I can't remember our last kiss,"

497
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:03,497
which is pathetic, but...

498
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:07,099
the last time
we were together and happy, I...

499
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,934
want to be able to remember that.

500
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,403
And I can't, Derek.

501
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,637
I can't remember it.

502
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,117
I'm glad you didn't die today.

503
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,726
It was a Thursday morning.

504
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:44,471
You were wearing that ratty little
Dartmouth t-shirt you look so good in.

505
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:47,409
The one with the hole
in the back of the neck.

506
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:53,545
You'd just washed your hair
and you smelled like some kind of...

507
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,244
flower.

508
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,258
I was running late for surgery.

509
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:04,886
You said you were going to see me later.

510
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,430
Then you leaned to me.

511
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:09,193
You put your hand on my chest...

512
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:13,235
and you kissed me.

513
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,293
Soft.

514
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:19,042
It was quick.
Kind of like a habit.

515
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:22,510
You know, like we'd do it every day
for the rest of our lives.

516
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:28,675
You went back to reading the newspaper
and I went to work.

517
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,846
That was the last time we kissed.

518
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,148
Lavender.

519
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:43,263
