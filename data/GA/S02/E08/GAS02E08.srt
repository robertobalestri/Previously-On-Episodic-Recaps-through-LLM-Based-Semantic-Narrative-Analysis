1
00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:02,194
<i> Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:03,257
Her or me?

3
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:05,770
I need him to stop talking to Meredith.

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,932
- You're staying with her?
- She's my wife.

5
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,134
I broke up with Derek.

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,101
- So where are we?
- We are a couple.

7
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:17,275
I know the rules, but I don't want
to have a relationship in secret.

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,942
Boys are stupid.

9
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,383
- What, you got a date?
- Yes, yes I do.

10
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:25,447
- You're married?
- Ten years today.

11
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,688
- How come I didn't know?
- You never asked.

12
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,028
<i> In the eighth grade,</i>

13
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:39,503
<i>my English class</i>
<i>had to read</i> Romeo and Juliet.

14
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:44,771
<i>Then, for extra credit, Mrs. Snyder</i>
<i>made us act out all the parts.</i>

15
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,908
<i>Sal Scafarillo was Romeo.</i>

16
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:55,585
<i>As fate would have it, I was Juliet.</i>

17
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:10,098
<i>All the other girls were jealous.</i>
<i>But I had a slightly different take.</i>

18
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,003
<i>I told Mrs. Snyder</i>
<i>that Juliet was an idiot.</i>

19
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:21,441
<i>For starters, she falls for the one guy</i>
<i>she knows she can't have.</i>

20
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:24,540
<i>Then she blames fate</i>
<i>for her own bad decision.</i>

21
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,551
- You kissed me.
- I did.

22
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:37,085
Should we... There's a discussion we
could have if you wanted to have one.

23
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:43,068
Izzie. I kissed you. With tongue.
And I plan to do it again and again.

24
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,832
Get used to it. End of discussion.

25
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:51,774
OK.

26
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:55,781
<i>Mrs. Snyder explained to me</i>
<i>that when fate comes into play,</i>

27
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,909
<i>choice sometimes goes out the window.</i>

28
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,213
God.

29
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,656
Congratulations.

30
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,888
- What?
- Fellowships.

31
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,295
Five applications, five offers.

32
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:15,027
Do you know how rare that is?
This is your year.

33
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,092
Everybody wants to dance with you.

34
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,628
Of course, Seattle Grace's
fellowship program is the best.

35
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:24,302
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

36
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,114
You are taking my fellowship,
aren't you?

37
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:36,121
I don't know.
I haven't made a decision yet.

38
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,750
<i>At the ripe old age of 13,</i>
<i>I was very clear</i>

39
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,727
<i>that love, like life,</i>
<i>is about making choices.</i>

40
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:46,629
I would not wish this on anyone.
It's like someone ripped my guts out.

41
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:51,864
- Baby, you had food poisoning.
- I had one, lousy restaurant clam.

42
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:57,436
- Wait a minute. Where's Billing again?
- The basement.

43
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,637
<i>And fate has nothing to do with it.</i>

44
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,839
We're going the wrong way.

45
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:08,078
- Coffee?
- Oh, thank you. It's date night.

46
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,812
Yeah, it's a night, with a date.

47
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,849
- You forgot.
- No.

48
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,757
Yes.

49
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,820
You want to cancel?

50
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,423
No.

51
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,741
<i>Everyone thinks it's so romantic.</i>

52
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:34,007
<i>Romeo and Juliet. True love. How sad.</i>

53
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,048
Oh, crap!

54
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:42,019
<i>If Juliet was stupid enough to fall for</i>
<i>the enemy, drink a bottle of poison,</i>

55
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,852
<i>and go to sleep in a mausoleum...</i>

56
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:45,913
What the...

57
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,085
<i>... she deserved whatever she got.</i>

58
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,260
Window washer,
fell from fifth-floor scaffolding.

59
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,822
Obvious open tib<i>l</i>fib fracture,
but otherwise OK.

60
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,733
After a five-story fall
he's got equal breath sounds.

61
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,998
This is unbelievable!
Do you want to hear?

62
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:37,008
Somehow I believe you. Yang,
get in there and palpate his abdomen.

63
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,067
- Does this hurt anywhere?
- No.

64
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:42,308
You fell from the sky. Five stories.
You only injured your leg.

65
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,577
- George.
- No. Don't "George" me.

66
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,983
A few seconds earlier,
he'd have landed on me.

67
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:50,079
OK, rolling on three, please.
One, two, three.

68
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:58,695
- Are these feathers?
- My life was saved by that pigeon.

69
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,562
Let's get some X-rays.

70
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:05,366
And after that you might want to get in
there and look for the rest of Tweety.

71
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,962
Thank you.

72
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,941
Esme wanted to wait until tomorrow
to see her doctor.

73
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:13,308
But she hasn't been able
to keep anything down since yesterday.

74
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,438
So I brought her in.

75
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:19,781
Mrs. Sorrento,
you have acute cholecystitis.

76
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,753
Which means that your gallbladder
may have to come out.

77
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,187
She has gallstones?

78
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,623
He watches cable.
He thinks he's a doctor.

79
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:33,662
I'm giving you antibiotics and IV fluids
to cool the gallbladder down.

80
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,462
Then I'm going to call Dr. Bailey

81
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:38,527
and I'm going to see if surgery
is the best way for us to go.

82
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:41,971
- Do you have any questions?
- What happened to your forehead?

83
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,834
Nothing.

84
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,278
I've told you.
I don't need an appointment.

85
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:52,409
I am not a patient.
I am a friend from New York.

86
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,509
Weiss?

87
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:56,316
Derek! I've been looking for you!

88
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,552
Sav, why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

89
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,591
If I knew you were coming
I would have taken a day off.

90
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,394
- It was kind of last minute.
- Are you all right?

91
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,969
A month ago, her mother died.
Ovarian cancer.

92
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,200
Catherine died?

93
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,976
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:22,142
And Savvy, she's...
I mean, you know how close they were.

95
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,981
I mean, all she can think about is this
breast and ovarian cancer gene.

96
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,383
BRACA.

97
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,457
A positive test result
isn't the end of the world, Sav.

98
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,255
It just means you have
a gene mutation that could...

99
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:36,659
I know what it is.

100
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,893
I've talked to the genetic counselor.
I've been to my gynecologist.

101
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,525
And now I'm here.

102
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,276
Addy, you're the best surgeon there is.

103
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,709
True.

104
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,373
- But this isn't surgical.
- Yes, it is.

105
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,715
No. Sav, you understand
you don't have cancer?

106
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,415
And I have no intention of getting it.

107
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,987
So you want me...

108
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,998
I want you to take out my ovaries
and the uterus,

109
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,534
and when that's done,

110
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:20,231
you're going to find me the best person
out there to cut off my breasts.

111
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,884
- Beak?
- Claw.

112
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,582
We need to widen this incision
to take a better look.

113
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:45,457
- Does your leg hurt a lot?
- I'm fine, man. Just do your thing.

114
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,294
Is there anyone you'd like me to call?

115
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,995
What for?

116
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,538
You fell five stories
and lived to tell about it.

117
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,541
I'd kind of want to shout it
from the rooftops.

118
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,171
So to speak.

119
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,703
It's a miracle. You may not understand
the medicine of it.

120
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:06,809
A five-story fall, your lungs should be
collapsed, your back should be broken.

121
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:10,151
- Your aorta should be totally severed.
- George, enough.

122
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:19,657
I'm just saying, you know,
there's a reason for this.

123
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,098
You lived. We both did.

124
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,427
<i>Carpe diem,</i> man. Seize the day.

125
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:32,207
- Any chance you can make him leave?
- I really, really wish I could.

126
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:37,375
Mr. Vargas,
your lower left leg bones are shattered.

127
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:42,717
- We'll need to get you in for surgery.
- Oh, great. Just my luck.

128
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,881
Beak!

129
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:48,085
Could I... Would you mind,
could I keep that?

130
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:53,990
My mother died of it, my aunt. My
cousin. She's 37, has ovarian cancer.

131
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,057
But you don't. You don't have cancer.

132
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,727
But I have the gene.

133
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:01,295
Which gives her up to an 85%% chance
of getting cancer, Weiss.

134
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,366
- And a 15%% chance she won't.
- I'm not betting my life on 15%%.

135
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,377
- Were you invited?
- Weiss asked me.

136
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,310
- I thought it might help.
- Help what?

137
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,645
I'm sorry, Derek,
I'm really glad to see you.

138
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,981
But until you grow a uterus
and watch your mother die from this,

139
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,580
- you don't get... you don't get a vote.
- Did she say they tried for a baby?

140
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,818
- She did.
- Having a hysterectomy is...

141
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,917
- Derek!
- We've tried for months.

142
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:25,122
- Why give up now?
- Come on, we've talked about this.

143
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:27,791
There are other ways to make a family.
We can adopt.

144
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:32,270
- Savvy, I just...
- No. No! I'm not talking about this.

145
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:39,401
Let's just take a step back. All right,
take a deep breath and think about this.

146
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:45,474
I've already thought about it, Derek.
This... This is going to happen.

147
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,543
Dr. Stevens, get a complete history
and do her pre-op labs.

148
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:52,785
Schedule her for a double-mastectomy and
consult Dr. Quenar for a reconstruction.

149
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,418
- Derek?
- Addison, this conversation isn't over.

150
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,257
She is my patient, Derek.

151
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,767
We're doing a bilateral prophylactic
oophorectomy and hysterectomy tomorrow.

152
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,734
Get moving.

153
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,428
Prophylactic surgery is extreme.

154
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,099
This has nothing to do with you.

155
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,474
She came to me for a medical
consultation, Derek. I'm her doctor.

156
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,446
Those are some of our closest friends.
This is personal.

157
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:18,574
Fine. If it's personal,
we should deal with them as a couple.

158
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,779
- Acting like a couple.
- What? What does that mean?

159
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:24,015
- See the ring?
- Don't go to the ring.

160
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,955
The ring, Derek. Remember?

161
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,493
When we're here at work,
you won't talk to me.

162
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,654
Or on the ferry,
you pretend not to see me.

163
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,463
Or in couple's therapy, where we argue
about whether we should be in therapy.

164
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,525
- What are we doing?
- It's not about us.

165
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:41,061
It is! Medicine aside, our friends
are going through hell in there,

166
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,598
and we can't even act like we like
each other long enough to help them.

167
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,281
What's that other animal
that's monogamous?

168
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,285
I think it's voles.

169
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,651
I know it's hard. I'm a pincushion.

170
00:10:56,722 --> 00:11:00,351
It's OK, don't worry.
I won't stick until I find a good one.

171
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,156
- Otters mate for life, you know.
- Excuse me?

172
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,630
As do voles, I suppose.

173
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:12,899
OK, I got it. Hold still, it's going
to take a second for the tube to fill.

174
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,769
I've always liked otters.

175
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,638
I've always been
more of a dog person myself.

176
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,975
Shouldn't he be more excited?

177
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,248
Maybe he's in shock. I don't know.
I mean, he survived. That's huge.

178
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,845
He's got to realize,
things happen for a reason.

179
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:35,292
Oh, yeah. My ex-boyfriend moved his wife
to Seattle. Reason? To torture me.

180
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,988
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

181
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:40,123
- What's with the Hello Kitty?
- I don't want to talk about it.

182
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,498
- Can I sign out to you early?
- You don't want in on Stu's surgery?

183
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:46,936
Can't. I have a test date.
Burke is testing me.

184
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:50,772
I've already spent an hour picking
bird parts out of the guy. I'm over it.

185
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:51,832
<i>Carpe diem.</i>

186
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:55,039
I have a zit on my forehead
and I am beginning to look how I feel.

187
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:59,141
- <i>Carpe</i> that.
- This is the luckiest day in the world.

188
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,651
Tell that to the bird.

189
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,891
Thank you.

190
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,053
Is it the kid thing?

191
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,597
I saw your face upstairs.

192
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,994
It's the kid thing for most people.

193
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,002
And the breasts.

194
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,267
Oh, and the total menopause,
like, overnight.

195
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,865
- It's a big step.
- I think it's brave.

196
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,342
Thank you.

197
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,402
And, yes, I'd love to be pregnant.

198
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,746
I want a lot of things. I want
to skydive. I'd like to learn Italian.

199
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:35,583
I want to go to St. Tropez with my
husband and lie topless on the beach.

200
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:38,179
They do excellent implants these days.

201
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:42,091
Won't even know the difference. Plus,
you'll never have to wear a bra again.

202
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,925
- That's something, right?
- Alex.

203
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:48,489
Didn't I see your service on the
OR board for a biopsy right about now?

204
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,034
Yeah.

205
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,406
- It's not the kid thing.
- OK, what?

206
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,009
It's not like I have a lot of options.

207
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,241
One, take my chances
and never get cancer.

208
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:06,443
- Two, take my chances and die young.
- There's a third option.

209
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,384
OK, I'm listening.

210
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:12,151
Take your chances, get cancer,
and fight like hell to survive.

211
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,424
Uh... They're both really nice.

212
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,092
I know. I bought them.
But which one is right?

213
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,728
For what?
You're going to look hot in either one.

214
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,329
Well, clearly. That's not the point.

215
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,805
You look hot.

216
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:32,275
Yeah. Burke and I are going to talk
about how hot I am over dinner.

217
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:36,212
- This date is such a mistake.
- It's easy to get nervous on dates.

218
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,716
It's especially hard
if you're out of practice.

219
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:42,185
- So, you just got to be mellow...
- I know how to date. I'm not you.

220
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,347
I have her scheduled for the mastectomy,

221
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:47,290
and I stay while Plastics
does a TRAM flap reconstruction.

222
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,020
- I couldn't do it.
- Do what?

223
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:52,552
Make yourself all hot and sexy
for your boyfriend like Yang?

224
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,121
Go wrestle something.

225
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,363
Cut off my ovaries and breasts
just 'cause I might have cancer.

226
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:58,596
Think of it like a hand.

227
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,266
If you knew you'd die if you didn't
chop off your hand, you'd do it.

228
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,833
Except when you chop off a hand,
you don't kill your sex drive,

229
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:10,041
have silicone breasts, get hot flashes,
and lose your ability to bear children.

230
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,606
I wouldn't have the test.
What's the point?

231
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,347
We're all going to die anyway, right?

232
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,821
It's the Hello Kitty Band-Aid
on my head. It's freaking me out.

233
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,859
I say slice 'em and dice 'em.
They're body parts.

234
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,727
- So you'd cut off your penis?
- If it kept me from dying.

235
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,791
Besides, I've got plenty to spare.

236
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,664
I can do hot in my sleep.

237
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,040
I look hot in scrubs. I'm a hot person.

238
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:45,244
- He's seen me naked 1,000 times.
- Bad, bad images in my head.

239
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,808
But he's never seen you
outside the hospital.

240
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,112
Thank you.

241
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,687
You look lovely.

242
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,023
Thanks.

243
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:05,425
Oh.

244
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,232
Very polite. Thank you.

245
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:25,256
OK, Grey. Adhesions are down.
What next?

246
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,657
Put in graspers to lift the gallbladder
so we can dissect it out.

247
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:32,288
Good. And what are we
looking for in Calot's triangle?

248
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,922
The cystic artery.

249
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:39,301
That's right. Wait a minute.
What do you see?

250
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,601
Porcelain gallbladder.

251
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,938
That's not good.

252
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:51,642
Mr. Sorrento,
when we removed your wife's gallbladder,

253
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:54,083
we found that there were calcifications.

254
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,620
What does that mean?

255
00:15:55,688 --> 00:16:01,149
It's often a sign of gallbladder cancer.
We sent it off to Pathology.

256
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,496
- She has cancer?
- I'm afraid so.

257
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,227
We can keep her comfortable,

258
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,532
but she's going to need more tests
to see what our next steps are.

259
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,936
This might include more surgery.

260
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,072
But this surgery will save her, right?

261
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,203
The cancer appears to be advanced.

262
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,874
There are palliative surgeries
we can do.

263
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:28,409
That is, surgeries to help with
the pain, but it won't cure it.

264
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,023
How long has she got?

265
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:38,029
From what we can tell so far,
she has about four to six months.

266
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,633
I'm so sorry.

267
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,672
I don't want Esme to know.

268
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,343
- What?
- Esme.

269
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,971
- I don't want her to know she's dying.
- You don't want to tell her?

270
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:59,245
Please. You saw her. She's happy.

271
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,779
Let me take her home.

272
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:07,952
I don't want her to be afraid before
she dies. She doesn't need to know.

273
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,399
No, please don't.

274
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:24,408
No more <i>carpe diem,</i> man.
I don't want to seize the day.

275
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:25,704
That's what I don't get.

276
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,906
I'm standing here, and I'm just
incredibly happy to be alive.

277
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:33,145
I'm looking at the sky, it's bluer,
food tastes better,

278
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,085
and I didn't survive a five-story fall.

279
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,829
You jumped, didn't you?

280
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,610
The whole way down,
all I could think about was Daisy.

281
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,411
She's my ex-girl.
She works in this hospital.

282
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,381
What kind of joke is that?

283
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,583
Maybe... Maybe you got a second chance.

284
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,820
Daisy.

285
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,059
You got to go and find her for me.

286
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,624
I wanna talk to her.

287
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:27,228
Tell her she's the reason I'm alive.

288
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,842
We had a future.
You know, we had plans.

289
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:38,238
We picked out baby names together.

290
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:42,344
She betrayed that
without even asking my opinion.

291
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:47,647
Without even giving me time
to process it.

292
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,958
It's a difficult time for both of you.

293
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:57,060
- She's emotional.
- And hormone changes, mood swings.

294
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,332
They say she could lose her sex drive.

295
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:04,170
You'll get through this. All right?

296
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,135
You can do this.

297
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,104
You guys love each other.

298
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,181
Is that what you said
about you and Addy?

299
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,818
What?

300
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,687
- You left her.
- That was different.

301
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:23,194
Was it, Derek? Really?

302
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,229
You know, I got to check on a patient,
then get ready for dinner.

303
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,169
See you later.

304
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,896
Sure.

305
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,448
Where's the butter?

306
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,523
Oh, no, that's olive oil. I want butter.

307
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,287
Should I send the sommelier over?

308
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:03,596
That won't be necessary.
What is a nice, oaky Chardonnay?

309
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,261
I want Bordeaux.

310
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,396
The Chardonnay is better with lobster.

311
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,463
I'm having steak.

312
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,237
You... You eat red meat?

313
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,508
You don't?

314
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:26,348
You're seriously going to try
to find this girl?

315
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,416
Hunt her down
while she's working?

316
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:33,931
Look... OK, I know it's crazy, but
someone's got to tell her how he feels.

317
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:37,491
I mean, he's alive, right? Something
good has got to come out of this.

318
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,867
I mean, this could change everything.

319
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,770
See, I thought you were a romantic.

320
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:46,834
Was. Past tense.

321
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:52,409
Well, this is fun. Again.

322
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:57,979
I like the Hello Kitty, by the way.
Very pink. Very cheerful.

323
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,351
Daisy works in Billing. Which is where?

324
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,327
In the basement.

325
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,500
You need something, Chief? I have
one more surgery and then I'm free.

326
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,669
- No, no, no.
- OK.

327
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:24,280
- Have you made a decision yet?
- Sir?

328
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,817
The fellowship.
The Seattle Grace fellowship.

329
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:29,877
- I thought you'd have accepted.
- I haven't had a chance...

330
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,651
We're a private hospital
with extensive resources.

331
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:35,124
You'll get more
surgical experience here.

332
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,661
Write your own ticket.
Why aren't you excited?

333
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:42,996
No! I'm excited. I... Excuse me, sir,
I just need to scrub in. Thanks.

334
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,127
<i> Dr. Hines to the OR.</i>

335
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:55,702
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

336
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:03,344
You know, we should probably
skip dessert. I have an early morning.

337
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:06,721
Oh. Right. Not a problem.

338
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,461
Help! Is there a doctor in here?

339
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,572
Yes!

340
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:27,938
Call 911.

341
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,709
- He said he had heartburn.
- Is there a pulse?

342
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,647
Yes. It's rapid and unequal.

343
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:40,952
- Look. The length of his fingers.
- He's got to be at least six-foot-four.

344
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,586
- Marfan's.
- What does that have to do with it?

345
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,563
He's showing classic markers
for Marfan's syndrome.

346
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:49,794
- His blood vessel walls are weak.
- We need that ambulance.

347
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:53,201
- Fast. We need to get him to the OR.
- Before his aorta ruptures.

348
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:55,671
What are you talking about?
Who are you people?

349
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:59,575
We have a dissecting thoracic aorta.
We need a CT cleared and an OR ready.

350
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,612
Start another large-bore IV.

351
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,741
Continue high flow O2. Transport
sirens and lights to Seattle Grace.

352
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,307
- Who the hell are you?
- Hey!

353
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,355
He's the cardio-thoracic surgeon
who'll operate on him.

354
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,912
And she's with me.

355
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,830
Oh, I didn't...
Have you been discharged?

356
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:27,668
No. I'm going out to dinner
with my surgeon and our husbands.

357
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,698
Sort of a last supper, I guess.

358
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:34,109
I know, I know. Nothing after midnight.

359
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,773
You're disappointed, aren't you?

360
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:39,510
How do I look?

361
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,917
- You're a beautiful woman.
- And so are you.

362
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,449
Is that why this is
so hard to understand?

363
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:54,159
Ugh. Menopause. I know.

364
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:56,223
The boobs.

365
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:01,535
But they have hormone replacement,
reconstructions.

366
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,597
But the sexy Savvy,

367
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,542
the Savvy that gets noticed
when she walks into the room...

368
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:14,880
The Savvy that wakes her husband up
in the middle of the night to make love.

369
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:20,823
Yeah, I wonder if that Savvy
is still going to be there.

370
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,225
Honestly, I haven't a clue.

371
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:30,929
But then I think,
is that why Weiss married me?

372
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:36,363
God, I hope not.

373
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:53,088
Could this place be any further away?
It's like Siberia down here.

374
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,319
That's 'cause we don't like sick people.

375
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,088
Oh.

376
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,255
You know, you're in a hospital.

377
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:04,029
Uh, are you Daisy?

378
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,935
I don't deal with billing questions
after 7:00p. m.

379
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:11,101
- I'm just data entry at night.
- No, actually, Stu sent me.

380
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,974
- Is this some kind of joke?
- No. He's in this hospital.

381
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,539
He's had an accident.
I'm his doctor. He's fine.

382
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:24,021
We're taking him into surgery.
But he wanted me to find you.

383
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:31,526
You just tell that bastard that he could
have come looking for me ten years ago.

384
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,305
- OK, hold it here. Is this good?
- Yeah.

385
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,505
Lock it.

386
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:53,643
- What are you pissed about?
- You look at everything in a skirt.

387
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:58,348
I'd look at you in a skirt. Short.
Maybe something schoolgirl? Pleated.

388
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:02,923
If that skirt didn't have a pair of big
boobs attached, you'd stop looking.

389
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,155
When you cut 'em off,
you build 'em back up.

390
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,199
Maybe you get to upgrade.
Life goes on.

391
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,598
If there was a test
for testicular cancer,

392
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:13,467
you think men who
tested positive would have surgery?

393
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:15,938
No. You know why? It's castration.

394
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:18,999
What man would willingly
get rid of the part of his anatomy

395
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,136
that makes him a man?

396
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:24,010
This woman is having herself castrated.

397
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:28,348
And we book an OR and act like
it means nothing. It's not nothing.

398
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,550
God, how can you possibly act like it's
no big deal? I mean, what if it was me?

399
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:36,390
Izzie. You're making... Freaking out...
You know that, right?

400
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:38,326
If I was the one with the cancer gene,

401
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:40,626
if tomorrow my boobs
were made of plastic

402
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:45,534
and my skin had aged ten years
and my sex drive had dried up,

403
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:49,802
if it was me, Alex,
would you be so fine with it then?

404
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:54,504
Yeah, you'd be really hot to kiss me
with tongue then, wouldn't you?

405
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,656
Dr. Bailey's scrubbing in,
so we're going to get started.

406
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:10,024
OK. Hey, George, listen,
did you find her?

407
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:17,891
I'm very sorry, Stu.
They said she was on vacation.

408
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,698
Oh, yeah?

409
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,304
Maybe her parents.

410
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:26,936
I bet you she went up to New Hampshire.
That's where she's from.

411
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,640
- I'm going to push the joy juice.
- Up, up and away.

412
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:33,047
Maybe you can see her after
your surgery. When you recover.

413
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:35,177
It's all good, man.

414
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,380
Thanks for trying.

415
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:40,618
It really meant a lot to...

416
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:46,230
- Hold on, we have a problem.
- He's crashing? Dr. Bailey?

417
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,959
O'Malley, start CPR.

418
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,562
Push epi.

419
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,009
- You'll need to notify the family.
- What happened?

420
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:09,247
There'll be an autopsy. Sometimes people
get on the table and they just die.

421
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,414
There's no way of knowing beforehand,
or of controlling it.

422
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,789
But he fell five stories and lived.
It doesn't make any sense.

423
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,055
He survived,
so I could go and find Daisy

424
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:21,257
and then she didn't even want
to see him. So what's the point?

425
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:24,859
We're all part of the cosmic joke,
O'Malley. Now leave me alone.

426
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:29,337
- Oh, Dr. Bailey...
- What?

427
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:33,173
Mr. Sorrento doesn't want me
to tell his wife that she's dying.

428
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,144
- You haven't told her yet?
- No.

429
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:38,580
OK, I didn't hear you say that.
You're her doctor.

430
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,245
It's your responsibility to give
patients the information necessary

431
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,188
to make an informed decision. Now,
I'm hungry. I'm tired. You're in my way.

432
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:51,853
- Can you see the echo?
- A dissection isn't subtle.

433
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,660
Did you see that wing span?
And the pectus carinatum?

434
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:58,191
- What about his palate?
- The definition of high arched.

435
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,838
- You're being wooed, aren't you?
- Excuse me?

436
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,976
The fellowship. LA Med,
Chicago Central, they're wooing you.

437
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:18,784
You're fielding offers, looking at
bonuses, letting yourself be wooed.

438
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,553
- No, Chief...
- No, it's fine, it's fine.

439
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:25,562
Go be a hotshot somewhere else.
But tell me...

440
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:31,333
how could you do this to me?

441
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:34,701
You know, I'm hurt.

442
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,638
Really hurt.

443
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,539
After all I've done for you.

444
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,671
You're gifted, and you're ungrateful.
And that's all I'm saying.

445
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,313
I'm pregnant, you blind moron.

446
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,314
You're what?

447
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:55,690
My heart rate is 110.
I'm burning 3,000 calories a day.

448
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,423
My legs are swollen.
I've got indigestion and gas.

449
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:03,991
Did you know that carrying a boy in your
uterus means you burn 10%% more calories

450
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:07,003
than if you had a girl?
Guess what I'm carrying.

451
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:11,531
I try for seven damn years, and a month
before my fellowship notifications,

452
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,907
the stick turns blue. Men.

453
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:18,844
From the very beginning they just
suck the life right out of you.

454
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,181
I'm not leaving. I'm pregnant.

455
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,951
Um...

456
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,957
Congratulations.

457
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:34,191
Dr. Yang, you're handling the saw.

458
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,068
Thank you, Dr. Burke.

459
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,374
You won't let me pick the wine,
but this you'll let me do?

460
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,813
- Are we all set for bypass?
- Almost there.

461
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,991
</i>

462
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:17,198
So, apparently we both live
in this elevator.

463
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:22,908
Meredith.

464
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:27,280
You could at least acknowledge I exist.

465
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,460
Hello, Dr. Grey.

466
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:39,519
Hello.

467
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:43,499
- You ready to go?
- I was on my way.

468
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:58,771
Well, it took three hours,
but the surgery went perfectly.

469
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,183
All we have to do now is wait and see
how he's doing when he wakes up.

470
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,245
- Why did this happen?
- Almost every patient with Marfan's

471
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:08,315
has an aorta that fails.
It's just a matter of when.

472
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:12,454
I guess it's lucky you two were
having dinner at the next table.

473
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:15,789
It was.

474
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,926
Take care.

475
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:24,566
And we can treat it with surgery
and chemo, but...

476
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:35,114
We're supposed to go to Venice
at the end of the month.

477
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:37,416
- Do you know the story?
- No.

478
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:41,083
They say if you ride a gondola
under the Bridge of Sighs,

479
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,389
you're together for eternity.

480
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:48,059
- You didn't tell Jed, did you?
- Excuse me?

481
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:51,863
He's always been so worried
that I'd go first.

482
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:54,496
You don't want him to know?

483
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:59,168
You're young. I don't expect you
to understand an old broad like me.

484
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:03,339
You can't have a relationship
built on a lie. Can you?

485
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,405
Honey, it's not a lie.

486
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,575
It's our future.

487
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:16,324
I've been with the love of my life
for 60 years, and now I'm dying.

488
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:22,725
We're going to Venice.

489
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,633
We're getting in that gondola.

490
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:41,141
When Addy told me she was
coming here, I had such a good feeling.

491
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:45,354
You guys are going to make it.
You were always meant to be.

492
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:50,292
A couple of clams on the half shell.
Couple of peas in the pod.

493
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,091
- We're working on the pod part.
- It's about choices.

494
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:56,224
Well, here's to taking life
in your own hands.

495
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,767
Cheers. Cheers.

496
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:00,998
Yeah. And here's to bull.
And here's to crap.

497
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,934
And here's to oophorectomy,

498
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,740
hysterectomy,
double bilateral mastectomy.

499
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,144
Please. Stop.

500
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,648
- How smart am I to know those words?
- Stop.

501
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:17,416
Here's to breast reconstruction,
nipple reconstruction.

502
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:21,057
Here's to losing your wife.

503
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:24,925
Here's to being the ass
who can't be supportive.

504
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,464
Here's to that.

505
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,641
Weiss?

506
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:48,878
Don't talk to me. Keep walking.

507
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:52,616
You should get some sleep, sober up
so you're ready for Savvy's surgery.

508
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,385
Come on, I'll drive you.

509
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:56,450
Oh.

510
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:59,291
I'm supposed to hold her hand
while they rip her apart?

511
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:01,388
That's the definition of love?

512
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,663
- You can do this.
- Maybe I can't.

513
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:11,074
- Maybe I just like to screw my wife.
- Weiss.

514
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,542
And that's what she'll think
if I'm not there.

515
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,340
You're going to be there.

516
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:19,973
This from a guy who packed his bags
in the middle of the night

517
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:22,645
and drove 3,000 miles
to live in a trailer.

518
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,188
Yeah, well, what am I doing
with Addison now?

519
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:29,420
Hm? I'm trying to work it out.

520
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:33,826
I don't know, am I out of my mind?
I don't know, you tell me.

521
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:43,663
It's about the ring.

522
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:46,833
It's about the vows.

523
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:52,240
Savvy didn't screw around with you
with your best friend.

524
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,307
She's looking for support.

525
00:35:55,486 --> 00:36:00,219
If you don't give that to her now,
if you don't give her that support,

526
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:04,592
then what the hell am I doing?

527
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:17,531
You didn't tell her, did you?

528
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:22,112
No. I didn't tell her.

529
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:53,508
- I thought he cheated fate.
- Maybe he did cheat fate.

530
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:55,068
He died.

531
00:36:55,146 --> 00:37:00,243
I think you can't wait for someone to
fly underneath you and save your life.

532
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:02,548
I think you have to save yourself.

533
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,687
You mean the pigeons
aren't going to come?

534
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:12,524
The pigeons aren't going to come.

535
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:16,494
Hold still.

536
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,668
Come on, make sure you get both sides.

537
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:24,071
You know these are going to be
next year's holiday cards.

538
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:27,201
I want them to be immortalized
before they're gone.

539
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:30,406
And this way, Weiss gets
to look at them whenever he wants.

540
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:35,208
These are going to be great.

541
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:37,811
- We're scheduled to go in at eight?
- Yeah.

542
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:42,951
I'm taking you down to the pre-op
in just a few minutes.

543
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,930
Weiss will show up, Addy,
he always does.

544
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:53,694
Sav, as your doctor
you know I'm 100%% on your side.

545
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:58,140
But as your friend,
are you absolutely sure about this?

546
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,776
I know what I'm losing.

547
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,644
I get it.

548
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:07,513
But think about what I'm gaining.

549
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,382
My life.

550
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,478
This gives me a shot.

551
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:15,252
A shot at the future.
A shot at me and Weiss

552
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:22,095
becoming this crazy old wrinkled couple
that argues all the time.

553
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:27,229
I mean, wouldn't you want that?

554
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:31,203
A chance to grow old with Derek?

555
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,134
Yeah.

556
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:37,003
Yeah, I do.

557
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,582
- Oh, God.
- Oh, Sav.

558
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:48,056
<i> Maybe Romeo and Juliet</i>
<i>were fated to be together,</i>

559
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,616
<i>but just for a while.</i>

560
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,822
<i>And then their time passed.</i>

561
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:56,762
<i>If they could have</i>
<i>known that beforehand,</i>

562
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,394
<i>maybe it all would have been OK.</i>

563
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,836
Here's the thing. I like your rack.

564
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:07,105
What is wrong with you? Why do you have
to be so... What is wrong with you?

565
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:11,114
I like your rack. I'd want them around
if I could have them. Trust me, I would.

566
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,481
But it wouldn't be the end of the world
if you got rid of them.

567
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:17,919
Because really, I'd want you.

568
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:25,459
Ow! What was that for?

569
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,895
<i>I told Mrs. Snyder</i>
<i>that when I was grown up,</i>

570
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,399
<i>I'd take my fate into my own hands.</i>

571
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:38,239
<i>I wouldn't let some guy drag me down.</i>

572
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:59,961
<i>Mrs. Snyder said I'd be lucky if I ever</i>
<i>had that kind of passion with someone.</i>

573
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,989
<i>And that if I did,</i>
<i>we'd be together forever.</i>

574
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,695
We never really got our date.

575
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:09,831
Are you kidding? That was the best date
I've ever been on.

576
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:24,481
<i>Even now, I believe that for</i>
<i>the most part, love is about choices.</i>

577
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,394
He's not coming, is he?

578
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,771
You're shaking.

579
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:52,906
You're here.

580
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,951
<i>It's about putting down</i>
<i>the poison and dagger</i>

581
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:02,118
<i>and making your own happy ending,</i>
<i>most of the time.</i>

582
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:09,093
I'm going to get started now.
Are you ready?

583
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,898
Yeah.

584
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,200
Ready.

585
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:27,239
<i>And that sometimes,</i>
<i>despite all your best choices</i>

586
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:32,847
<i>and all your best intensions,</i>
<i>fate wins anyway.</i>

587
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,360
I miss you.

588
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,950
I can't.
