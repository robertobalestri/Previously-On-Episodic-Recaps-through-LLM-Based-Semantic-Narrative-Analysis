00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:03,797
<i> Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:04,996
Divorce papers.

3
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:08,370
The ball's in your court. If you sign,
I'll be on the first plane out.

4
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:10,375
Would you like
to go out with me tonight?

5
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:13,173
The hospital grants you
four months to retake the exam.

6
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:14,770
If I don't pass a second time?

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,544
You will no longer
be a surgical resident.

8
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,517
- You look great.
- Thanks.

9
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,144
- Are you OK?
- You ready to go?

10
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:22,779
- I didn't lie.
- You withheld the truth.

11
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,825
- Had I known you were pregnant...
- You broke off with me.

12
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,359
- Dr. Yang!
- Cristina!

13
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:30,089
It's an extrauterine
pregnancy. She's bleeding out.

14
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:33,030
- I'm not supposed to be here.
- No, you're not.

15
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,567
I don't want someone
who doesn't want me,

16
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:40,334
but if there's the slightest chance
that he does, I'm not leaving Seattle.

17
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,705
<i> Pain comes in all forms.</i>

18
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,510
I had a good time. Really. Thank you.

19
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:52,415
It was the perfect evening.
Best date ever.

20
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:53,509
- Whatever.
- Izzie.

21
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:57,750
I especially liked the part where you
treated me like crap the entire night.

22
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,520
- That was fun.
- I had a good time.

23
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,220
- Really?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:06,561
<i>The small twinge, a bit of soreness,</i>
<i>the random pain.</i>

25
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,363
<i>The normal pains we live with every day.</i>

26
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,427
I gotta go.

27
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:17,709
Seriously?

28
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,507
<i>Then there's the kind of pain</i>
<i>we can't ignore.</i>

29
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,945
Seriously?

30
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:25,849
<i>A level of pain so great</i>
<i>that it blocks out everything else.</i>

31
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,513
- I'm sleeping.
- Oh, shut it.

32
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,021
Shut...

33
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,490
<i>Makes the rest of the world fade away.</i>

34
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,426
- I don't want to talk.
- Meredith...

35
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:38,658
You didn't sign the divorce papers.
Fine. End of discussion.

36
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,029
- Meredith...
- What?

37
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,798
<i>Until all we can think about</i>
<i>is how much we hurt.</i>

38
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,396
I usually just say "Meredith"
then you yell at me.

39
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,271
I haven't thought past that point.

40
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:51,469
I actually didn't have anything planned.

41
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:55,844
- <i>How we manage our pain is up to us.</i>
- What is that? Hey. Stop it.

42
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,281
Seriously? Seriously!

43
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:00,251
Seriously!

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,153
This is a very small bed.

45
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,919
He's a brain surgeon.

46
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,825
I look fantastic. I shaved my legs.

47
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,762
He's a brain surgeon.
How can he be so brainless?

48
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:15,232
- Hello? Seriously!
- Seriously!

49
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,134
Shh. Sleep.

50
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,267
<i>Pain.</i>

51
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,968
<i>We anesthetize...</i>

52
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:26,910
<i>ride it out, embrace it, ignore it...</i>

53
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:38,955
<i>And for some of us, the best way to</i>
<i>manage pain is to just push through it.</i>

54
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,122
- You're dripping.
- I'm back.

55
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,634
I just want to make that clear.
I'm ready to work.

56
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:52,694
- Has anyone seen Dr. Shepherd?
- His name's on the OR board.

57
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:55,866
- He should be here somewhere.
- I'm good. Ready to scrub in.

58
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,638
- I'm 100%% on top of my game.
- You just got discharged.

59
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:01,009
- Pace yourself.
- I'm paced. I'm paced.

60
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,138
Rounds, people.

61
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,312
What? You're not talking to me anymore?

62
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,914
OK, what happened last night?
What is going on with you?

63
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,617
I'm fine.

64
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,286
What's your problem?

65
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:19,798
Fine. You know what, Alex?
No, I'm not talking to you anymore.

66
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,163
Dr. Bailey.

67
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:28,071
Henry Lamott, age 42, is scheduled
with Dr. Shepherd for a spinal implant

68
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,405
to control the pain
of his herniated disk.

69
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,343
Is allergic to all pain medication...

70
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,142
- Is that...?
- Porn.

71
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,739
Porn?

72
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,681
- As in porn?
- All right.

73
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:42,551
- What are we watching?
- Karev. Go stand in the hall.

74
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:47,150
Mr. and Mrs. Lamott,
I'm sure you are really nice people,

75
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,593
and what you do
in the privacy of your own...

76
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:52,392
Look, we can't have porn in here.
This is a hospital.

77
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:56,265
It's for my pain. My doc said
it releases endorphins in the brain

78
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,827
and helps keep my pain
at a manageable level.

79
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,396
- Really?
- George. Hall.

80
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:11,345
- What is this?
- <i>Nasty, Naughty Nurses... 4.</i>

81
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:19,925
- That does not look comfortable.
- Trust me. It's not.

82
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,086
Get in the hall.

83
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,089
O'Malley, Karev,
you're in the Pit.

84
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,755
Stevens, there's a cardiac patient
for you on two.

85
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,789
Yang, keep an eye on the Lamotts.
I don't want any problems. Go.

86
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,564
Grey, your mother's
being discharged this evening.

87
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:08,004
- You've made arrangements?
- The nursing home is coming at eight.

88
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:11,100
Then you're with Shepherd,
Derek Shepherd, today.

89
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,270
Hey, life is short. Times are hard.

90
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,439
The road is long
with many a winding turn.

91
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,881
He asked for you. Take it up with him.

92
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,054
OK.

93
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:26,853
Pete Willoughby, 25-year-old,
GSW to the chest.

94
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:30,760
- Return of 860 cc's of blood...
- Oh, damn, this hurts.

95
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,321
He's put out more than 200 cc's
over the past hour.

96
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,663
Movies never say
how much it hurts to get shot.

97
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,499
Push morphine, two milligrams.
Alex, this is my case.

98
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,163
Morphine, five milligrams.

99
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,298
- You didn't call him.
- I was here first.

100
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:46,243
You got her first because I let you.
Where's the chest films?

101
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,679
I got it. You always get the surgery.
Today, I'm getting a surgery.

102
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,616
Guys. Knock it off.
He's one of Seattle's finest.

103
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,745
You've got an entire police force
watching you.

104
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,156
Page Dr. Burke.

105
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:04,856
- Let him know I'm bringing up a GSW.
- "We" are bringing up a GSW.

106
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,902
Looks like you'll be able
to go home today, Ellis.

107
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:14,030
- But I still have patients to see.
- No. No more patients.

108
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,837
I'll be back to check on you later, OK?

109
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:20,174
You should know
I'm thinking of leaving Thatcher.

110
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,077
I should never have married him.

111
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,809
I'll leave him. You leave Adele.

112
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,785
Then when our residency's over we can
both get jobs at the same hospital.

113
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:31,654
Why don't you get her meds ready
for discharge, nurse? Thank you.

114
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,557
Ellis, that was a long time ago,
remember?

115
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,932
We had this discussion 21 years ago.

116
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,733
Think about it.
We should make the break now.

117
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:50,833
If we wait till residency's over, you'll
be at one hospital, I'll be in another.

118
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,142
We could end up at opposite ends
of the country. It'll be too late.

119
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,648
- Meredith.
- Your wife is looking for you.

120
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,122
Oh, my God,
this is hard for me, Meredith.

121
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,716
Let me make it easy.
I'm not going to be that woman.

122
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,524
The one who breaks up a marriage
or begs you to want me.

123
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,759
You can sign the papers or you can not.
The choice is yours.

124
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,631
Either way, when it comes
to this relationship, I'm out.

125
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:20,263
Now, where's this patient
I'm supposed to be helping you with?

126
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,330
Down there.

127
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,576
You shouldn't have walked
the dog in the rain.

128
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,637
Oh, Lou, it wasn't the rain.
I just passed out.

129
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,875
- Actually, Mrs. Bradley...
- Verna.

130
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,680
Verna.
You presented with lateral ST elevations

131
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,620
and reciprocal inferior changes
consistent with an MI.

132
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,816
- A heart attack.
- Oh, my God.

133
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,381
Lou, don't worry.

134
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,827
I've had little chest pains before
and it turned out to be nothing.

135
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,330
This is nothing.

136
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,798
Lou, not in front of the doctor.

137
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,303
I've had a twinge in my back
for a while.

138
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:56,501
I thought it would go away,
but then last night, my legs went numb.

139
00:07:56,576 --> 00:08:00,876
This morning, my back...
The pain is just too much.

140
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:05,475
Miss Chue, we'll put you on a PCA pump,
give you morphine to control the pain.

141
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:08,042
- Thank you.
- OK. But there's a greater problem.

142
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,748
- I've just looked at your MRI...
- Anna!

143
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:17,429
- Why didn't you call us before coming?
- I'm sorry. These are my parents.

144
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,987
- Hi.
- What's going on?

145
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:23,161
Anna's MRI has shown that
she has a myxopapillary ependymoma.

146
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,727
It's a tumor in her spinal canal.

147
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,932
But the good news
is that we can operate.

148
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,202
You have a 95%% chance
of fully recovering

149
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,506
if we get you to surgery
as soon as possible.

150
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,046
We can't wait.
With a tumor this aggressive

151
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:39,744
even waiting another day puts you
at risk for permanent paralysis.

152
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,116
Father?

153
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,816
No. No surgery.

154
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:50,352
Mr. Chue, without surgery, Anna will
be paralyzed within the next 24 hours.

155
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,954
No surgery today.
We're taking her home.

156
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,592
- Anna needs surgery.
- She can have it another time.

157
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:59,399
- Mr. Chue...
- We are taking our daughter home.

158
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:05,710
Anna, you're over 18.
You don't need your father's consent.

159
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,877
I'm Hmong, and my father is the elder.

160
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,080
If he says I go home, I go home.

161
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,417
Hmong? Let's find out what that means.

162
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:25,055
Contact Social Services, see if we
can get somebody to talk to them.

163
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:28,430
- Do I process her discharge?
- Yeah. It's insane, but we have to.

164
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,334
It reminds me of a case I had
in New York where a woman...

165
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,498
Look, do you need me
for anything else work-related?

166
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:41,242
Look. I was married for 11 years.
Addison is my family.

167
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:44,408
That is 11 Thanksgivings,
11 birthdays, and 11 Christmases.

168
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:47,782
In one day, I'm supposed to sign
a piece of paper and end my family?

169
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:50,447
A person doesn't do that.
Not without hesitation.

170
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:54,653
I'm entitled to a little uncertainty.
A moment to understand the magnitude

171
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,195
of what it means
to cut somebody out of my life.

172
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,891
I'm entitled to at least one moment...

173
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,264
...of painful doubt.

174
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,463
And a little understanding from you
would be nice.

175
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,800
- Dr. Shepherd. Still here, I see.
- I couldn't leave you.

176
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:16,371
- Have you seen the other Dr. Shepherd?
- I'll tell him you're looking for him.

177
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:21,284
- So, thanks for, you know, being there.
- No thanks needed.

178
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,822
- OK.
- So where are we?

179
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,551
The north-east corner of a hospital.

180
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,254
- Oh, I'm getting back on my feet.
- Fine.

181
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,660
- That doesn't mean that...
- Cristina...

182
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:35,599
- It's my first day back, I've got...
- I'm not waiting forever.

183
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,839
Karev and O'Malley are bringing
a GSW. Want to scrub in?

184
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:44,205
No can do. I'm trying to get out of here
at a decent hour tonight.

185
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,801
- What, you got a date?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

186
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,339
A handsome man is whisking me away
to a love nest for the weekend.

187
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,750
You got shot in the line of duty?

188
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,722
First month on the job.
Can you believe my luck?

189
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,884
Guy pulls a gun and I freeze up.

190
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,292
The rookie who let himself get shot.

191
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,990
- I'm never gonna live this down.
- Sure, you will.

192
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,999
You think?

193
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,194
Absolutely.

194
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,297
Hey, I got Verna Bradley's tests back.

195
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,534
I don't think she had a heart attack.

196
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:19,271
Look at the changes in her EKG.
She had something.

197
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,576
Her serial enzymes and
dobutamine stress echo were negative.

198
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:27,312
- I actually think she's fine.
- Get a cardiac cath. Be thorough.

199
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,013
I am thorough.

200
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:33,616
- What's the deal with Izzie?
- She shaved her legs for you.

201
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,184
- And?
- You didn't even kiss her good night.

202
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:40,358
- You didn't follow through?
- Hey, I always follow through.

203
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,958
- You didn't last night.
- Mind your own business.

204
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,502
Mind...

205
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:50,134
She had expectations. Women have
expectations. And you didn't meet them.

206
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,801
I live with these women.

207
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,005
When you guys don't meet
their expectations, I hear about it.

208
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,174
I didn't get any sleep last night.

209
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,513
So, you know, it is my business.

210
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:13,532
- Dude, we're not moving.
- Really! You think?

211
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:26,705
<i>Dr. Cole, 2621. Dr. Cole, 2621.</i>

212
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,849
You know how long
the surgical scar takes to heal.

213
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,585
You must be in pain.
You should take something.

214
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,355
- Drugs are for babies.
- I hate Alex.

215
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:48,594
- And the non sequitur award goes to...
- I'm sorry. I hate Alex.

216
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:54,302
- I broke up with Derek.
- Burke wants to have a relationship.

217
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,568
Boys are stupid.

218
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,545
Yep.

219
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,448
"If elevator should stop,
do not become alarmed."

220
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,248
"Press the button marked 'alarm'
for assistance."

221
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,185
If they don't want us to be alarmed,

222
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:14,283
- why call the button "alarm"?
- That didn't work the last five times.

223
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,624
We've lost power. We're stuck.

224
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,390
You OK?

225
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,557
His pressure is falling.

226
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,727
Alex, there's a lot more of his blood
in the Pleurovac.

227
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,931
- We need to get him to the OR.
- OK. Don't whisper.

228
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,975
I don't want to complain,
but I got a bullet in my chest

229
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:33,375
and whispering isn't a sign
that I'm going to be A-OK, you know?

230
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:37,040
- Damn it. It's out.
- It's bad. It's bad, right?

231
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:40,085
Someone is going to get us out of here.
Don't worry.

232
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,356
- How we doing?
- Can you move me to another room?

233
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,621
- The lights and TV went out.
- Power outage in the east wing.

234
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,184
They'll have it back on soon.

235
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:53,993
- You're not critical. You'll be fine.
- Oh, God! What am I gonna do?

236
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,500
- You mean...
- Without my porn.

237
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,430
Read a book. Talk to your wife.

238
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,632
School closed early
because of the storm.

239
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,972
She had to pick up the kids.
She won't be back until after dinner.

240
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:10,209
Well, I'm sure you can find
some normal way of amusing yourself.

241
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,342
- I need my porn!
- Yeah.

242
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,353
Lightning hit a substation.

243
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:19,289
We're running on backup generators.
One of them is down. Richard, breathe.

244
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:23,795
The only means of transporting patients
from the ER to the OR isn't working.

245
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,697
Don't tell me to breathe.
I'll breathe if I want to breathe.

246
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,399
- Caught between floors.
- How bad is it?

247
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:36,703
- Two interns and a GSW to the chest.
- Good air in, bad air out.

248
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,468
Come on, people, get those doors open.

249
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,306
- It's jammed. It won't open.
- Move.

250
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:49,548
- This is as wide as it goes.
- What... What did you two do?

251
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,715
Nothing.

252
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,559
- How's the patient?
- He's not looking so good.

253
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:07,737
- Why do the lights keep flickering?
- Something about a backup generator.

254
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:12,539
This pump will provide you with a
morphine drip and should stop your pain.

255
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:16,911
I told you, I don't need it.
I'm going home.

256
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:21,385
You'll have to sign a form stating that
you're leaving against medical advice.

257
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:22,681
Fine.

258
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,189
I know this is new and confusing.

259
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:32,256
I called a social worker
and she's willing to talk to you...

260
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,232
Spare me the white-girl,
cultural-divide love.

261
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,168
I grew up down the street.
I play in a band. I went to U-Dub.

262
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,831
I get it. But my father doesn't.

263
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,741
He says no, it's no.

264
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,905
We're talking about
your ability to ever walk again.

265
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,416
That's what you're talking about.
I'm talking about my family.

266
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,576
Have you even heard of
the Hmong people?

267
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:56,246
Our religion has got rules
that are way old

268
00:15:56,322 --> 00:16:00,588
and way set in stone and way spiritual
and you don't mess with them.

269
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,786
You don't anger the ancestors.

270
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:07,821
Even if you pierce your tongue
and play in a band.

271
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,095
What are the rules, exactly?

272
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,502
ICU patients are going
to the south wing.

273
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:17,064
Telemetry and stepdown patients,
north wing.

274
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,770
- You paged me.
- Porn as pain management?

275
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:23,008
You met Henry. There are lots
of theories on how to treat pain.

276
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,516
Porn as pain management?

277
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,348
It's possible pornography
can stimulate the brain

278
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,650
to produce endorphins
that minimize pain.

279
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:34,489
- Porn as pain management.
- I didn't prescribe it. It wasn't me.

280
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,494
Take it up with the physician.

281
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:40,464
If he turns out to be some sex weirdo,
it's on you. That's all I'm saying.

282
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,763
- Oh, and your wife is looking for you.
- I know.

283
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,235
- Derek.
- Yes?

284
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:49,400
Talk to Anna's father. I'd do it myself
but having testicles is a requirement.

285
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:53,377
- What happened to Social Services?
- According to Anna, they can't help us.

286
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:57,108
Anna's father believes she's missing
something she needs for surgery.

287
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,948
- Missing something? Missing what?
- One of her souls.

288
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,353
We don't need a social worker.
We need a shaman.

289
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,015
Shaman?

290
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,855
Cardio tells me
your cath went just fine.

291
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:12,363
- Is that much bruising normal?
- Your wound looks good.

292
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,992
So do the results on your cath.
You have no blockages in your arteries.

293
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:19,196
- Which means?
- You did not have a heart attack.

294
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,206
- So I can go home?
- Not yet.

295
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,903
Your EKG shows significant changes.

296
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:30,074
And I'm going to find out why
before you leave the hospital.

297
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,981
- Hey, Pete, what are you doing?
- I have to get home.

298
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:40,424
- Pete, you're in the hospital.
- Need to get home. Need to get home.

299
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:44,019
- What's his blood pressure?
- It's not reading. He's too agitated.

300
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,530
- How's his pulse?
- Thready, but still there.

301
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:49,294
- Do you have instruments?
- A code box and gloves.

302
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,199
You didn't bring an open chest tray?

303
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,135
- We thought...
- No time for excuses.

304
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,332
- Blood pressure.
- I've taken it three times.

305
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,865
- And?
- I can't hear a systolic over 50.

306
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,238
He's gonna die.

307
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,051
- Intubate him. I'll be back.
- Where are you going?

308
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:15,082
To get an instrument tray. You guys are
going to have to open up his chest.

309
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:21,497
- Are you sure about that?
- No.

310
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,177
When's Burke coming back?

311
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,484
When is Dr. Burke coming back?

312
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,521
- Alex...
- Oh, would you shut up?

313
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:03,264
Mr. Chue. You want to take Anna home
for a healing ritual?

314
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:07,403
When sickness comes, it means
that one of our souls is missing.

315
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,346
Anna needs to have her souls intact
before surgery.

316
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:13,646
- She needs a shaman.
- Well, you could have told me that.

317
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,119
Why? So you could call me a fool?

318
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,919
I respect that you have traditions
that I can't understand.

319
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,460
But you're standing beside me
in a $3,000 suit

320
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,826
so I know you respect
that I'm telling you

321
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:29,197
Anna needs surgery in the next 24 hours
if she's going to continue to walk.

322
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,860
She can't leave this hospital.

323
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:34,099
She can't undergo surgery
without her soul. She'd die.

324
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,111
All right then.

325
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,240
We're just gonna have to get a shaman.
Today. In the hospital.

326
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,341
Shamans aren't in the Yellow Pages.

327
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:49,945
Our shaman is 500 miles from here.
You are an arrogant man.

328
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,788
No. I'm just a guy
with access to a helicopter.

329
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,623
Thank you.

330
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:04,696
- Finding her soul won't be easy.
- It never is.

331
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,803
This is unconscionable. Not
enough power to move those elevators?

332
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,071
They're replacing the backup.
Fire department is standing by.

333
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,305
- Critical patients?
- Moved to south wing.

334
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,643
- Incoming trauma?
- Rerouted to Mercy West.

335
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,548
- That backup should have been replaced.
- Yes, sir.

336
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:24,385
- Why didn't it happen?
- Chief, you'd have to ask maintenance.

337
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:28,825
- I wouldn't know.
- Dr. Bailey, you know everything.

338
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,885
Tell me whose butt to kick.

339
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,392
That would be your butt, Chief.

340
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,161
You didn't authorize
the replacement generator,

341
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,635
saving money for the new MRI machine.

342
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:39,966
Um...

343
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:44,202
I need to get on
back down to the... OR.

344
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:58,317
Hey, this isn't gonna be too sterile,
but we can still try.

345
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,415
Prep and drape the patient.

346
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:36,251
Can you get me copies of all
Verna Bradley's records and page me?

347
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,660
- I'll be on the OR floor.
- <i> Dr. Bennett...</i>

348
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,426
Hey! Wait...
Where are you two going so fast?

349
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,163
Burke is talking George and Alex
through heart surgery in the elevator.

350
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:48,138
Shepherd's setting up
a shaman healing ritual.

351
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:49,969
Rock on.

352
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,942
I have porn guy.

353
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,871
Help! Please!

354
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,875
Mr. Lamott? What's wrong?

355
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,286
Your pressure's elevated.

356
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:05,517
Pulse is racing. You're really in pain.

357
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,182
What? Do you think?

358
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:10,592
Are you telling me the porn
actually sedated you?

359
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,756
You think I'm a pervert,
watching that stuff in front of you?

360
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,528
Well... yes.

361
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,193
OK, OK.

362
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:24,837
You're allergic
to most narcotics and NSAIDs.

363
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:29,040
I suppose we can try
droperidol and diphenhydramine.

364
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,878
That put me into a coma last year.

365
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,181
Well, I can get an anesthesiologist
down here.

366
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:38,984
But with your surgery tomorrow,
he won't give you an epidural block.

367
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,924
- What am I gonna do?
- Uh... hold on.

368
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,903
We're really gonna do this.

369
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,775
Take these.

370
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,543
Karev, take the scalpel.

371
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,091
Alex! Come on.

372
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:20,858
Alex!

373
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,109
Ventilate!

374
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,012
I got it.

375
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,619
What do I do?

376
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:52,151
Make a large, anterior, lateral,
midaxillary incision

377
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,892
in the fifth intercostal space.

378
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,464
- How... How large?
- As long as possible.

379
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,805
You need to get two hands in there.
It needs to be long and deep.

380
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:07,538
- Use the scissors if you have to.
- OK.

381
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:14,073
- Don't cut into the lung or heart.
- How can I be sure of that?

382
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,120
You just have to be sure.

383
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,527
We're not in Kansas any more.

384
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:51,451
Your shaman's late.

385
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,457
My shaman is never late.

386
00:24:57,762 --> 00:25:02,199
Can you see anything? Poor George,
he doesn't have the steadiest hands.

387
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,325
- Izzie.
- Yeah?

388
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,835
He can hear you.

389
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,270
O'Malley? How you doing down there?

390
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,673
The fire department's here.

391
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,940
- They can get the doors open...
- No.

392
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,675
Nobody works on the elevator.

393
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:21,947
I have an open chest and a very
nervous intern in there. Keep them back.

394
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,818
- OK, guys, we're not going...
- O'Malley?

395
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:29,525
Dr. Burke,
I didn't cut the heart or the lungs.

396
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,789
Good, good, O'Malley. Really good.

397
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:35,162
Now, check for injuries
and do a pericardiotomy.

398
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:40,102
I'll need some lap pads, forceps,
Metzenbaums and Satinsky clamps?

399
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:45,168
Yes, you will.

400
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:47,803
You tell anyone I did this for you,

401
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:52,145
not only will I kill you,
I will sell your body parts for cash.

402
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,577
OK. So...

403
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:59,789
There were these women. Nurses.

404
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:05,160
Three nurses. And they were... naughty.

405
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:10,167
They were really, really naughty. They
were three naughty nurses. Saucy, even.

406
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:15,764
They were saucy and bad and naughty.
Three saucy, bad, naughty nurses.

407
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,240
They were taking a shower. Together.

408
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:22,474
Soaping each other up.
And then this doctor walks in

409
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:26,244
and he sees
these three naughty, bad nurses

410
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,718
with these great big...

411
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:32,587
Mrs. Bradley, do you realize that
you've been admitted to the hospital

412
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,921
on this date for the past seven years?

413
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,255
That can't be.

414
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:39,764
- I don't remember the date exactly...
- I have the medical records.

415
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:44,234
On this date for the past seven years
you have what looks like a heart attack.

416
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:48,568
No. No, I know I've had some scares
but I don't...

417
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,336
Every year on this date?

418
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:53,934
Is there significance
to this date for you?

419
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,809
No. Nothing.

420
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,441
What were you doing the first time
you had a cardiac episode?

421
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:02,145
Who can remember back that far?

422
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:07,021
We were in the yard. I remember because
our neighbor... What was his name?

423
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:09,424
- Ted.
- That's right. He died.

424
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,462
Of an aneurysm, I think.

425
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:14,692
And we watched as the
funeral home people took him away

426
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,791
and you had your first attack.

427
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:21,669
- And you were close to Ted?
- No. We barely knew Ted.

428
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,507
That was all very sad, but what does
that have to do with Verna's heart?

429
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:34,250
I removed a small clot
from the pericardium.

430
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,083
- No obvious cardiac injuries.
- Change in the vitals?

431
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:41,387
- BP's still too low to register.
- We need to cross-clamp the aorta.

432
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:49,099
Stick your hand in
and bluntly dissect down

433
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,533
until you feel two tube-like structures.

434
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:54,731
The esophagus will be
more medial and anterior.

435
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:58,535
I feel one tube
that's easily collapsible

436
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:02,808
and the other's more muscular, spongy.

437
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,543
I feel...
I can feel the spine just underneath it.

438
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:10,179
- Yes! You're touching the aorta.
- I'm touching the aorta.

439
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,849
Wrap the index finger
of your left hand around it

440
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:16,087
and apply the Satinsky clamp
with your right hand.

441
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:27,201
Got it. Wait, I...
I think I can localize the bleeding.

442
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,536
It's coming from the inferior vena cava.

443
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:34,408
- Can you find the lesion?
- Yeah. Yeah, I think I can feel it.

444
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:38,510
- It's too far in to repair.
- How big is it?

445
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,211
Small, maybe... smaller than a dime.

446
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:45,780
OK, O'Malley. I want you
to take your finger and plug the hole.

447
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:54,257
I can feel his heart starting to fill
more. It's beating a little stronger.

448
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:58,359
- Excellent. Keep your finger there.
- OK. Now what?

449
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,168
- That's it.
- That's it?

450
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:09,569
I just stand here
with my finger plugging the hole?

451
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:13,174
Until we can get you
out of that elevator and into the OR.

452
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,379
Bailey, you can tell the firemen
to get my guys out of there.

453
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,922
Will do. OK. We're ready.

454
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:23,591
- O'Malley.
- Yes, sir?

455
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:26,186
You just flew solo.

456
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,197
Thank you, sir.

457
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,808
OK, Anna, we're going
to shut off the PCA pump now,

458
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,908
which means you'll be in a lot of pain
for the duration of...

459
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,419
- The healing ritual.
- Are you OK with that?

460
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:53,947
Yeah. They can't find my soul
if I'm medicated.

461
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,926
- No pain, no gain, right?
- It's not just for your father.

462
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,963
You believe it too, right?

463
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:03,228
I know it sounds like a load of crap
but watch the ritual. You'll see.

464
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,737
- See what?
- The moment it happens.

465
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,519
I'm ready.

466
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:39,567
"Oh, yes! I'm so very, very naughty,"

467
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:43,334
Bianca said
as she dropped her stethoscope.

468
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:48,573
"Me too!" said Crystal
as she snapped on her surgical glove.

469
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:51,114
And then there was Marta...

470
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,727
- Where was I?
- Marta.

471
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:09,461
Oh, yes. Marta was the naughtiest nurse
of all because she knew how...

472
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:13,366
- Oh, thank God.
- We're back up.

473
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:29,579
How long do you think it takes
to retrieve a lost soul?

474
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,651
I don't know.

475
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:40,391
- Way to go, George.
- I have my finger in a heart.

476
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:42,695
Very cool.

477
00:31:56,714 --> 00:32:00,115
- You have stress cardiomyopathy.
- Cardiomyopathy?

478
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:03,915
- What... Can you tell me what that is?
- It's Ted.

479
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,755
Ted?

480
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:10,260
Ted. Not just the neighbor
you barely knew, was he?

481
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:13,960
I don't know what you're talking about.

482
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:19,095
Every year, on the day he died, you get
a rush of adrenaline caused by stress.

483
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:24,938
Your pressure rises, you have chest
pains... and you end up here.

484
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,038
27 years.

485
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:33,614
I loved the man next door,
and he loved me.

486
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:39,486
I know how this is gonna sound but...
Ted was my soul mate.

487
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,490
And then he just died.

488
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:48,358
It's grief.

489
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:51,630
Your heart stops
because you're grieving for Ted.

490
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:56,231
So... what do I do next?

491
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,901
I mean, how do you treat it?

492
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:04,604
I wish I knew.

493
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:47,014
I told Thatch I'm leaving him.

494
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:52,290
You left Thatcher, Ellis, but
I couldn't bring myself to leave Adele.

495
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,354
Do you remember?

496
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,530
Painted horses.

497
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:04,237
Yes. We were on the carousel
in the park. It was raining.

498
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:09,511
- I have an offer from Boston General.
- You took it to get away.

499
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:13,072
We swore we'd never talk again
about what we had together.

500
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,176
It was gonna always be our secret.

501
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,454
Richard?

502
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,787
Yes, Ellis?

503
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,826
Carousels give me the creeps.

504
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,527
How do you put up with it?

505
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:32,865
I mean, <i>Nasty, Naughty Nurses 4</i>
and, I'm assuming, <i>1, 2</i> and <i>3.</i>

506
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:35,269
- He's my Henry.
- I know.

507
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:38,740
But don't you find it misogynistic
and degrading and kind of...

508
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,506
I mean, 24 hours a day of porn?

509
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,706
Seriously? That's your life?

510
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:46,409
I'm grateful for it.
It takes away his pain.

511
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:49,885
See, the thing is, Henry...

512
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:52,013
Henry takes away my pain.

513
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,088
I lied.

514
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,789
I'm not out
of this relationship, I'm in.

515
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:09,424
I'm so in, it's humiliating,
because here I am begging.

516
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,491
- Meredith...
- Shut up.

517
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,537
You say Meredith and I yell, remember?

518
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:17,870
- Yeah.
- OK. Here it is.

519
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:21,605
Your choice? It's simple. Her or me.

520
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:28,277
And I'm sure she's really great...
but, Derek, I love you.

521
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:34,988
In a really, really big,
"pretend to like your taste in music,

522
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,823
let you eat
the last piece of cheesecake,

523
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:40,921
hold a radio over my head
outside your window,"

524
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:44,832
unfortunate way
that makes me hate you, love you.

525
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:46,767
So pick me.

526
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:48,896
Choose me.

527
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:51,237
Love me.

528
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,874
I'll be at Joe's tonight.

529
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:01,749
So, if you do decide to sign the papers,
meet me there.

530
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:33,106
Goodbye, Ellis.

531
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,989
I am gonna come see you tomorrow, OK?

532
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,260
He doesn't love her.

533
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,554
He can't.

534
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,499
But he'll stay with her anyway.
She's his wife.

535
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:54,270
Mom?

536
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,901
- Mommy.
- Meredith.

537
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,313
- You grew up.
- I did.

538
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:08,240
It's a shame.
It's awful being a grownup.

539
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:12,322
But the carousel never stops turning.

540
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,715
You can't get off.

541
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,129
OK.

542
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,538
You think he'll show?

543
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,514
He'll show.

544
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,279
Hey.

545
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,799
How's your patient?

546
00:38:56,867 --> 00:39:00,564
- The one that got her soul back?
- She's going to be fine.

547
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:03,801
- Gotta go.
- Look at you. You look like a girl.

548
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:06,672
- Is that your date?
- That's my husband.

549
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:09,144
- You're married?
- Ten years today.

550
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,375
- I didn't know you were married.
- You never asked.

551
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,952
You haven't signed
those divorce papers yet, have you?

552
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:24,126
Bailey. Tell me what to do.

553
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,095
- God, why does this have to be so hard?
- It's not hard.

554
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,965
It's painful but it's not hard.

555
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:36,029
Come on, you know what to do already.

556
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:39,440
If you didn't,
you wouldn't be in so much pain.

557
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,821
<i> Pain.</i>
<i>You just have to ride it out.</i>

558
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,947
<i>Hope it goes away on its own.</i>

559
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:56,186
<i>Hope the wound that caused it heals.</i>

560
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,353
So here's where we are.

561
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:01,830
I work too much,
I'm competitive, I'm always right.

562
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,595
- And I snore.
- What?

563
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:07,833
I'm trying here.

564
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,305
Oh... Oh.

565
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:11,739
Oh!

566
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,875
- Yeah.
- So?

567
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,615
OK, we're a couple.

568
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:22,447
Whatever.
Don't make a big deal about it.

569
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,232
<i>There are no solutions.</i>

570
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,359
<i>No easy answers.</i>

571
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:42,602
<i>You just breathe deep</i>
<i>and wait for it to subside.</i>

572
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,971
Oh, man. I just...

573
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:52,544
He's not coming.

574
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:59,081
- You don't think he's coming.
- He might come.

575
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:03,149
- Yeah. You never know.
- He's definitely coming.

576
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,319
Ow!

577
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:08,456
Want her doing tequila shots all night?
I'll be the one cleaning up the vomit.

578
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:11,899
Besides, I touched a heart today, Porny.

579
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:26,049
<i> Most of the time,</i>
<i>pain can be managed.</i>

580
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,381
Pour me another one.

581
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:34,015
<i>But sometimes, the pain gets you</i>
<i>when you least expect it.</i>

582
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,423
I'm telling you. Any second.

583
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:42,029
<i>Hits way below the belt</i>
<i>and doesn't let up.</i>

584
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:50,596
I have been looking...
everywhere for you.

585
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,369
Well...

586
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,540
- You found me.
- So...

587
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:59,549
you going to sign
those divorce papers or not?

588
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:06,047
<i>Pain. You just have to fight through.</i>

589
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:09,115
<i>Because the truth is</i>
<i>you can't outrun it.</i>

590
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,858
<i>And life always makes more.</i>
