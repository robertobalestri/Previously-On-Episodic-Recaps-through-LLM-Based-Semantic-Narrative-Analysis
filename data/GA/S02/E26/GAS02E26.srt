1
00:00:06,062 --> 00:00:09,759
<i>Human beings
need a lot of things to feel alive.</i>

2
00:00:11,868 --> 00:00:13,130
<i>Family.</i>

3
00:00:13,203 --> 00:00:14,693
<i>Love.</i>

4
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:16,295
<i>Sex.</i>

5
00:00:16,806 --> 00:00:18,603
<i>But we only need one thing...</i>

6
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:20,472
<i>To actually be alive.</i>

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,405
<i>We need a beating heart.</i>

8
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:30,609
<i>When our heart is threatened...</i>

9
00:00:30,687 --> 00:00:32,917
<i>We respond in one of two ways.</i>

10
00:00:34,057 --> 00:00:36,252
<i>- We either run...
- Or...</i>

11
00:00:39,095 --> 00:00:40,357
<i>We attack.</i>

12
00:00:42,198 --> 00:00:44,632
<i>There's a scientific term for this.</i>

13
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:47,067
<i>- Fight...
- Or flight.</i>

14
00:00:47,136 --> 00:00:48,797
<i>It's instinct.</i>

15
00:00:54,244 --> 00:00:56,371
<i>We can't control it.</i>

16
00:01:00,316 --> 00:01:02,045
<i>Or can we?</i>

17
00:01:02,118 --> 00:01:04,086
Izzie.

18
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:09,847
His heart's barely beating.
We need to call a code.

19
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,758
I can't feel a pulse.
Izzie, we need to call a code!

20
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:15,662
- No! I have a plan.
- He's crashing! I need to call the...

21
00:01:15,732 --> 00:01:20,066
No! If we call a code, they will rush
him to surgery and replace his LVAD

22
00:01:20,136 --> 00:01:23,105
and he will stabilize.
He needs to get worse to get this heart.

23
00:01:23,172 --> 00:01:25,970
- Izzie, this is crazy.
- He has to get this heart.

24
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:28,476
He will die waiting for another chance.

25
00:01:28,544 --> 00:01:30,205
- We have to call a code!
- No!

26
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,242
You press that code button,
I will hurt you.

27
00:01:33,316 --> 00:01:36,410
Not a lot, 'cause we're friends,
but enough so that things will break

28
00:01:36,486 --> 00:01:38,579
and you lie on the floor out of my way.

29
00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:41,089
- Izzie...
- You have a decision to make.

30
00:01:41,157 --> 00:01:44,183
You can stay here and help me with this
or you can go.

31
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:46,695
What's it gonna be, George?

32
00:01:49,465 --> 00:01:51,956
Chief!
How bad is it? It looks bad.

33
00:01:52,035 --> 00:01:55,061
I'm here. I can help. If there's
anything surgical, I can help.

34
00:01:55,138 --> 00:01:57,072
Why don't you go run Trauma 2,
Dr. Yang?

35
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,903
I get to run Trauma 2 all by myself?

36
00:01:58,975 --> 00:02:01,409
Yes, but find me if you need help.
And get consults.

37
00:02:01,477 --> 00:02:02,876
I'm on it!

38
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:11,814
- How bad is it?
- Uh, GSW to the right shoulder.

39
00:02:11,888 --> 00:02:13,947
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- Get him to Trauma 1

40
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:16,355
and keep the blinds closed.
Yang's on the floor.

41
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:21,653
Self-inflicted GSW to the head.
Pulse is thready.

42
00:02:21,731 --> 00:02:24,632
- This is the shooter?
- Emptied his clip, then shot himself.

43
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:26,896
And blew off half his head. OK, OK.

44
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:29,597
Um, push one of epi
and get him on the monitor.

45
00:02:29,672 --> 00:02:32,197
- You're running this?
- Damn right, I am.

46
00:02:33,743 --> 00:02:35,870
- Hey. Wait.
- I'm fine.

47
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:37,810
Lay down. You lost a lot of blood.

48
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,839
I'm fine. Let go. I'm fine! I have
a patient that I have to go check on.

49
00:02:41,918 --> 00:02:44,284
No, no.
No, you are the patient. Lay down!

50
00:02:48,157 --> 00:02:50,682
Dr. Bailey, when did you get here?

51
00:02:51,794 --> 00:02:53,694
Page Shepherd.

52
00:03:07,477 --> 00:03:09,468
Take over compressions.

53
00:03:18,287 --> 00:03:20,016
- You're shot?
- Cristina?

54
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:22,182
- Back to your station.
- He's shot?

55
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:24,453
- Yang, we got it. It's OK.
- That guy shot you.

56
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:27,919
- Move.
- He's a lost cause.

57
00:03:27,997 --> 00:03:30,761
- He's circling the drain.
- You don't get to kill yourself.

58
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,301
You do not get off that easily.
Push high-dose epi.

59
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:35,269
- Dr. Yang...
- What?

60
00:03:35,338 --> 00:03:38,136
I want to be able to tell his family
I did everything I could

61
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:41,608
to save his pathetic, miserable life.
Give him three of epi. Now!

62
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:47,779
We should be hearing
from Dr. Burke any minute.

63
00:03:49,786 --> 00:03:52,346
That's what you said half an hour ago.

64
00:03:52,422 --> 00:03:54,515
Well, whether or not we hear from him,

65
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,388
we hit that hour mark,
I'm going in to get my heart.

66
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,835
- OK, no exit wound.
- Entry upper right shoulder.

67
00:04:07,603 --> 00:04:10,504
Could be lodged in the spine.
OK, let's roll him over.

68
00:04:10,573 --> 00:04:12,564
- Easy.
- Watch the arm.

69
00:04:12,642 --> 00:04:14,041
- Easy.
- Dr. Burke?

70
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,544
- Hmm?
- The bullet is in dangerous property.

71
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:20,173
- We need to check your hand function.
- Try and squeeze my fingers, OK?

72
00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:27,751
- They moved my guy upstairs. How is he?
- Wait outside.

73
00:04:27,824 --> 00:04:30,019
I'm not going to wait outside. Burke?

74
00:04:32,462 --> 00:04:34,555
Can we have a moment?

75
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:39,258
Only a moment.
I don't want to waste any time. OK?

76
00:04:41,204 --> 00:04:44,037
- Cristina.
- Honey, you don't have to say anything.

77
00:04:44,106 --> 00:04:46,199
I know you're sorry.

78
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:49,642
I know you didn't mean to kick me off
the transplant and I'm not mad.

79
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,445
I mean, I was, but I'm not anymore,
so don't worry about it.

80
00:04:54,517 --> 00:04:56,678
Don't even think about it. OK?

81
00:04:56,752 --> 00:05:00,279
I mean, all that matters is that you
get better and you get through this.

82
00:05:01,524 --> 00:05:04,823
And I'm here for you.
Whatever you need. Anything.

83
00:05:08,364 --> 00:05:09,956
I need...

84
00:05:10,032 --> 00:05:12,125
you... to... to go...

85
00:05:14,403 --> 00:05:16,701
to check on Denny Duquette.

86
00:05:20,109 --> 00:05:22,077
OK.

87
00:05:23,346 --> 00:05:25,473
OK, that was
my best "supportive girlfriend"

88
00:05:25,548 --> 00:05:28,210
and you kind of ruined it
with medicine. OK?

89
00:05:31,153 --> 00:05:33,883
Addison! Thank you for meeting us.

90
00:05:33,956 --> 00:05:37,357
What's so important I'm keeping it
secret from my Chief of Surgery?

91
00:05:37,426 --> 00:05:42,295
I was chaperoning a prom for my niece.
We had a little bit of a situation.

92
00:05:42,365 --> 00:05:46,665
Camille Travis, 17, lost consciousness
during sexual intercourse?

93
00:05:46,736 --> 00:05:50,263
- Oh, keep it down.
- It's OK, Aunt Adele. I'm fine.

94
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:53,775
When your Uncle Richard finds out
you were cashing in your V-card,

95
00:05:53,843 --> 00:05:55,811
- none of us will be fine.
- Camille?

96
00:05:55,878 --> 00:05:58,278
- Mrs. Webber!
- My God! Is she OK?

97
00:05:58,347 --> 00:06:00,907
No one ever died from having sex, right?

98
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:04,817
You're not going to tell my parents,
right? I used a condom and everything.

99
00:06:10,059 --> 00:06:12,118
George's page said it was an emergency.

100
00:06:12,194 --> 00:06:14,287
- You paged Meredith?
- We need help!

101
00:06:14,363 --> 00:06:16,888
- What the hell is going on?
- What the hell is going on?

102
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:19,560
- Exactly what I said.
- She cut his LVAD wires!

103
00:06:19,635 --> 00:06:21,626
Are you trying to kill him?

104
00:06:21,704 --> 00:06:26,141
I'm trying to save him. All I have to do
is confirm that his condition is worse,

105
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:30,167
then Burke can call UNOS and he'll move
up on the list and will get his heart.

106
00:06:30,246 --> 00:06:32,373
- About Burke...
- She's gone insane, right?

107
00:06:32,448 --> 00:06:34,313
- About Burke...
- It will be fine!

108
00:06:34,383 --> 00:06:36,908
- Izzie!
- When Burke gets here,

109
00:06:36,986 --> 00:06:39,853
- he will know what to do.
- About Burke...

110
00:06:39,922 --> 00:06:42,083
- What?
- He's been shot!

111
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,424
- Burke's not coming?
- Cristina, are you OK?

112
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:52,160
- I'm fine.
- Burke's not coming?

113
00:06:52,234 --> 00:06:55,829
Why didn't I take the internship in San
Diego? None of this would be happening.

114
00:06:55,905 --> 00:06:59,636
- Burke's not coming!
- No, Izzie. Burke is not coming.

115
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:02,507
I know you have problems
with your possible murder charges

116
00:07:02,578 --> 00:07:04,569
and stupid idea about stealing a heart,

117
00:07:04,647 --> 00:07:06,842
but Burke's kind of busy right now!

118
00:07:07,783 --> 00:07:11,344
Denny's going to die.
Denny's going to die and I killed him.

119
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,911
You shouldn't have done it!
We have to tell someone.

120
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,686
Denny won't get the heart
and Izzie'll get kicked out.

121
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,987
- I'm leaving.
- Cristina!

122
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,186
Burke could die, too.

123
00:07:19,261 --> 00:07:22,788
Complications arise all the time
because of gunshot wounds!

124
00:07:22,865 --> 00:07:23,889
Oh, my God.

125
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:27,595
- If you were thinking with your head...
- I did what I thought was best!

126
00:07:29,605 --> 00:07:33,097
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

127
00:07:34,877 --> 00:07:38,870
No one is leaving. And no one is dying.

128
00:07:38,948 --> 00:07:41,041
Thank you.

129
00:07:41,117 --> 00:07:44,575
It was kind of getting on my nerves,
all this dying talk.

130
00:07:44,654 --> 00:07:46,485
Denny.

131
00:07:46,555 --> 00:07:48,352
It's OK.

132
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:51,723
I think, uh,
maybe we should all listen to Meredith.

133
00:07:51,794 --> 00:07:54,854
- It looks like she might have a plan.
- You have a plan?

134
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:57,455
Just give me a minute.

135
00:08:00,536 --> 00:08:03,994
- You girls should go back to the prom.
- Will you call Camille's parents?

136
00:08:04,073 --> 00:08:08,237
Not until I have to. You know her mom.
She gets a little hysterical.

137
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:11,806
- Brian, disappear.
- What?

138
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:14,441
Go! Disappear! Richard.

139
00:08:14,517 --> 00:08:16,644
- Richard.
- Adele.

140
00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:20,314
- Hmm.
- What? Are you here to see Preston?

141
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:23,483
- No. What happened to Preston?
- Preston was shot.

142
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:26,323
- Preston was shot?
- Yeah.

143
00:08:26,395 --> 00:08:28,955
Camille. What happened to Camille?

144
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:31,556
- Why didn't you call me?
- She's 17, sweetheart.

145
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:34,660
She'll be 18 in a few months.
Most girls lose it way before...

146
00:08:34,737 --> 00:08:37,467
Uh-huh!
Do you think I want to hear that?

147
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:41,203
Do you think I want to picture
my baby niece... "losing it"?

148
00:08:41,277 --> 00:08:43,177
Richard, Richard, take deep breaths.

149
00:08:43,245 --> 00:08:47,341
Well, the bleeding has stopped,
but her pelvic exam does concern me.

150
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,883
I'd like to do an ultrasound.

151
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:52,443
Three years ago, Camille was diagnosed
with ovarian cancer.

152
00:08:53,422 --> 00:08:56,585
They only removed one ovary
to try and preserve fertility,

153
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:59,389
but her checkups
have been clean since then.

154
00:08:59,462 --> 00:09:03,091
OK. Well, let's not worry
until we have to.

155
00:09:08,771 --> 00:09:11,331
You! You wait right there!
I want to talk to you!

156
00:09:11,407 --> 00:09:15,741
- I said wait. Stop! I said stop!
- Richard, take deep breaths! Richard!

157
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:18,678
- Oh, that's a stupid plan!
- Well, if Burke isn't coming,

158
00:09:18,748 --> 00:09:21,546
then we have to confirm Denny's
condition ourselves.

159
00:09:21,617 --> 00:09:24,085
We get the blood work. We do the echo.

160
00:09:24,153 --> 00:09:25,984
No one even has to know what Izzie did.

161
00:09:26,055 --> 00:09:27,920
None of us have done an echo
on our own.

162
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,981
Cristina has. Burke taught her.

163
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,424
- I'm not involved.
- What if this were Burke?

164
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:35,464
- What if you were me?
- This is bad.

165
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:38,056
This is bad and serious
and against a lot of rules.

166
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:40,329
- It's not fun for me.
- What if you were me?

167
00:09:40,402 --> 00:09:43,064
- I wouldn't fall for a patient.
- You fell for an attending.

168
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:46,040
- What's the point?
- We can't help who we fall for.

169
00:09:46,108 --> 00:09:47,769
Yeah.

170
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:50,405
Yeah.

171
00:09:58,921 --> 00:10:00,513
His hands are cold.

172
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:04,025
- My hands are always cold.
- Your hand is cold, Preston.

173
00:10:04,093 --> 00:10:06,084
I have cold hands.

174
00:10:12,868 --> 00:10:16,065
Bullet could be lodged in
the brachial plexus. That's dangerous.

175
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:17,537
Very dangerous.

176
00:10:17,606 --> 00:10:19,665
My hands are always cold.

177
00:10:19,742 --> 00:10:21,767
We'll have to do an angiogram.

178
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:23,778
I'm always cold.

179
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,381
Trachea's deviated to the right!

180
00:10:29,451 --> 00:10:31,942
Absent breath sounds
on the right side! Let's go!

181
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:33,545
14-gage angio.

182
00:10:33,622 --> 00:10:35,055
Let's hurry.

183
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:39,827
Dr. Burke? You gotta stay with me now.
There you go.

184
00:10:39,895 --> 00:10:43,092
That's it! There you go! You're
all right. Right here. Right here.

185
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:46,130
Your lung collapsed. You're OK.

186
00:10:48,604 --> 00:10:50,401
You're OK now.

187
00:10:53,676 --> 00:10:55,803
He's been shot? Dude.

188
00:10:55,878 --> 00:10:57,903
We'll have to run these tests ourselves.

189
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,642
UNOS gave us an hour.
In a couple of minutes, our time is up.

190
00:11:00,716 --> 00:11:03,549
This chick is hardcore.
She's not gonna wait.

191
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:07,282
<i>- OK, well, you just have to stall her.
- I'm not getting involved with this.</i>

192
00:11:07,356 --> 00:11:10,450
I don't care if that drawling
bedridden whiner ever gets a heart.

193
00:11:10,526 --> 00:11:13,893
Alex. Do this. For Izzie.

194
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:18,257
I'm not guaranteeing anything.

195
00:11:18,934 --> 00:11:22,097
So... was it totally romantic?

196
00:11:22,705 --> 00:11:26,641
Yeah, before... the pain
and the paramedics and everything?

197
00:11:28,143 --> 00:11:30,407
OK, so...

198
00:11:31,113 --> 00:11:35,015
you know that feeling
when you look into someone's eyes

199
00:11:35,084 --> 00:11:37,484
and you're totally comfortable

200
00:11:37,553 --> 00:11:42,855
and you aren't self-conscious and
everything just... is, like, perfect?

201
00:11:44,026 --> 00:11:48,463
Camille, have you had any symptoms,
um... any abdominal pain?

202
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,395
Nausea?

203
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,668
- Anything?
- No, she's been fine.

204
00:11:55,304 --> 00:11:57,067
You haven't been fine, have you?

205
00:11:59,742 --> 00:12:01,835
No, not for, like, a month or so.

206
00:12:01,911 --> 00:12:03,902
You've been feeling sick for a month?

207
00:12:05,347 --> 00:12:09,784
I wanted to go to prom. I, I... I didn't
want to be the girl with cancer, again.

208
00:12:11,553 --> 00:12:15,114
You're not. She's not, right?

209
00:12:27,169 --> 00:12:28,431
Hey.

210
00:12:28,504 --> 00:12:29,835
Oh.

211
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:34,466
I was just trying to remember
the night I lost my virginity.

212
00:12:35,277 --> 00:12:37,643
And I can't.

213
00:12:40,382 --> 00:12:42,373
I remember who it was with

214
00:12:42,451 --> 00:12:46,444
and I remember I was 18,

215
00:12:46,522 --> 00:12:50,891
but... I can't remember
any of the details.

216
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,292
I can remember all of the details.

217
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:56,420
- Kind of wish I couldn't.
- That bad?

218
00:12:56,498 --> 00:12:58,432
No, just not good.

219
00:13:00,102 --> 00:13:03,401
Good came later.
And then really good came.

220
00:13:09,678 --> 00:13:12,704
That little girl in there's
just getting started.

221
00:13:12,781 --> 00:13:17,218
She hasn't even seen what good is yet.

222
00:13:20,022 --> 00:13:22,149
Please. Addison.

223
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:29,425
Tell me she's going to have a chance
to see what the good stuff is.

224
00:13:35,537 --> 00:13:36,936
Oh.

225
00:13:37,006 --> 00:13:38,997
I'm so sorry, Adele.

226
00:13:43,979 --> 00:13:45,674
How's his heart looking?

227
00:13:45,748 --> 00:13:49,081
His left ventricle's shot
and he's barely pushing blood out.

228
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:53,276
I'm sorry. I know that you're worried
about Burke.

229
00:13:53,355 --> 00:13:55,346
You know, whatever. It's fine.

230
00:13:57,059 --> 00:13:59,755
Cristina, can't you just
try to understand?

231
00:14:00,996 --> 00:14:02,520
I love him.

232
00:14:03,432 --> 00:14:06,026
- You don't even know him.
- I do know him.

233
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:09,332
You've never even seen him outside
this hospital. You don't know him.

234
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:14,536
I know him. Maybe I don't live with him
or work with him like you do with Burke,

235
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:20,173
but I do know him.
And there's... there's possibility here.

236
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,344
And given the choice of running
or staying...

237
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,413
You should run. A sane person,
a person who values her career

238
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,185
and everything she's worked for,

239
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:34,059
a person who values her own heart,
for God's sake... that person would run.

240
00:14:35,597 --> 00:14:37,690
A sane person...

241
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:39,290
would marry me.

242
00:14:41,236 --> 00:14:43,796
What? What did you say?

243
00:14:43,872 --> 00:14:45,533
What did he say?

244
00:14:48,444 --> 00:14:51,811
He said marry me?
He said marry me, right?

245
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,873
- He did.
- Denny. Wake up. Denny.

246
00:14:58,987 --> 00:15:01,785
- What's happening?
- I'm pumping harder. I don't know.

247
00:15:04,426 --> 00:15:06,360
- He's flatline!
- He's not flatline.

248
00:15:06,428 --> 00:15:09,261
There's movement in his heart.
OK, um, uh, let's shock him.

249
00:15:09,331 --> 00:15:11,731
- Charge the defibrillator.
- Ventilate, George!

250
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,825
- I am.
- Charging to 200!

251
00:15:14,736 --> 00:15:16,465
- You got it?
- Yeah.

252
00:15:17,106 --> 00:15:18,505
Clear!

253
00:15:20,109 --> 00:15:22,100
- Is Dr. Burke alive?
- Yes.

254
00:15:22,177 --> 00:15:24,805
Shame.
He'd probably have made a good donor.

255
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,611
OK, people, let's get our organs
and get out of here.

256
00:15:28,684 --> 00:15:31,983
That heart is not yours. Seattle Grace
is still waiting for test results.

257
00:15:32,054 --> 00:15:34,022
Well, I'm not. Ten blade.

258
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,180
You can't do that.

259
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,288
I just did.

260
00:15:42,131 --> 00:15:43,496
Girls.

261
00:15:43,565 --> 00:15:45,931
Um, I called Jillian.

262
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:47,400
And I called Tessa.

263
00:15:47,469 --> 00:15:49,664
And they called Simon and Bianca
and Deborah.

264
00:15:49,738 --> 00:15:52,002
- Girls...
- It's her prom, Dr. Webber.

265
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:56,508
She can't miss her whole prom!
So... we, like, brought it to her.

266
00:15:59,615 --> 00:16:00,946
Kids!

267
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:03,944
Kids! Listen up.

268
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,146
Look,
I know you wanted to see Camille.

269
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:11,053
Why don't you come back tomorrow?
During the day. In smaller groups.

270
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:15,597
Look, I'm sorry, girls.

271
00:16:15,664 --> 00:16:19,031
I can't have a bunch of teenagers
running in the hallways.

272
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:21,433
People are sick. People are d...

273
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,868
Dying?

274
00:16:23,672 --> 00:16:25,230
Yeah, we know.

275
00:16:37,386 --> 00:16:39,286
How're you doing?

276
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:44,448
I'm developing numbness in my...
fourth and fifth fingers.

277
00:16:45,727 --> 00:16:49,288
And there's a pseudoaneurysm
in the subclavian artery.

278
00:16:50,766 --> 00:16:52,961
You know the drill.

279
00:16:53,035 --> 00:16:56,766
Wait a few days,
maybe the aneurysm won't grow.

280
00:16:56,838 --> 00:17:00,001
Yeah, if... if it stays this size,
there's too much damage.

281
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:05,236
We'll just go in there and we'll fix it.
Relieve the compression on the nerves.

282
00:17:05,314 --> 00:17:08,841
But the operation
could cause damage to the nerves.

283
00:17:10,652 --> 00:17:12,210
Yes.

284
00:17:12,287 --> 00:17:15,552
And I could...
lose function of the entire arm.

285
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,053
Yes.

286
00:17:21,163 --> 00:17:24,758
You can do this?
You're good enough to do this?

287
00:17:30,405 --> 00:17:32,236
I think so.

288
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:36,442
- But you're not sure.
- But I'm not sure.

289
00:17:42,117 --> 00:17:44,051
So...

290
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:46,349
what do I do?

291
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,718
It's not like you
to ask those kinds of questions.

292
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:52,987
It's not like you
not to have the answers.

293
00:17:59,768 --> 00:18:02,066
How dare you send those kids away?

294
00:18:02,137 --> 00:18:05,129
Adele. Please. You're emotional. OK?

295
00:18:05,907 --> 00:18:09,536
I just told my sister
her baby's cancer is back.

296
00:18:09,611 --> 00:18:12,239
You're damn right, I'm emotional!

297
00:18:12,314 --> 00:18:16,774
If you don't want to bend
your precious rules for Camille, fine.

298
00:18:16,852 --> 00:18:18,717
Don't do it for her. Do it for me.

299
00:18:18,787 --> 00:18:21,381
Do it for your wife
who never asks you for anything.

300
00:18:21,456 --> 00:18:23,390
Who says nothing about your long hours.

301
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,552
Who looks the other way while
you have an affair with another woman.

302
00:18:26,628 --> 00:18:29,028
Who sobered you up
when that woman left you.

303
00:18:29,097 --> 00:18:32,726
Who stayed with you when everyone
said I would be better off alone.

304
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:37,636
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you,
you're going to make this up to Camille.

305
00:18:37,706 --> 00:18:40,504
You're going to prioritize
the needs of your family

306
00:18:40,575 --> 00:18:42,805
above those of your other patients.

307
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:47,815
Or... you're going to find
a new place to sleep.

308
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,187
- Derek.
- Not now, Addison.

309
00:18:57,259 --> 00:18:58,920
- Derek.
- Not now.

310
00:19:07,035 --> 00:19:09,936
There's never a good place to hide
in this hospital.

311
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:20,742
I'm trying to get perspective.
Everything feels enormous.

312
00:19:20,816 --> 00:19:24,183
Like it's all just...
I... I can't get perspective.

313
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,251
My niece's cancer has come back.

314
00:19:31,193 --> 00:19:34,026
She's 17 years old
and she's going to die.

315
00:19:40,102 --> 00:19:41,433
Plus...

316
00:19:42,971 --> 00:19:46,372
25 years ago,
I had a secret affair with...

317
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:49,540
Ellis Grey.

318
00:19:50,545 --> 00:19:55,278
And today, I find out that my wife
knew the entire time.

319
00:19:56,651 --> 00:19:59,051
There was no... secret.

320
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,117
And she stayed with me.

321
00:20:04,192 --> 00:20:05,523
Hmm.

322
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:12,994
I respect him, you know?

323
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:16,234
Dr. Burke. I...

324
00:20:17,105 --> 00:20:19,539
I respect him.
He is decent. He's honorable.

325
00:20:20,742 --> 00:20:23,939
An arrogant ass who just hogs the OR
and thinks he's God, but...

326
00:20:26,882 --> 00:20:29,214
he's decent and he's honorable.

327
00:20:30,051 --> 00:20:31,916
I respect him.

328
00:20:34,856 --> 00:20:39,350
He's one of the foremost cardiothoracic
surgeons in the country and I have to...

329
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:45,222
It's his hand.

330
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:50,162
I cannot get perspective.

331
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,138
I can't do this.
I can't be responsible for him.

332
00:20:56,044 --> 00:20:59,639
Preston's an honorable and decent man,
but, Derek, so are you.

333
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:06,320
You are honorable and decent. And
you're too honorable and decent to run.

334
00:21:11,693 --> 00:21:14,890
You don't know how much
I wish this was bourbon.

335
00:21:27,843 --> 00:21:30,277
Anything I can get for you, Dr. Burke?

336
00:21:31,146 --> 00:21:33,011
No. I'm fine.

337
00:21:33,081 --> 00:21:35,606
Um, there... there must be something.

338
00:21:37,385 --> 00:21:40,411
It would be nice...
to have some ice chips.

339
00:21:42,824 --> 00:21:45,657
And a touch of morphine if I'm allowed.

340
00:21:49,731 --> 00:21:51,289
And, uh...

341
00:21:53,468 --> 00:21:55,197
Cristina.

342
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,831
Coming right up.

343
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:05,910
Where is Cristina?

344
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:08,779
Where are...
where are all of the suck-ups?

345
00:22:09,818 --> 00:22:11,752
Excuse me?

346
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:17,690
My interns. My ass-kissing,
surgery-hungry, competitive suck-ups.

347
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,492
Where are they? Why aren't they here
fetching you ice chips and morphine?

348
00:22:23,598 --> 00:22:25,429
Why aren't they here sucking up?

349
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,897
You know something.

350
00:22:30,972 --> 00:22:33,839
- I'm a patient.
- Preston Xavier Burke...

351
00:22:35,877 --> 00:22:37,936
what have you done with my suck-ups?

352
00:22:38,013 --> 00:22:39,947
What do we do? What do we do?

353
00:22:40,015 --> 00:22:43,781
I'm starting dopamine and dobutamine
drips. We can use those together, right?

354
00:22:43,852 --> 00:22:45,149
- Milrinone?
- I don't know.

355
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,586
None of us do.
Start the dobutamine and dopamine.

356
00:22:47,656 --> 00:22:49,851
I feel like my chest
is running away.

357
00:22:49,925 --> 00:22:52,120
- His heart rate's 217.
- He's in SVT!

358
00:22:52,193 --> 00:22:54,161
No, no. Izzie, stop pumping. Stop.

359
00:22:54,229 --> 00:22:56,424
- No change.
- We need that medicine!

360
00:22:56,498 --> 00:22:58,261
- What medicine?
- I'll know when I see it.

361
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,994
The one that stops the heart.

362
00:23:00,068 --> 00:23:02,400
No. The whole point
is to keep my heart beating.

363
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,062
It only stops it for six seconds.

364
00:23:04,139 --> 00:23:06,733
- It's adenosine!
- Uh, his heart is speeding up! Guys!

365
00:23:06,808 --> 00:23:09,606
We have to do something!
He cannot take this for much longer.

366
00:23:09,678 --> 00:23:11,441
- What about shocking him?
- Found it!

367
00:23:11,513 --> 00:23:14,107
Cristina, come over here.
Lift up his arm.

368
00:23:14,182 --> 00:23:18,243
The nurses lift the arm when they push
adenosine. It gets to the heart faster.

369
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,481
- Denny. You're going to feel, um...
- Izzie!

370
00:23:20,555 --> 00:23:22,386
No, it's OK. It just feels like...

371
00:23:22,457 --> 00:23:25,426
- I'm gonna die.
- You're not, I promise. It's the meds.

372
00:23:25,493 --> 00:23:28,656
- Are you sure we used the right drugs?
- The book said it was right.

373
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,164
- I used the one I know!
- He's not going to die, right?

374
00:23:31,232 --> 00:23:32,665
Right? Right?

375
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:53,910
You fools better have
a good explanation for this.

376
00:23:58,393 --> 00:23:59,985
Step away from the patient.

377
00:24:02,864 --> 00:24:05,560
Step away from the patient!

378
00:24:05,634 --> 00:24:08,797
I can't. I have to pump his heart.

379
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:16,442
Olivia, take over for Dr. Stevens.

380
00:24:16,511 --> 00:24:19,742
Izzie, you're done here.
I need you to leave the room.

381
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,320
- Izzie...
- No! Do not touch me!

382
00:24:39,534 --> 00:24:44,733
Olivia, stay with Dr. Stevens.
Help her if she'll let you.

383
00:24:46,107 --> 00:24:49,270
You three. Outside. Now!

384
00:24:54,382 --> 00:24:58,216
Where was rational thought?
Where was cognitive thinking?

385
00:24:58,286 --> 00:25:01,517
First do no harm?
The morals, the ethics?

386
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:05,548
Where was sanity when you three
decided to help that girl?

387
00:25:05,627 --> 00:25:07,492
- We didn't...
- No, no. No speaking.

388
00:25:07,562 --> 00:25:10,895
I do not want to have to testify
against any of you in a court of law.

389
00:25:10,965 --> 00:25:12,432
Not one word.

390
00:25:16,171 --> 00:25:18,969
She cut his LVAD wire.

391
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,940
- I said no speaking.
- I didn't!

392
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:22,738
Then no moving!

393
00:25:24,813 --> 00:25:27,111
Cristina, Burke is asking for you. Go!

394
00:25:27,882 --> 00:25:29,941
I'm assuming you ran labs?

395
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,213
I'm asking a question.

396
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,919
- Answer me!
- You said no speak...

397
00:25:36,991 --> 00:25:38,982
- I know what I said!
- Yes.

398
00:25:39,594 --> 00:25:43,325
O'Malley, get me the lab results.
Do not pass go.

399
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:45,389
Do not talk to another living soul.

400
00:25:45,467 --> 00:25:47,458
Get the labs! Get back here!

401
00:25:48,336 --> 00:25:50,167
Grey...

402
00:25:52,373 --> 00:25:54,364
come with me.

403
00:26:07,722 --> 00:26:09,451
How are you?

404
00:26:09,524 --> 00:26:11,515
You look good.

405
00:26:12,761 --> 00:26:14,752
Are those your films?

406
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:26,566
Oh. Burke...

407
00:26:30,245 --> 00:26:34,511
Shepherd, uh...
doesn't know if he can fix my hand.

408
00:26:34,582 --> 00:26:38,951
Maybe I'll wait it out.
See if this numbness subsides.

409
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,453
Yeah.

410
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,581
Or I could let Shepherd operate.

411
00:26:46,261 --> 00:26:47,751
Yeah. Yeah.

412
00:26:49,397 --> 00:26:51,831
I could lose all hand function.

413
00:26:53,034 --> 00:26:55,662
What if I can never operate again?

414
00:26:55,737 --> 00:26:57,261
Yeah.

415
00:26:57,338 --> 00:26:58,999
- Cristina?
- Yeah?

416
00:26:59,073 --> 00:27:01,405
- Stop saying yeah.
- OK.

417
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,038
I need...

418
00:27:09,551 --> 00:27:11,041
I need...

419
00:27:12,053 --> 00:27:14,044
You said you were here.

420
00:27:15,723 --> 00:27:17,884
- For me.
- Yeah.

421
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:19,517
Oh, sorry.

422
00:27:20,061 --> 00:27:21,619
- Cristina.
- Hmm?

423
00:27:23,565 --> 00:27:28,434
I need you to tell me...
what you think I should do.

424
00:27:35,476 --> 00:27:36,807
I...

425
00:27:43,618 --> 00:27:46,985
L- I told Dr. Bailey
that I would be back.

426
00:27:47,589 --> 00:27:50,581
OK? L-I told her
that I wouldn't be long.

427
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,420
- Cristina...
- I'm-I'm-I'm going to think about it.

428
00:27:56,931 --> 00:27:58,660
I mean...

429
00:27:58,733 --> 00:28:01,099
I'm going to think about it. OK?

430
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:35,667
- How're you feeling, Denny?
- Really, really good.

431
00:28:35,737 --> 00:28:38,501
Like an athlete or a superhero.

432
00:28:38,573 --> 00:28:41,406
Or some other kind
of really healthy person.

433
00:28:41,476 --> 00:28:44,912
- You're funny. You're a funny guy.
- Izzie. No speaking.

434
00:28:47,448 --> 00:28:50,042
I cut my own LVAD wires, you know?

435
00:28:50,618 --> 00:28:53,348
I went rogue. All by myself.

436
00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:57,755
Shush. You're weak enough as it is.
Please don't waste energy on lying.

437
00:29:01,262 --> 00:29:04,754
- Dr. Bailey?
- I did indeed say no speaking.

438
00:29:04,832 --> 00:29:07,130
I don't care!

439
00:29:08,569 --> 00:29:10,400
He's going to get the heart, right?

440
00:29:10,471 --> 00:29:13,838
You're gonna sign the charts
and talk to the transplant coordinator?

441
00:29:15,043 --> 00:29:17,841
Here are the labs.

442
00:29:17,912 --> 00:29:21,348
See? See, his BUN and creatinine
are increasing.

443
00:29:21,416 --> 00:29:23,111
He clearly has pulmonary edema.

444
00:29:23,184 --> 00:29:25,379
He moves up to 1 A status
on the transplant list.

445
00:29:25,453 --> 00:29:27,683
UNOS will give him the heart.
You need to call...

446
00:29:27,755 --> 00:29:32,886
Isobel Stevens, I take my medical advice
from doctors. You are a visitor.

447
00:29:32,961 --> 00:29:36,021
- What?
- You are a visitor in this hospital.

448
00:29:36,097 --> 00:29:40,659
You will not be a doctor in this
hospital again until I decide you are.

449
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:43,533
Olivia, take over the heart pump.

450
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:04,918
He gets the heart, though, right?

451
00:30:05,827 --> 00:30:09,524
Sir? Uh, I need to ask
you a hypothetical question.

452
00:30:09,597 --> 00:30:11,394
Can we do this another time?

453
00:30:11,466 --> 00:30:13,957
Uh, if someone on the staff

454
00:30:14,035 --> 00:30:17,493
deliberately unhooked
a transplant candidate from his LVAD

455
00:30:17,572 --> 00:30:22,032
in an attempt to worsen his condition
and get him moved up the donor list?

456
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,271
Hypothetically, sir.

457
00:30:26,147 --> 00:30:29,048
I think you need to tell me
exactly what's going on here.

458
00:30:29,117 --> 00:30:31,950
Believe me, sir,
you want this to stay a hypothetical.

459
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,580
Because I'm thinking if that did happen,

460
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:37,886
you'd be duty-bound to report it
and the hospital would be in danger

461
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:40,723
of losing its accreditation
as a transplant site.

462
00:30:40,795 --> 00:30:42,194
So hypothetically?

463
00:30:42,263 --> 00:30:45,426
Hypothetically,
if the patient got worse,

464
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,698
would it be unethical for him to receive
the heart even though, medically,

465
00:30:49,771 --> 00:30:54,208
his worsened condition now puts him
at the top of the donor list?

466
00:30:54,275 --> 00:30:55,765
Hypothetically?

467
00:30:56,911 --> 00:30:58,538
How bad is he?

468
00:30:58,613 --> 00:31:02,549
In the few hours it would take a new
LVAD to be delivered, he'll be dead.

469
00:31:03,818 --> 00:31:06,286
Our responsibility is to the patient.

470
00:31:06,354 --> 00:31:10,290
Lf, medically,
he's at the top of the list,

471
00:31:10,358 --> 00:31:12,519
then he should get the heart.

472
00:31:14,062 --> 00:31:16,292
- Hypothetically.
- Thank you, sir.

473
00:31:16,364 --> 00:31:20,801
But practically? Whoever removed
the patient from the LVAD,

474
00:31:20,868 --> 00:31:23,166
I expect to be given names

475
00:31:23,237 --> 00:31:27,537
and there will be severe,
severe consequences.

476
00:31:29,911 --> 00:31:31,503
Yes, sir.

477
00:31:33,815 --> 00:31:37,148
Wait. Hold on. Dr. Hahn? Dr. Hahn!

478
00:31:37,218 --> 00:31:41,120
Can't stop now, Karev. I only have a few
hours to get this heart into my guy.

479
00:31:41,189 --> 00:31:43,020
Dr. Hahn.

480
00:31:48,896 --> 00:31:51,558
UNOS gave the heart to Seattle Grace.

481
00:31:51,632 --> 00:31:54,726
The transplant coordinator
stopped your guy from being prepped.

482
00:31:54,802 --> 00:31:56,531
Oh, come on!

483
00:31:57,572 --> 00:32:00,063
He has kids. They're four and five.

484
00:32:00,908 --> 00:32:03,570
Do you know how long
he's been waiting for this?

485
00:32:05,113 --> 00:32:08,674
He's a good person. He deserves a heart.

486
00:32:10,051 --> 00:32:13,145
- I'm sorry.
- I'll bet you are.

487
00:32:13,221 --> 00:32:15,781
No. I am. Believe me.

488
00:32:23,331 --> 00:32:27,028
Listen,
we have a chopper waiting on the roof.

489
00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:29,702
And?

490
00:32:37,211 --> 00:32:39,441
You could take up fishing.

491
00:32:39,514 --> 00:32:42,972
- I don't fish.
- Fishing's a lot more fun than surgery.

492
00:32:44,318 --> 00:32:46,786
I have 80 percent hand function now.

493
00:32:47,788 --> 00:32:52,054
Hmm. 80 percent's not enough.
Not for you.

494
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,367
- Fishing, huh?
- You don't fish.

495
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,730
Shepherd?

496
00:34:13,808 --> 00:34:17,904
You don't have to thank me. I'm
sure you'll return the favor one day.

497
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,644
I was going to say,
please try not to kill me.

498
00:34:21,716 --> 00:34:24,844
I'll do my best.

499
00:34:27,488 --> 00:34:28,648
OK.

500
00:34:49,477 --> 00:34:52,241
- Hmm.
- Look at that thing.

501
00:34:52,313 --> 00:34:54,338
Left ventricle's excessively dilated.

502
00:34:54,415 --> 00:34:57,077
He wouldn't have lasted another hour
with this heart.

503
00:34:57,151 --> 00:34:59,085
No, he wouldn't have.

504
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:04,024
OK, retract that little bit right there.

505
00:35:04,091 --> 00:35:08,494
OK, I am now removing the aneurysm
from the nerve cluster.

506
00:35:10,731 --> 00:35:12,562
NAPs are dropping.

507
00:35:13,534 --> 00:35:15,661
Arterial pressure's down 50 percent.

508
00:35:15,736 --> 00:35:17,203
Did you cut the nerve root?

509
00:35:17,271 --> 00:35:19,671
I don't see any discontinuity
of the nerves.

510
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,506
All right, let's do a reflex test
on his hand. Chief.

511
00:35:23,577 --> 00:35:25,044
OK.

512
00:35:26,147 --> 00:35:28,115
- Nothing.
- Damn it. Try it again.

513
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,281
Uh-uh.

514
00:35:31,352 --> 00:35:34,480
This doesn't make sense.
I'd know if I severed a nerve.

515
00:35:36,357 --> 00:35:38,848
Derek, is the arm paralyzed?

516
00:35:41,429 --> 00:35:43,590
- I have to do a wake-up test.
- Derek.

517
00:35:43,664 --> 00:35:46,098
There's only one person
who can help me figure out

518
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:49,227
whether or not I've damaged
the relay or not, and that's Burke.

519
00:35:49,303 --> 00:35:51,294
He's been through a lot of trauma today.

520
00:35:51,372 --> 00:35:53,897
I'm trying to prevent the trauma
he's going to feel

521
00:35:53,974 --> 00:35:55,771
if I have to tell him he's paralyzed.

522
00:36:00,815 --> 00:36:03,909
Bailey's treating us
like we're children. We're not children.

523
00:36:03,984 --> 00:36:06,714
We shouldn't have to sit out here
like we're on a time-out.

524
00:36:06,787 --> 00:36:10,450
It is a time-out. What we did
is way in need of a time-out.

525
00:36:11,058 --> 00:36:14,323
You realize we could get kicked out
of the program for this?

526
00:36:14,395 --> 00:36:16,295
Not we.

527
00:36:16,364 --> 00:36:18,355
I did this.

528
00:36:18,432 --> 00:36:20,559
I did this.

529
00:36:22,837 --> 00:36:25,829
You're probably right.
Maybe I should run.

530
00:36:27,074 --> 00:36:30,305
But I'd rather be running towards
somebody than running away.

531
00:36:31,379 --> 00:36:33,244
Yang? Shepherd's asking for you.

532
00:36:33,314 --> 00:36:35,339
Uh, for Burke's surgery?

533
00:36:35,416 --> 00:36:37,407
- Yes. Hurry up.
- Uh...

534
00:36:37,485 --> 00:36:40,352
I- I can't. I'm... I'm in a time-out.

535
00:36:40,421 --> 00:36:43,447
Time-out's over. Right now.
Yang, we need you.

536
00:36:47,495 --> 00:36:50,430
He said marry me, right? He did?

537
00:36:50,998 --> 00:36:53,865
- That really happened?
- It really happened.

538
00:36:53,934 --> 00:36:55,959
It really did.

539
00:37:00,207 --> 00:37:02,505
Screw this. I'm checking on Denny.

540
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:12,846
OK. How we doing?

541
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,050
He's at the edge of consciousness.
Very light. He should be up soon.

542
00:37:18,092 --> 00:37:20,424
OK. Yang? You're up.

543
00:37:21,662 --> 00:37:24,062
Oh... what? I'm sorry.
What do you need me to do?

544
00:37:24,131 --> 00:37:26,622
When he comes to,
he's going to be disoriented

545
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,669
and he'll probably fight the intubation.
We can't numb the arm

546
00:37:29,737 --> 00:37:32,831
because we need him to move his fingers.
He will be in a lot of pain.

547
00:37:32,907 --> 00:37:35,603
- We need you to keep him focused, OK?
- OK. Yeah.

548
00:37:35,676 --> 00:37:37,667
OK, let's, let's wake him up.

549
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:40,239
Burke?

550
00:37:42,983 --> 00:37:46,009
Thank you. For calling me about Izzie.

551
00:37:48,088 --> 00:37:50,352
L- I didn't do you any favors.

552
00:37:53,093 --> 00:37:56,756
Well, it meant something that you
called. It meant something to me.

553
00:37:56,831 --> 00:37:58,958
It didn't mean anything.

554
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:01,365
Right. OK. Sorry.

555
00:38:01,435 --> 00:38:03,562
Stop saying that you're sorry!

556
00:38:10,444 --> 00:38:12,674
You want to know something?

557
00:38:15,049 --> 00:38:16,846
I knew.

558
00:38:18,819 --> 00:38:21,549
I knew you didn't feel that way
about me.

559
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,124
Even during...

560
00:38:26,594 --> 00:38:29,358
When we were in bed, I knew.

561
00:38:29,864 --> 00:38:31,957
I knew and I still let it happen.

562
00:38:32,466 --> 00:38:34,696
Because, um...

563
00:38:35,503 --> 00:38:36,993
I...

564
00:38:37,805 --> 00:38:39,705
I figured that...

565
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:43,366
one night with you
was better than never.

566
00:38:50,584 --> 00:38:55,248
So you just stop saying
that you're sorry...

567
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,722
because you didn't know any better.

568
00:39:01,729 --> 00:39:03,720
But I did.

569
00:39:07,501 --> 00:39:08,991
And...

570
00:39:14,475 --> 00:39:16,136
I'm sorry.

571
00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:33,017
I'm sorry, Meredith.

572
00:39:41,502 --> 00:39:44,369
Burke, it's Cristina. I'm sorry.

573
00:39:47,741 --> 00:39:50,574
Wake up. Wake up.

574
00:39:50,644 --> 00:39:53,272
Wake up. Burke.

575
00:39:55,849 --> 00:39:58,750
Baby, wake up. Do it for me.
Open your eyes.

576
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,317
Hi. Hi.

577
00:40:01,388 --> 00:40:03,822
Get ready. Get ready.
Hold him down.

578
00:40:03,891 --> 00:40:06,257
- Calm him down.
- Yang!

579
00:40:07,094 --> 00:40:10,655
Cristina, get in there. Get in his face.
Talk to him, Cristina.

580
00:40:10,731 --> 00:40:12,460
- Yang!
- Get in there!

581
00:40:12,533 --> 00:40:15,832
Hold him down! Hold him down!
Calm him down! Cristina!

582
00:40:17,438 --> 00:40:18,769
Scissors.

583
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:20,739
It's beautiful work, Dr. Hahn.

584
00:40:20,808 --> 00:40:23,436
The hard part is still to come.

585
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:26,502
All right, let's start taking him
off bypass.

586
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:30,715
See if this heart will beat on its own.

587
00:40:32,987 --> 00:40:37,083
- Nothing.
- Come on, Denny. Beat for me.

588
00:40:39,693 --> 00:40:41,718
Cristina!

589
00:40:43,998 --> 00:40:45,693
Hold him down, Chief. Hold his arm.

590
00:40:45,766 --> 00:40:47,996
Preston? Preston, look at me!
Look at me!

591
00:40:48,068 --> 00:40:51,196
Right here. Listen, listen.
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

592
00:40:51,271 --> 00:40:54,365
Listen, there was a complication.
We can fix it.

593
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:56,875
We need you to move your fingers
on your right side.

594
00:40:56,944 --> 00:40:59,208
Can you do that?
Come on, you can do this.

595
00:40:59,279 --> 00:41:02,715
Look at me.
On your right hand. OK? I know. I know.

596
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:06,147
It's just you and me. We can do this.
OK. Come on. Focus. Focus.

597
00:41:07,521 --> 00:41:10,183
Now you're going to move your fingers on
your right hand.

598
00:41:10,257 --> 00:41:13,556
Come on, Preston. You can do it.
Move your fingers. Move your fingers.

599
00:41:13,627 --> 00:41:18,087
Come on. Come on.

600
00:41:18,165 --> 00:41:20,497
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

601
00:41:24,471 --> 00:41:27,702
- No response. Charge to 20.
- Clear.

602
00:41:27,775 --> 00:41:30,437
Come on. Come on.

603
00:41:32,946 --> 00:41:34,743
Come on.

604
00:41:51,198 --> 00:41:53,166
Come on.

605
00:42:12,953 --> 00:42:14,750
Come on, come on, come on.

606
00:42:15,622 --> 00:42:18,614
Come on. Come on.

607
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,352
Come on. Good.
You're doing good, Dr. Burke.

608
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:26,922
OK, I need you to touch each finger
of your right hand to your thumb.

609
00:42:27,267 --> 00:42:28,632
One.

610
00:42:30,537 --> 00:42:33,165
Two. You're doing great.
Keep going.

611
00:42:34,441 --> 00:42:36,341
- Three. Good.
- One more.

612
00:42:38,145 --> 00:42:39,442
That's good.

613
00:42:40,647 --> 00:42:43,081
- Dr. Hahn...
- Wait for it.

614
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,549
- Dr. Hahn? He...
- Just wait!

615
00:43:07,074 --> 00:43:10,066
And that's how we raise the dead
in Erica Land.

616
00:43:11,145 --> 00:43:13,136
Good job, Denny.

617
00:44:09,236 --> 00:44:10,931
Hey.

618
00:44:11,004 --> 00:44:13,837
- Camille's parents here?
- Yes.

619
00:44:14,608 --> 00:44:16,599
There aren't any options.

620
00:44:17,211 --> 00:44:19,679
I could do a hysterectomy,
an ovarectomy,

621
00:44:19,746 --> 00:44:21,680
pick out the remaining ovaries.

622
00:44:21,748 --> 00:44:24,012
We could try chemo, maybe radiation,

623
00:44:24,084 --> 00:44:27,781
but the cancer's spread to her liver,
her lungs, her bowel.

624
00:44:27,855 --> 00:44:29,789
- Even if we were aggressive...
- No.

625
00:44:33,327 --> 00:44:34,726
I hate this.

626
00:44:34,795 --> 00:44:36,592
I never get used to telling someone

627
00:44:36,663 --> 00:44:39,655
their kid's going to drop dead
before she's 18.

628
00:44:41,802 --> 00:44:43,770
Oh, dammit.

629
00:44:45,305 --> 00:44:47,068
I'm sorry. I didn't...

630
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:50,041
I'm not usually this insensitive,
Richard, I just...

631
00:44:50,844 --> 00:44:53,836
- It's just been one of those days.
- It's OK.

632
00:44:55,582 --> 00:44:58,210
I'm gonna go...
I mean, do you want to go?

633
00:44:58,285 --> 00:45:01,550
Oh, no, you go. They'd rather hear it
from the treating physician.

634
00:45:01,622 --> 00:45:05,820
I got work to get back to. Deal
with this Denny Duquette situation.

635
00:45:40,027 --> 00:45:42,222
I cut the LVAD wire.

636
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:45,260
Actually, I cut the LVAD wire.

637
00:45:45,332 --> 00:45:48,733
No. I did it.
I'm the one who cut the wire.

638
00:45:52,005 --> 00:45:54,132
Fine. I cut the LVAD wire.

639
00:45:55,242 --> 00:45:57,574
- I'm totally innocent.
- Alex!

640
00:45:57,644 --> 00:46:01,239
I wasn't here. He knows I wasn't here.
The guy's not mentally challenged.

641
00:46:01,315 --> 00:46:03,806
That's not the point.
What about loyalty?

642
00:46:03,884 --> 00:46:05,784
We made an agreement.

643
00:46:05,852 --> 00:46:10,255
People! I know who did this. So, you
might as well come clean. I know.

644
00:46:10,324 --> 00:46:13,691
With all due respect, sir, if you knew,
you wouldn't be asking us.

645
00:46:15,696 --> 00:46:19,530
- I did what...
- You have your suspicions,

646
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,726
- but you don't actually know.
- Not for sure.

647
00:46:21,802 --> 00:46:24,669
And you can't do anything to any of us
without proof, sir.

648
00:46:24,738 --> 00:46:27,366
Well, one of you
compromised a patient's life.

649
00:46:27,441 --> 00:46:29,534
One of you stole an organ.

650
00:46:29,609 --> 00:46:33,477
One of you jeopardized the integrity
of this hospital and of UNOS.

651
00:46:33,547 --> 00:46:36,641
Now, you tell me,
and you tell me right now!

652
00:46:42,956 --> 00:46:44,480
All right, fine.

653
00:46:51,365 --> 00:46:53,765
No surgeries.

654
00:46:53,834 --> 00:46:56,200
- Sir?
- You heard. No surgeries.

655
00:46:56,269 --> 00:46:58,294
No one scrubs in,
or watches from the gallery,

656
00:46:58,372 --> 00:47:00,863
no one so much as goes near
the OR floor.

657
00:47:00,941 --> 00:47:04,775
Until someone confesses, the five of you
will share a single patient:

658
00:47:04,845 --> 00:47:08,542
Camille Travis. Whatever she wants,
the five of you will provide it!

659
00:47:08,615 --> 00:47:10,515
Whatever she wants.

660
00:47:10,584 --> 00:47:12,711
Now, get the hell out of my sight!

661
00:47:14,054 --> 00:47:17,080
- He didn't say we were fired.
- He might as well have.

662
00:47:17,157 --> 00:47:20,126
- No surgeries?
- That wasn't bad. We got off easy.

663
00:47:20,193 --> 00:47:22,093
Yeah, for now. You think this is over?

664
00:47:22,162 --> 00:47:25,325
I could use a good coma
right now. A nice, long coma.

665
00:47:25,399 --> 00:47:29,233
There's only been three careers I've
ever wanted. Ruler of my own planet,

666
00:47:29,302 --> 00:47:31,133
Wonder Woman, or a surgeon.

667
00:47:31,204 --> 00:47:34,571
I don't see any invisible planes
or extra countries lying around.

668
00:47:34,641 --> 00:47:37,576
I will go back and tell him.
I will tell him it was me.

669
00:47:37,644 --> 00:47:41,705
And get kicked out of the program?
You will keep your mouth shut.

670
00:47:41,782 --> 00:47:44,512
We all will keep our mouths shut.

671
00:47:45,052 --> 00:47:47,418
- This is crap. I'm turning her in.
- Alex.

672
00:47:47,487 --> 00:47:49,682
What? You said we had to stand by Izzie.

673
00:47:49,756 --> 00:47:53,453
Now I get stuck catering some V.I.P.
Chick patient? I don't think so.

674
00:47:53,527 --> 00:47:57,520
Alex, I am sorry and I really do
appreciate what you did for Denny.

675
00:47:57,597 --> 00:48:01,363
Shut up. I only lied to Burke because
I wanted in on that transplant surgery.

676
00:48:01,435 --> 00:48:04,563
I don't care about Denny and I hope
you get thrown out on your ass.

677
00:48:04,638 --> 00:48:07,698
Hey! We stick together. We all did this.
Nobody's a victim.

678
00:48:07,774 --> 00:48:09,469
We... we stick together.

679
00:48:10,844 --> 00:48:12,243
- Damn it.
- Thank you.

680
00:48:12,312 --> 00:48:14,177
- You're welcome.
- We can handle this.

681
00:48:14,247 --> 00:48:17,614
Camille Travis is a kid with cancer.
We give her what she wants for a while.

682
00:48:17,684 --> 00:48:19,879
- How hard can that be?
- Harder than you think.

683
00:48:21,021 --> 00:48:24,752
This is Claire and Natalie.
Camille Travis' friends.

684
00:48:24,825 --> 00:48:27,350
Her very best friends
in the whole wide world.

685
00:48:27,427 --> 00:48:30,157
Girls, who exactly is Camille Travis?

686
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:31,959
Like, the Chief of Surgery's niece.

687
00:48:32,032 --> 00:48:35,798
And girls, what does the Chief
of Surgery's niece want, exactly?

688
00:48:35,869 --> 00:48:39,896
- Like, a prom.
- No. Like, the best prom ever.

689
00:48:40,173 --> 00:48:43,074
- We need a theme.
- Theme...

690
00:48:43,143 --> 00:48:46,943
Ooh! Ooh! Can we have sparkly lights?
Because sparkly lights are amazing!

691
00:48:47,881 --> 00:48:50,645
I didn't like teenage girls
when I was a teenage girl.

692
00:48:52,219 --> 00:48:54,346
- I wore a lot of black.
- Oh!

693
00:48:54,421 --> 00:48:55,513
Hmm.

694
00:48:55,589 --> 00:48:58,422
I had the whole angry,
pink-hair thing going on.

695
00:48:58,492 --> 00:49:00,517
I wouldn't have been
caught dead at a prom.

696
00:49:00,594 --> 00:49:02,585
Oh, my mother made me go.

697
00:49:02,662 --> 00:49:06,257
My date barfed on my dress
and then tried to feel me up.

698
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:08,392
Mm-hm.

699
00:49:08,468 --> 00:49:11,869
There's a lot to be said
for being an adult.

700
00:49:11,938 --> 00:49:13,200
Yeah.

701
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:17,438
You haven't mentioned Burke.

702
00:49:18,612 --> 00:49:19,874
No.

703
00:49:20,847 --> 00:49:23,873
- Well, have you checked on him?
- No.

704
00:49:27,888 --> 00:49:31,881
OK, I could try harder to make you
open up and deal with the Burke thing,

705
00:49:31,958 --> 00:49:34,950
or I could be neurotic and selfish
and talk about my problems.

706
00:49:35,028 --> 00:49:37,553
Which would be
more supportive right now?

707
00:49:37,631 --> 00:49:39,622
Selfish and neurotic, please.

708
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,389
Hm.

709
00:49:41,902 --> 00:49:44,632
Finn says Doc's in pain.

710
00:49:44,704 --> 00:49:48,765
Derek and I have to talk about whether
we should put him to sleep or not.

711
00:49:48,842 --> 00:49:52,744
Finn thinks there's something going on
with me and Derek. Which there is not.

712
00:49:52,812 --> 00:49:54,507
There so clearly is not.

713
00:49:55,615 --> 00:49:58,140
- And Addison having that meltdown?
- Ugh.

714
00:49:58,218 --> 00:50:01,244
I mean, dogs get sick and we're expected
to put them to sleep.

715
00:50:01,321 --> 00:50:04,119
People get sick, we don't put them down.

716
00:50:04,191 --> 00:50:06,557
We don't just give up on people.

717
00:50:07,694 --> 00:50:10,959
There's nothing going on
between me and Derek.

718
00:50:14,134 --> 00:50:16,602
There is a lot to be said
for being an adult.

719
00:50:21,508 --> 00:50:22,702
Yeah.

720
00:50:32,586 --> 00:50:35,487
- Bailey around?
- No, she was in here earlier.

721
00:50:36,389 --> 00:50:39,256
Said she'd be back in a couple
of hours. The coast is clear.

722
00:50:42,829 --> 00:50:45,730
You look... God, you look amazing.

723
00:50:45,799 --> 00:50:48,893
They always tell you
that transplant patients rebound fast,

724
00:50:48,969 --> 00:50:50,960
but, you know, to see it in person...

725
00:50:51,037 --> 00:50:55,906
I have warm hands. I've never had warm
hands because of my circulation.

726
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:58,939
Feel.

727
00:50:59,012 --> 00:51:03,244
Warm hands and check it out,
I have a regular heartbeat.

728
00:51:03,316 --> 00:51:06,149
Yes, you do.

729
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:12,015
I should, um... I got to go.

730
00:51:12,092 --> 00:51:14,788
I would stay,
but if Bailey catches me here, she'd...

731
00:51:14,861 --> 00:51:18,592
And, uh, you know, the Chief has us
doing this prom thing. It's so...

732
00:51:18,665 --> 00:51:21,395
But, yeah, I'm really happy for you.

733
00:51:21,468 --> 00:51:24,801
You look... Whoo-hoo, Denny.

734
00:51:24,871 --> 00:51:26,930
- OK. I'm going to go.
- What?

735
00:51:27,007 --> 00:51:28,338
Huh?

736
00:51:28,408 --> 00:51:31,536
You like your men sick and feeble?
You don't dig healthy guys?

737
00:51:31,611 --> 00:51:34,910
I... I dig you.

738
00:51:34,981 --> 00:51:37,279
Then why are you all swirly and twitchy?

739
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:40,513
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you're swirly and twitchy.

740
00:51:42,022 --> 00:51:44,582
It's because I asked you to marry me.

741
00:51:44,658 --> 00:51:48,185
- So you remember that?
- It's not the kind of thing I'd forget.

742
00:51:48,261 --> 00:51:53,324
Yeah. Look, Denny, um...
I'm giving you an out.

743
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,561
Excuse me?
Well, I'm giving you an out.

744
00:51:55,635 --> 00:51:58,695
I mean, you thought you were dying,
and I was saving your life,

745
00:51:58,772 --> 00:52:01,070
and you know, everything was so...

746
00:52:02,676 --> 00:52:06,339
So I won't hold it against you, or...

747
00:52:06,413 --> 00:52:09,849
be hurt and offended if you wanna take
your proposal back.

748
00:52:11,117 --> 00:52:13,051
I'm giving you an out.

749
00:52:14,554 --> 00:52:16,545
I don't want an out.

750
00:52:18,258 --> 00:52:20,590
You should take the out.

751
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:25,529
We can't get married.
I mean, that would be crazy. Insane.

752
00:52:25,598 --> 00:52:28,465
We should date and have sex.
Plenty of sex.

753
00:52:28,535 --> 00:52:32,369
When your heart gets better,
all the sex you can handle.

754
00:52:32,806 --> 00:52:33,966
But marriage is, um...

755
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:38,409
- Marriage. I mean...
- OK. It's my turn now.

756
00:52:38,478 --> 00:52:40,878
- But I need to...
- No, no, no. We're taking turns.

757
00:52:40,947 --> 00:52:43,814
I've decided it's polite
and it keeps me from yelling.

758
00:52:43,883 --> 00:52:46,977
When it's your turn again, you can talk.

759
00:52:49,356 --> 00:52:54,020
For five years, I've had to live
by the choices of my doctors.

760
00:52:55,495 --> 00:52:58,020
The guys that cut me open...

761
00:52:58,098 --> 00:53:01,932
decided my life.
There wasn't one choice that was mine.

762
00:53:02,602 --> 00:53:09,474
And now I have this heart
that beats and works.

763
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:13,171
I get to be like everybody else.

764
00:53:13,847 --> 00:53:18,181
I get to make my own decisions,
have my own life,

765
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:22,087
do whatever the damn hell I choose.

766
00:53:24,324 --> 00:53:28,055
Now, here's the good part.
So you listen close.

767
00:53:29,996 --> 00:53:32,464
What I choose...

768
00:53:32,532 --> 00:53:34,523
is you.

769
00:53:35,869 --> 00:53:40,772
You're who I want to wake up with
and go to bed with

770
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,741
and do everything in between with.

771
00:53:46,346 --> 00:53:48,507
I get a choice now.

772
00:53:50,784 --> 00:53:52,775
I get to choose.

773
00:53:55,422 --> 00:53:57,652
I choose you, Izzie Stevens.

774
00:54:02,262 --> 00:54:05,425
OK. It's your turn again.

775
00:54:23,316 --> 00:54:24,282
They're not talking.

776
00:54:24,317 --> 00:54:26,308
Wagons have been circled.

777
00:54:26,386 --> 00:54:29,617
I need answers.
Somebody's got to take responsibility.

778
00:54:29,689 --> 00:54:32,749
I can tell you what I think happened,
what I assumed happened.

779
00:54:32,826 --> 00:54:34,726
But they're the only ones that know it.

780
00:54:34,794 --> 00:54:38,286
I want to meet with each of them
separately. I will break them.

781
00:54:41,134 --> 00:54:43,864
- You have a dress for the prom?
- Excuse me?

782
00:54:44,537 --> 00:54:48,530
I'm going to the prom. If I have to go,
everybody has to go.

783
00:54:48,608 --> 00:54:50,940
What? I'm a grown woman.

784
00:54:52,212 --> 00:54:55,648
Everybody goes to the prom! Everybody!

785
00:55:00,453 --> 00:55:02,080
Central High? Two years ago,

786
00:55:02,155 --> 00:55:04,749
they went with all black
and had purple lights and...

787
00:55:04,824 --> 00:55:06,883
Everybody looked like ghouls.

788
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,360
Fine, we could go with all white!

789
00:55:09,429 --> 00:55:12,990
<i>I was reading Elle Girl and they...</i>

790
00:55:14,934 --> 00:55:18,392
- Are you having a seizure?
- Will that get me out of here?

791
00:55:18,471 --> 00:55:20,962
Fine, let's go with seizure.

792
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,770
Seizure beats the hell
out of a 45-minute conversation

793
00:55:23,843 --> 00:55:26,004
about what color balloons
we're gonna buy.

794
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:28,809
- You need to get a life!
- Chief's niece. Chief's niece.

795
00:55:28,882 --> 00:55:32,750
It's OK. The hot ones are always mean.
It's like a rule or something.

796
00:55:32,819 --> 00:55:35,379
- Doesn't he remind you of Nate Sims?
- Totally.

797
00:55:35,455 --> 00:55:38,390
- He's totally Nate.
- No, I'm not Nate.

798
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:40,551
- Don't engage.
- Nate broke up with Camille

799
00:55:40,627 --> 00:55:42,595
the first time she had cancer.

800
00:55:42,662 --> 00:55:45,597
The other thing about the hot ones:
They're usually cowards.

801
00:55:45,665 --> 00:55:48,600
Don't you dare try to judge us
for trying to make our friend,

802
00:55:48,668 --> 00:55:51,330
who just happens to be dying of cancer,
happy.

803
00:55:51,404 --> 00:55:54,373
The color does matter. Maybe not to you.

804
00:55:55,108 --> 00:55:56,405
But it does matter.

805
00:55:58,478 --> 00:55:59,945
Not to bother you, but...

806
00:56:01,147 --> 00:56:04,674
What? One of you better spit out
the problem right now!

807
00:56:04,751 --> 00:56:08,847
The problem is the colors and
the balloons and the "Under the Sea. "

808
00:56:08,922 --> 00:56:12,358
<i>"No, it's Titanic. " "Let's go with
Tears in Heaven. " "No, too morbid. "</i>

809
00:56:12,425 --> 00:56:15,485
"It should be pink. " "It should be red. "
"It should be a rainbow!"

810
00:56:15,562 --> 00:56:18,929
He's saying we're very hopeful
that you speak teenage girl.

811
00:56:18,998 --> 00:56:21,193
Silver and white.
It's mystical and magical.

812
00:56:21,267 --> 00:56:24,759
Ever see fashion week in New York?
Silver and white runways and backdrops.

813
00:56:24,837 --> 00:56:27,101
No matter what color the clothes are,
they pop.

814
00:56:27,173 --> 00:56:28,401
- They pop?
- They pop.

815
00:56:28,474 --> 00:56:29,805
- Sounds good.
- Yeah.

816
00:56:29,876 --> 00:56:33,539
O'Malley and Karev, get 500 balloons
in silver and white and 100 in black.

817
00:56:33,613 --> 00:56:34,978
Shiny black, not the matte.

818
00:56:35,048 --> 00:56:37,915
Yang, stick with Camille,
keep her spirits up.

819
00:56:37,984 --> 00:56:40,748
Make sure she has her shoes, dress
and makeup on standby.

820
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:43,186
Grey, get with Patricia.
Make sure we can rope off

821
00:56:43,256 --> 00:56:46,419
the second-floor nurses' station
and waiting area. And get menus.

822
00:56:46,492 --> 00:56:48,084
Got it?

823
00:56:49,128 --> 00:56:51,562
Oh, no, no.
You don't get to look at me like that.

824
00:56:51,631 --> 00:56:55,067
No, you compromised my medical license.
You nearly killed a patient,

825
00:56:55,134 --> 00:56:58,069
lied to the Chief of Surgery,
and made me look bad.

826
00:56:58,137 --> 00:57:00,332
We are doing this prom
and doing it right. Move!

827
00:57:01,941 --> 00:57:07,277
There's an emergency appendectomy
happening in OR 1 as we speak.

828
00:57:07,347 --> 00:57:08,814
Again, I'm sorry.

829
00:57:08,881 --> 00:57:11,042
Stop saying you're sorry
when you're not.

830
00:57:11,117 --> 00:57:13,176
You make me sick.

831
00:57:14,721 --> 00:57:16,416
- Nice.
- Hey.

832
00:57:16,489 --> 00:57:18,923
Hey.

833
00:57:18,992 --> 00:57:20,983
- Can we talk?
- Yeah.

834
00:57:21,995 --> 00:57:23,462
Hold it.

835
00:57:24,731 --> 00:57:26,460
- Hey.
- You never called.

836
00:57:26,532 --> 00:57:28,466
- What?
- Last night.

837
00:57:28,534 --> 00:57:31,230
We had plans and you went off with Izzie
and never called.

838
00:57:31,304 --> 00:57:34,364
- A lot of stuff went down last night.
- I know, everybody heard.

839
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,034
- So what exactly happened?
- I can't talk about it.

840
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:39,476
Come on. I'm not going to tell, George.
It's me.

841
00:57:39,545 --> 00:57:43,208
Look, it's Vegas. What happened
in that room stays in that room.

842
00:57:43,282 --> 00:57:45,614
- OK. Yeah, I get it.
- Hey.

843
00:57:49,422 --> 00:57:51,413
Do you want to go to prom with me?

844
00:57:52,592 --> 00:57:56,153
No, George. No, I don't want to go
to prom with you.

845
00:57:59,966 --> 00:58:01,763
What was that about?

846
00:58:03,403 --> 00:58:05,769
- She said she loved me.
- Oh.

847
00:58:07,974 --> 00:58:09,373
Oh.

848
00:58:09,442 --> 00:58:11,273
Oh! Hey.

849
00:58:11,344 --> 00:58:14,074
- I've been calling your cell all night.
- Um... oh, well,

850
00:58:14,147 --> 00:58:16,843
uh, it's a long story,

851
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:19,714
which essentially ends with me
inviting you to a prom.

852
00:58:19,786 --> 00:58:23,916
An actual prom?
A... corsages and tuxedos?

853
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:26,151
Yeah, I know it's stupid, but...

854
00:58:26,225 --> 00:58:27,954
No. I'm in. I loved prom.

855
00:58:28,027 --> 00:58:31,258
I mean, I don't want to brag
or anything, but I was crowned king.

856
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:34,891
Really?
You were that kid in high school?

857
00:58:34,967 --> 00:58:38,926
- What is wrong with being that kid?
- Nothing. It's very cute, actually.

858
00:58:39,005 --> 00:58:41,337
- Hello.
- Hi.

859
00:58:42,575 --> 00:58:44,634
What are you doing here?

860
00:58:44,711 --> 00:58:48,442
Doc had some seizures last night.

861
00:58:48,514 --> 00:58:53,144
Pretty serious. The cancer
spread to his brain. I'm sorry.

862
00:58:56,723 --> 00:58:58,213
- Hey.
- Hey.

863
00:58:58,291 --> 00:59:00,259
How's Preston?

864
00:59:00,326 --> 00:59:02,794
He's recovering nicely.

865
00:59:03,596 --> 00:59:06,030
- Addison...
- I don't want to talk about it.

866
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:10,365
I mean we've come so far. You forgave me
for Mark and we're trying.

867
00:59:10,436 --> 00:59:11,733
- We are.
- We are trying.

868
00:59:11,804 --> 00:59:12,930
We're trying.

869
00:59:13,005 --> 00:59:15,906
And I was jealous
when there was no need to be.

870
00:59:16,576 --> 00:59:18,100
Right?

871
00:59:19,879 --> 00:59:21,540
Addison?

872
00:59:23,349 --> 00:59:25,817
- What?
- Will you go to the prom with me?

873
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:13,721
I went to college
on a wrestling scholarship.

874
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:17,164
I played baseball, some basketball.
But we'll go with football.

875
01:00:17,236 --> 01:00:19,898
What does football have to do
with who cut the LVAD wires?

876
01:00:19,972 --> 01:00:23,237
Let's say you were drafted to a team
that wasn't your first pick.

877
01:00:23,309 --> 01:00:27,143
You know, you don't like the players.
You hate the way they play the game.

878
01:00:27,213 --> 01:00:29,681
You even think the quarterback
is full of crap.

879
01:00:29,749 --> 01:00:33,617
Now the quarterback's a pain in the ass
that you don't owe a damn thing to,

880
01:00:33,686 --> 01:00:37,952
but... it's your team. You don't quit.

881
01:00:38,991 --> 01:00:42,654
You don't talk to the press.
You don't bitch to the coach.

882
01:00:42,728 --> 01:00:46,129
You just... you just go out there
every Sunday

883
01:00:46,199 --> 01:00:50,226
and you make the blocks and you take
the hits and you play to win.

884
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:55,930
You show up and you suit up and you
play. Because it's your freaking team.

885
01:00:57,877 --> 01:00:59,811
I know your type.

886
01:01:01,914 --> 01:01:03,973
You're a surgical junkie.

887
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:05,745
Yes, sir?

888
01:01:05,818 --> 01:01:10,050
It's not going to be easy for you
to be away from the OR that long.

889
01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:12,821
No, sir.

890
01:01:12,892 --> 01:01:15,087
And if you want to get back to the OR,

891
01:01:15,161 --> 01:01:18,062
you're going to tell me
what I need to know, aren't you?

892
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:20,121
You're right.

893
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,960
It's not easy for me
to be away from the OR.

894
01:01:24,036 --> 01:01:26,368
It's not easy for me
to sit in front of you

895
01:01:26,439 --> 01:01:28,737
or any other authority figure
for that matter,

896
01:01:28,808 --> 01:01:32,141
and not be able to give you
the exact answer you want to hear.

897
01:01:32,211 --> 01:01:35,044
I've always been the one
with the answers.

898
01:01:35,114 --> 01:01:37,810
But right now, sir, I don't have any.

899
01:01:38,784 --> 01:01:41,617
- Dr. Yang...
- How do you keep your edge, sir?

900
01:01:42,054 --> 01:01:44,522
I watch you,
and you've been doing this a long time,

901
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:46,615
and you're clean. You're focused.

902
01:01:46,692 --> 01:01:48,853
You are the job. Nothing gets to you.

903
01:01:48,928 --> 01:01:52,364
And the thing is, sir, I was like that.
Until I got here.

904
01:01:53,466 --> 01:01:56,594
Until I actually started doing this job
and now everything is...

905
01:01:59,305 --> 01:02:01,705
- is fuzzy.
- That's besides the point.

906
01:02:01,774 --> 01:02:04,538
No, see, sir, this is the point.
Because I can't tell you.

907
01:02:05,678 --> 01:02:08,875
What happened in that room...
I can't tell you.

908
01:02:08,948 --> 01:02:13,009
And before, I could have.
No guilt, no loyalties, no problem.

909
01:02:14,787 --> 01:02:19,019
Before... before I wouldn't
have even been in that room.

910
01:02:20,126 --> 01:02:24,187
I wouldn't have gotten involved.
I would have never frozen in surgery.

911
01:02:25,998 --> 01:02:28,523
And I would have told him
what I thought he should do.

912
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:33,536
I had an edge, sir.

913
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:37,104
I had an edge and I've lost it.

914
01:02:37,877 --> 01:02:41,369
And I need it. I need it back.

915
01:02:41,447 --> 01:02:46,646
So if you could just tell me
how you keep yours

916
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:50,084
and how not to be affected,

917
01:02:50,957 --> 01:02:53,118
I know I could be a great surgeon.

918
01:02:53,793 --> 01:02:58,196
So, if you could just give me the
answers, I would really appreciate it.

919
01:03:06,272 --> 01:03:08,263
You're excused, Dr. Yang.

920
01:03:09,709 --> 01:03:11,700
- But...
- You're excused.

921
01:03:16,015 --> 01:03:19,246
I'll tell you. I'll tell you who cut the
LVAD wires, sir, if you...

922
01:03:19,318 --> 01:03:22,310
No, you won't. I don't want to know.
Not from you.

923
01:03:25,124 --> 01:03:28,855
Yeah, I have the answers,
but I can't tell them to you.

924
01:03:30,429 --> 01:03:33,762
I'm not going to be responsible
for you becoming less human.

925
01:03:39,739 --> 01:03:41,570
I'm a pretty girl.

926
01:03:42,274 --> 01:03:44,902
- What?
- I'm not being arrogant. It's just...

927
01:03:46,045 --> 01:03:51,073
Just a fact. For a long time, I made
a career from my looks, so I get it.

928
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:54,517
I'm a pretty girl.
And not in a "from-a-certain-angle" way.

929
01:03:54,587 --> 01:03:58,421
In an obvious way. It's the
blonde thing. And the big boobs thing.

930
01:03:58,491 --> 01:04:00,823
Big boobs are key to "obvious" pretty.

931
01:04:00,893 --> 01:04:03,418
- Dr. Stevens...
- It's how men see me.

932
01:04:03,496 --> 01:04:06,761
I'm not a smart girl or an interesting
girl. I'm a pretty girl.

933
01:04:07,666 --> 01:04:11,261
The blonde and the boobs confuse guys
into thinking that I'm someone else.

934
01:04:12,171 --> 01:04:16,870
And I'm used to it. I'm used to them
walking away when they realize...

935
01:04:18,244 --> 01:04:21,077
But then Denny goes
and asks me to marry him.

936
01:04:21,947 --> 01:04:23,608
Is that why you cut the wires?

937
01:04:23,682 --> 01:04:26,344
He doesn't make me feel
like I'm a pretty girl.

938
01:04:28,387 --> 01:04:30,617
He makes me feel like...

939
01:04:31,757 --> 01:04:34,521
like me.
I think he might know me.

940
01:04:35,361 --> 01:04:38,956
And so, if I did cut the LVAD wire,
and I'm not saying that I did,

941
01:04:39,031 --> 01:04:41,226
but if I did...

942
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:44,758
then no. I don't feel guilty.

943
01:04:45,604 --> 01:04:49,734
And I know that I should.
And I would if it were anybody else.

944
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,344
But I can't feel anything but happy.

945
01:05:10,796 --> 01:05:13,060
Are you gonna...

946
01:05:14,133 --> 01:05:15,896
say anything or?

947
01:05:20,139 --> 01:05:22,130
I'm not going to break.

948
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,513
I'm starting to get a little
freaked out, but I won't break.

949
01:05:34,753 --> 01:05:37,813
It's not because I don't care.
I do care what you think about me.

950
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:41,291
I do... care.

951
01:05:43,028 --> 01:05:45,394
I just can't tell you
what you want to hear.

952
01:05:50,136 --> 01:05:52,900
Which seems to be a theme in my life
right now.

953
01:05:55,341 --> 01:05:58,970
Just 'cause you can't say something
doesn't mean you don't want to.

954
01:05:59,645 --> 01:06:03,206
You can be with a person and be happy
with them, and not love them.

955
01:06:03,282 --> 01:06:05,944
And you can love someone
and not want to be with them.

956
01:06:06,018 --> 01:06:11,354
You don't need to... love someone...
to want them.

957
01:06:13,092 --> 01:06:14,923
But it's frustrating.

958
01:06:14,994 --> 01:06:19,488
When your brain says what you want and
what you actually want don't match up,

959
01:06:19,565 --> 01:06:21,328
it's exhausting.

960
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,630
And... well, it's complicated.

961
01:06:25,237 --> 01:06:26,966
But that's life.

962
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:29,030
And life...

963
01:06:33,812 --> 01:06:35,336
sucks.

964
01:06:36,148 --> 01:06:39,743
I've known you for a long time.
I know your mother and father.

965
01:06:40,686 --> 01:06:46,181
And I know, beyond a shadow of a doubt,
that you did not cut those LVAD wires.

966
01:06:47,059 --> 01:06:50,654
Meredith,
I need you to tell me who did it.

967
01:06:53,799 --> 01:06:57,860
I've been going over and over this in
my mind trying to piece this together.

968
01:07:00,005 --> 01:07:03,566
It was you. You were the reason
my parents broke up.

969
01:07:05,277 --> 01:07:08,974
And it wasn't just an affair.
She really loved you.

970
01:07:09,715 --> 01:07:13,242
It wasn't just this cheap thing where
she didn't tell you she was married.

971
01:07:13,886 --> 01:07:18,914
It wasn't all a lie.
She left her husband for you.

972
01:07:21,393 --> 01:07:25,887
But you stayed with your wife
because it was the right thing to do.

973
01:07:25,965 --> 01:07:30,595
Maybe safe, but she was the right person
for you to be with.

974
01:07:31,604 --> 01:07:34,038
And let's face it, my mother?

975
01:07:35,307 --> 01:07:37,138
Nothing wrong with being safe.

976
01:07:37,209 --> 01:07:40,303
Being with the good guy
because he's good.

977
01:07:40,379 --> 01:07:42,973
And we are talking about forever here.

978
01:07:43,048 --> 01:07:45,642
You've never regretted your decision.

979
01:07:45,718 --> 01:07:48,050
You've never looked back.

980
01:07:49,388 --> 01:07:50,855
Right?

981
01:08:03,836 --> 01:08:07,738
Finn says we need to make
a decision about Doc.

982
01:08:07,806 --> 01:08:08,886
- Good for Finn.
- Can we just do this?

983
01:08:09,308 --> 01:08:09,967
- Good for Finn.
- Can we just do this?

984
01:08:10,042 --> 01:08:13,011
- Fine.
- We may have to put him to sleep.

985
01:08:14,546 --> 01:08:15,535
Whatever.

986
01:08:15,681 --> 01:08:18,616
Can we do this one thing together
without arguing?

987
01:08:18,684 --> 01:08:20,584
What if he can get better?

988
01:08:20,653 --> 01:08:23,213
He's not going to get better.
You know that.

989
01:08:25,758 --> 01:08:29,489
Well, Finn thinks we should do it today,
then. So I guess I'll go over there.

990
01:08:29,561 --> 01:08:31,995
- Be there.
- What time?

991
01:08:33,699 --> 01:08:35,997
Are you coming?

992
01:08:36,068 --> 01:08:37,899
He's my dog.

993
01:08:38,737 --> 01:08:41,103
- Denny!
- What did I tell you?

994
01:08:41,173 --> 01:08:44,472
Visiting hours aren't for another hour.
You are no longer his doctor.

995
01:08:44,543 --> 01:08:46,306
Come back when the visitors come.

996
01:08:46,378 --> 01:08:49,438
- I would, but I can't wait.
- Lxnay on the insubordinationay.

997
01:08:49,515 --> 01:08:52,211
- But it's my turn.
- If the Chief finds out you were...

998
01:08:52,284 --> 01:08:54,650
Hold on. It's her turn.

999
01:09:01,126 --> 01:09:03,788
Yes. My answer is yes.

1000
01:09:03,862 --> 01:09:08,458
Oh, now see, you're going to make my
heart stop beating and it's brand new.

1001
01:09:10,035 --> 01:09:12,333
I will call security on you.

1002
01:09:13,339 --> 01:09:15,705
OK. I will come back
during visiting hours.

1003
01:09:15,774 --> 01:09:18,038
And it's prom,
so I'll show you my dress.

1004
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:19,372
OK.

1005
01:09:19,445 --> 01:09:21,345
I'm going.

1006
01:09:21,413 --> 01:09:23,244
Izzie.

1007
01:09:23,315 --> 01:09:25,613
You did good.

1008
01:09:30,956 --> 01:09:34,255
I tricked her into marrying me.
How smart am I?

1009
01:09:39,698 --> 01:09:42,690
We're throwing a prom.
Chief's making us throw a prom.

1010
01:09:44,436 --> 01:09:46,097
O'Malley mentioned.

1011
01:09:46,171 --> 01:09:49,834
- George came to see you?
- He's my friend.

1012
01:09:52,244 --> 01:09:53,768
Oh.

1013
01:09:55,214 --> 01:09:57,205
I won't bear a grudge.

1014
01:09:58,984 --> 01:10:00,576
What did you?

1015
01:10:03,355 --> 01:10:07,291
I have to take care of me.
I don't expect you to take care of me.

1016
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:09,259
But I have to take care of me.

1017
01:10:10,028 --> 01:10:11,689
If this...

1018
01:10:13,432 --> 01:10:15,798
If you can't stay here for this...

1019
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:19,833
I won't bear a grudge.

1020
01:10:22,107 --> 01:10:24,507
Are you going to tell Shepherd about...

1021
01:10:25,944 --> 01:10:28,037
Not yet.

1022
01:10:31,717 --> 01:10:33,275
I'm, uh...

1023
01:10:37,856 --> 01:10:39,847
Not yet.

1024
01:10:51,203 --> 01:10:53,671
OK. There's a couple of forms
you need to sign.

1025
01:10:53,739 --> 01:10:55,434
I only need one signature.

1026
01:10:56,341 --> 01:10:59,367
- You?
- It's fine. Here, I'll sign.

1027
01:10:59,978 --> 01:11:01,707
So, how do we do this?

1028
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:04,613
I'll give Doc an injection of terazole
to make him sleepy,

1029
01:11:04,683 --> 01:11:07,243
then I'll give him an IV injection
of phenobarbitol.

1030
01:11:07,319 --> 01:11:09,378
- And that will stop his heart?
- Yes.

1031
01:11:11,924 --> 01:11:14,415
And what do we do after? With his body?

1032
01:11:14,493 --> 01:11:18,953
We can... We have the means
to dispose of it for you.

1033
01:11:19,031 --> 01:11:20,521
That's fine. Go ahead.

1034
01:11:20,599 --> 01:11:22,760
We can't throw him away
like he's garbage.

1035
01:11:22,835 --> 01:11:25,030
- We would never...
- He's our dog, Derek.

1036
01:11:26,839 --> 01:11:29,273
There's that, uh, clearing
by the trailer.

1037
01:11:30,175 --> 01:11:32,075
Overlooking the water?

1038
01:11:32,377 --> 01:11:34,345
We can, uh, bury him there.

1039
01:11:34,413 --> 01:11:36,745
That sounds nice.

1040
01:11:39,551 --> 01:11:41,712
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1041
01:11:46,592 --> 01:11:48,685
I'm so sorry, Doc.

1042
01:11:49,528 --> 01:11:51,587
I'm sorry too.

1043
01:11:52,998 --> 01:11:55,489
- It's the hospital. I got to go.
- OK.

1044
01:11:56,568 --> 01:11:58,058
OK.

1045
01:11:58,136 --> 01:12:00,468
OK. I'll begin.

1046
01:12:01,974 --> 01:12:03,566
Shh, shh.

1047
01:12:08,614 --> 01:12:11,082
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

1048
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:16,449
It's OK.

1049
01:12:47,286 --> 01:12:49,277
He's gone.

1050
01:12:51,423 --> 01:12:53,891
- Meredith?
- I have to go home and change.

1051
01:12:53,959 --> 01:12:56,291
- I'll see you later, OK?
- Meredith.

1052
01:12:59,498 --> 01:13:01,898
I'm sorry. For your loss.

1053
01:13:01,967 --> 01:13:03,457
Yeah.

1054
01:13:03,535 --> 01:13:07,596
You know, the thing is he wasn't
really my dog for that long.

1055
01:13:07,673 --> 01:13:09,971
He was more Derek's dog.

1056
01:13:10,809 --> 01:13:12,436
Meredith.

1057
01:13:13,946 --> 01:13:16,676
- He was a good dog.
- He was.

1058
01:13:29,728 --> 01:13:31,889
Oh, I'm too tired for this.

1059
01:13:31,964 --> 01:13:33,611
Where's your husband, Dr. Bailey?

1060
01:13:33,646 --> 01:13:35,258
Uh, at home with the baby.

1061
01:13:35,834 --> 01:13:38,564
Thought you would
at least get to get out of this.

1062
01:13:38,637 --> 01:13:42,232
- Why?
- Well, with Burke upstairs.

1063
01:13:42,808 --> 01:13:46,209
What happened to him, I'm sure
the Chief would have let you out.

1064
01:13:46,278 --> 01:13:47,472
Yeah.

1065
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:50,075
Oh, God.

1066
01:13:53,285 --> 01:13:55,344
- Hey.
- Hey.

1067
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:57,251
You seen Meredith?

1068
01:13:57,322 --> 01:13:59,256
I don't think she's here yet.

1069
01:14:16,375 --> 01:14:19,606
This whole thing brings back very
traumatic memories

1070
01:14:19,678 --> 01:14:22,875
of being a band geek with braces
and the lisp.

1071
01:14:22,948 --> 01:14:28,284
<i>Spending the whole evening with
Skippy Gold talking about Star Wars.</i>

1072
01:14:29,087 --> 01:14:32,056
<i>- I hated Star Wars.
- Hmm. Thank God.</i>

1073
01:14:32,124 --> 01:14:34,058
- This is terrible.
- It's bad.

1074
01:14:34,126 --> 01:14:36,890
So, you want to, um, dance?

1075
01:14:38,063 --> 01:14:39,655
Love to.

1076
01:14:54,012 --> 01:14:56,003
Can I cut in?

1077
01:14:59,551 --> 01:15:03,647
What did you say to my boyfriend
to make him that scared of you?

1078
01:15:03,722 --> 01:15:06,316
I'm a frightening man, Cammie.

1079
01:15:06,391 --> 01:15:08,825
No, you're not.

1080
01:15:08,894 --> 01:15:11,863
Where Brian's concerned, yes, I am.

1081
01:15:13,165 --> 01:15:15,429
Be kind to him.

1082
01:15:16,201 --> 01:15:19,728
He loves me. I've been loved.

1083
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,606
And that's something everyone
should have once in their life.

1084
01:15:29,047 --> 01:15:31,038
I've been loved.

1085
01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:34,341
I have that.

1086
01:15:40,392 --> 01:15:42,724
Thank you for the prom, Uncle Richard.

1087
01:15:45,597 --> 01:15:47,428
You're welcome.

1088
01:15:51,236 --> 01:15:54,000
Hey, I was looking for yo...
Where are you going?

1089
01:15:54,072 --> 01:15:57,473
I'm wearing a dress, have on heels,
shaved my legs. I'm going to the prom.

1090
01:15:57,542 --> 01:16:00,875
- You said you didn't want to go.
- I said I didn't want to go with you.

1091
01:16:01,646 --> 01:16:03,204
Callie!

1092
01:16:05,617 --> 01:16:09,417
I said I love you. I said it.
I said it out loud to your face.

1093
01:16:09,488 --> 01:16:12,355
And ever since, you...
I've never said that to a guy before.

1094
01:16:12,424 --> 01:16:16,121
Never. And now I am just this idiot who
says I love you and then gets avoided!

1095
01:16:16,194 --> 01:16:18,719
No. I'm not avoiding you.

1096
01:16:20,132 --> 01:16:21,963
I promise.

1097
01:16:22,033 --> 01:16:24,194
You going to say it back?

1098
01:16:24,269 --> 01:16:26,669
- No.
- I'm humiliated.

1099
01:16:26,738 --> 01:16:28,899
No. George. Let me go.

1100
01:16:28,974 --> 01:16:30,669
George, let me go!

1101
01:16:30,742 --> 01:16:33,108
- Wait.
- Let me go. Let me go.

1102
01:16:33,178 --> 01:16:34,805
Stop fighting me!

1103
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:38,782
If I say it back, you'll know I'm just
saying it because you said it to me.

1104
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:43,913
When... when I say I love you...
I want to mean it,

1105
01:16:43,989 --> 01:16:45,616
because...

1106
01:16:48,126 --> 01:16:51,186
You just have to give me
some time to mean it.

1107
01:16:54,299 --> 01:16:56,529
I hate that I'm so into you.

1108
01:17:05,944 --> 01:17:08,538
You're a lot hotter
than my last prom date.

1109
01:17:08,613 --> 01:17:11,343
- Is that a compliment?
- Maybe.

1110
01:17:11,416 --> 01:17:14,214
- It feels like a compliment.
- Well, then it is.

1111
01:17:16,221 --> 01:17:18,451
Well, keep it up. You might get lucky.

1112
01:17:18,523 --> 01:17:21,424
Well, how lucky are we talking?
Are we talking kind of lucky?

1113
01:17:21,493 --> 01:17:24,587
Or are we talking
really, seriously lucky?

1114
01:17:24,663 --> 01:17:28,155
You have been a very patient man
and I appreciate it.

1115
01:17:34,072 --> 01:17:35,096
What?

1116
01:17:36,241 --> 01:17:40,541
Liz, uh... Liz was my wife.

1117
01:17:42,013 --> 01:17:43,844
And when she died...

1118
01:17:44,649 --> 01:17:47,880
You do this thing, you know,
where you stop making plans.

1119
01:17:47,953 --> 01:17:51,389
Because you had plans,
but then there was a car crash

1120
01:17:51,456 --> 01:17:54,050
and your plans disappeared.
So you just...

1121
01:17:56,461 --> 01:17:58,895
I just try and get
from sunup till sundown.

1122
01:17:59,698 --> 01:18:02,098
That's as far into the future
as I can handle.

1123
01:18:02,167 --> 01:18:04,431
And I've been fine with that. I have.

1124
01:18:04,502 --> 01:18:07,062
But right now, looking at you...

1125
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:10,936
Damn, I have all kinds of plans.

1126
01:18:15,313 --> 01:18:17,406
Don't freak out.

1127
01:18:17,482 --> 01:18:19,245
I'm not.

1128
01:18:19,951 --> 01:18:23,409
- You're not?
- No. You have plans.

1129
01:18:25,290 --> 01:18:27,485
I have plans.

1130
01:18:55,287 --> 01:18:58,256
- You all right?
- Yeah, just, uh... hot.

1131
01:18:58,323 --> 01:19:00,257
And, uh, claustrophobic.

1132
01:19:00,325 --> 01:19:02,418
There's a patient I forgot to check on.

1133
01:19:02,494 --> 01:19:05,429
I'm just going to run and splash
some cold water on my face.

1134
01:19:05,497 --> 01:19:07,465
- Be right back, OK?
- Be right back, OK?

1135
01:19:07,532 --> 01:19:09,193
- OK.
- All right?

1136
01:19:11,736 --> 01:19:13,761
- Meredith.
- Leave me alone.

1137
01:19:13,838 --> 01:19:14,862
Meredith.

1138
01:19:17,242 --> 01:19:19,642
- Leave me alone.
- I want to make sure you're all right.

1139
01:19:19,711 --> 01:19:22,043
No! I'm not all right! OK?

1140
01:19:22,113 --> 01:19:24,775
Are you satisfied? I'm not all right!

1141
01:19:24,849 --> 01:19:29,183
Because you have a wife
and you call me a whore and our dog died

1142
01:19:29,254 --> 01:19:31,882
and now you're looking at me.
Stop looking at me!

1143
01:19:31,957 --> 01:19:34,551
I'm not looking at you.
I am not looking at you!

1144
01:19:34,626 --> 01:19:37,789
You are looking at me! And you watch me.

1145
01:19:37,862 --> 01:19:41,161
And Finn has plans and I like Finn.

1146
01:19:41,232 --> 01:19:44,429
He's perfect for me!
And I'm really trying here to be happy!

1147
01:19:44,502 --> 01:19:48,199
And I can't breathe! I can't breathe
with you looking at me like that!

1148
01:19:48,273 --> 01:19:50,264
So just stop!

1149
01:19:52,077 --> 01:19:54,841
Do you think I want to look at you?

1150
01:19:56,581 --> 01:19:58,947
That I wouldn't rather
be looking at my wife?

1151
01:19:59,017 --> 01:20:04,319
I'm married. I have responsibilities.
She doesn't drive me crazy.

1152
01:20:04,389 --> 01:20:07,187
She doesn't make it impossible
for me to feel normal!

1153
01:20:07,258 --> 01:20:09,249
She doesn't make me
sick to my stomach

1154
01:20:09,327 --> 01:20:12,296
thinking about my veterinarian
touching her with his hands!

1155
01:20:12,364 --> 01:20:15,561
Oh, man, I would give anything
not to be looking at you!

1156
01:20:43,628 --> 01:20:46,791
- Oh! You look nice.
- Thank you. So do you. Hot date?

1157
01:20:46,865 --> 01:20:50,130
Nah. This thing is cheesy.
I wouldn't waste a decent chick on this.

1158
01:20:50,201 --> 01:20:51,896
You heading in?

1159
01:20:51,970 --> 01:20:55,565
- Yeah. Just going to see Denny first.
- Oh. OK.

1160
01:20:58,943 --> 01:21:02,310
<i>$ I'm on my knees</i>

1161
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:05,406
<i>$ Only memories</i>

1162
01:21:05,917 --> 01:21:08,681
<i>$ Are left for me</i>

1163
01:21:08,753 --> 01:21:11,051
<i>$ To hold</i>

1164
01:21:13,091 --> 01:21:15,525
<i>$ Don't know how</i>

1165
01:21:16,494 --> 01:21:19,395
<i>$ But I'll get by</i>

1166
01:21:19,964 --> 01:21:24,196
<i>$ Slowly pull myself</i>

1167
01:21:24,269 --> 01:21:27,102
<i>$ Together</i>

1168
01:21:31,076 --> 01:21:35,445
<i>$ I'll get through this</i>

1169
01:21:40,118 --> 01:21:43,485
<i>$ There's no escape</i>

1170
01:21:43,555 --> 01:21:46,683
<i>$ So keep me safe</i>

1171
01:21:47,525 --> 01:21:52,622
<i>$ This feels so unreal</i>

1172
01:21:52,697 --> 01:21:57,225
<i>$ Nothing comes easily</i>

1173
01:21:57,302 --> 01:22:02,171
<i>$ Fill this empty space</i>

1174
01:22:06,211 --> 01:22:10,944
<i>$ Nothing is like it seems</i>

1175
01:22:11,015 --> 01:22:16,385
<i>$ Turn my grief to grace</i>

1176
01:22:20,258 --> 01:22:24,319
<i>$ Nothing is like it was</i>

1177
01:22:24,762 --> 01:22:29,699
<i>$ Turn my grief to grace</i>

1178
01:22:33,671 --> 01:22:37,767
<i>$ Nothing comes easily</i>

1179
01:22:38,476 --> 01:22:43,345
<i>$ Where do I begin?</i>

1180
01:22:47,385 --> 01:22:51,788
<i>$ Nothing can bring me peace</i>

1181
01:22:51,856 --> 01:22:56,350
<i>$ I've lost everything</i>

1182
01:22:59,330 --> 01:23:06,031
<i>$ I just want to feel your embrace $</i>

1183
01:23:17,282 --> 01:23:20,012
- What does this mean?
- Uh, I had panties on.

1184
01:23:20,084 --> 01:23:23,815
- Black. Do you see them?
- Meredith, what does this mean?

1185
01:23:23,888 --> 01:23:25,772
Help me look for them. Fix your tie.

1186
01:23:25,807 --> 01:23:27,657
Meredith. What does this mean?

1187
01:23:31,062 --> 01:23:34,657
Oh, the nurse told me to come find you.
You have to come now. It's Izzie.

1188
01:23:36,601 --> 01:23:38,125
Wait, wait, wait.

1189
01:23:39,938 --> 01:23:41,462
OK, go.

1190
01:24:01,926 --> 01:24:03,689
Chief.

1191
01:24:05,964 --> 01:24:08,091
Did my internship here.

1192
01:24:08,866 --> 01:24:10,800
My residency.

1193
01:24:10,868 --> 01:24:13,735
Came back here the minute
my fellowship was done.

1194
01:24:14,906 --> 01:24:16,840
The day they told me I would be Chief,

1195
01:24:16,908 --> 01:24:21,208
I was standing right there in that OR
when I got the news.

1196
01:24:21,946 --> 01:24:24,471
Spent my whole career in this hospital.

1197
01:24:28,052 --> 01:24:30,111
My whole life.

1198
01:24:31,656 --> 01:24:32,987
Sir...

1199
01:24:38,129 --> 01:24:41,121
Denny Duquette
died at 7:42 this evening.

1200
01:24:46,504 --> 01:24:48,062
Damn it.

1201
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:50,168
What happened?

1202
01:24:50,241 --> 01:24:53,335
I didn't think you guys
would want me to go to the Chief...

1203
01:24:53,411 --> 01:24:56,346
- Where is she?
- She's in there with him.

1204
01:25:05,623 --> 01:25:07,022
Izzie...

1205
01:25:11,929 --> 01:25:13,920
I think it was a stroke.

1206
01:25:14,699 --> 01:25:17,031
He was prone to blood clots.

1207
01:25:18,202 --> 01:25:21,467
A clot could have formed on his sutures
and traveled to his brain.

1208
01:25:21,539 --> 01:25:23,530
It only takes a second.

1209
01:25:23,608 --> 01:25:24,870
Iz...

1210
01:25:24,942 --> 01:25:27,604
Dr. Hahn did a beautiful job
on the surgery.

1211
01:25:30,581 --> 01:25:33,175
But I don't know
why I didn't think of blood clots.

1212
01:25:35,953 --> 01:25:38,285
He died all alone.

1213
01:25:38,356 --> 01:25:39,618
He was alone.

1214
01:25:40,358 --> 01:25:42,553
There was nothing you could have done.

1215
01:25:44,762 --> 01:25:47,162
I changed my dress three times.

1216
01:25:48,933 --> 01:25:50,924
I wanted to look nice.

1217
01:25:52,203 --> 01:25:54,433
I would have been here sooner...

1218
01:25:55,573 --> 01:25:58,041
but I couldn't figure out
which dress to wear.

1219
01:26:00,378 --> 01:26:01,970
Izzie.

1220
01:26:03,881 --> 01:26:05,610
We shouldn't be in here.

1221
01:26:06,551 --> 01:26:08,644
There are things they need...

1222
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:11,154
They need to move him.

1223
01:26:11,222 --> 01:26:13,554
Take him to the morgue.

1224
01:26:16,828 --> 01:26:19,592
You can't stay here. I know you want to.

1225
01:26:19,664 --> 01:26:22,997
Can you please... please just get out?

1226
01:26:26,404 --> 01:26:28,565
I want to be alone with Denny.

1227
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:31,265
Izzie, that's not Denny.

1228
01:26:31,843 --> 01:26:33,674
Shut up.

1229
01:26:35,046 --> 01:26:37,879
Iz. That's not Denny.

1230
01:26:40,051 --> 01:26:43,282
The minute his heart stopped beating,
he stopped being Denny.

1231
01:26:45,289 --> 01:26:47,484
Now, I know you love him,

1232
01:26:47,558 --> 01:26:49,651
but he also loved you.

1233
01:26:50,661 --> 01:26:54,427
And a guy that loves you like that, he
doesn't want you to do this to yourself.

1234
01:26:55,032 --> 01:26:59,025
Because it's not Denny. Not anymore.

1235
01:27:10,648 --> 01:27:13,139
An hour ago he was proposing.

1236
01:27:16,921 --> 01:27:18,786
And now...

1237
01:27:19,857 --> 01:27:22,189
And now he's going to the morgue.

1238
01:27:23,661 --> 01:27:25,822
Isn't that ridiculous?

1239
01:27:28,666 --> 01:27:34,468
Isn't that the most ridiculous
piece of crap you've ever heard?

1240
01:27:43,047 --> 01:27:44,639
Come on.

1241
01:28:56,220 --> 01:28:59,246
- I'm sorry, these are ridic... Hey.
- Hi.

1242
01:28:59,323 --> 01:29:01,484
- Where've you been?
- Uh, I was with...

1243
01:29:01,559 --> 01:29:02,821
- Shepherd.
- Yes.

1244
01:29:02,894 --> 01:29:04,987
Uh, have you seen Bailey's interns?

1245
01:29:05,062 --> 01:29:08,259
Grey? Yang? I'm looking
for Izzie Stevens in particular.

1246
01:29:08,332 --> 01:29:10,857
- No. No.
- Chief.

1247
01:29:33,925 --> 01:29:35,586
It was me.

1248
01:29:38,329 --> 01:29:40,763
I cut his LVAD wire.

1249
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,830
I did it. No one helped me.

1250
01:29:49,206 --> 01:29:50,764
And now...

1251
01:29:52,643 --> 01:29:54,838
I thought I was a surgeon, but...

1252
01:29:57,882 --> 01:29:59,474
I can't.

1253
01:30:00,551 --> 01:30:02,985
I thought I was a surgeon, but I am not.

1254
01:30:07,124 --> 01:30:09,115
So I quit.

1255
01:30:09,827 --> 01:30:11,317
Izzie.

1256
01:30:23,641 --> 01:30:26,974
I guess that...
puts an end to the evening.

1257
01:30:27,945 --> 01:30:31,540
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I guess it does.

1258
01:30:38,155 --> 01:30:40,385
Come on. I'll drive you home.

1259
01:30:57,274 --> 01:30:59,003
Meredith?

1260
01:31:03,114 --> 01:31:04,877
Meredith?
