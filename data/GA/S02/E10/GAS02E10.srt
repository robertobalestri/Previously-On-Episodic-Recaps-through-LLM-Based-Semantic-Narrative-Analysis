00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,992
<i> Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:04,798
You can't help her now.

3
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:07,203
You don't ask
a lot of personal questions.

4
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:09,837
And you're very hard to get to know.

5
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:11,467
Yes.

6
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:14,069
With your reputation,
Seattle Grace will become

7
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,274
one of the foremost neonatal hospitals.

8
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,546
Got a third trimester burn victim,
Dr. Bailey. I need help.

9
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,678
You show a real gift with my specialty.

10
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,814
I'll be staying in town for a while.

11
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,323
Goodbye, Derek.

12
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:27,486
Bye, Meredith.

13
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:31,086
Do you wanna buy me a drink?

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,699
<i> When you were a kid,</i>
<i>it was Halloween candy.</i>

15
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:53,776
<i>You hid it from your parents</i>
<i>and ate it until you got sick.</i>

16
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,957
So, this is where you live?

17
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:09,225
<i>In college, it was the heady combo</i>
<i>of youth, tequila, and, well, you know.</i>

18
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:18,176
<i>As a surgeon, you take</i>
<i>as much of the good as you can get,</i>

19
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:25,140
<i>because it doesn't come around</i>
<i>nearly as often as it should.</i>

20
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,186
<i>Good things</i>
<i>aren't always what they seem.</i>

21
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,192
That was amazing.

22
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,791
Yeah.

23
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,636
<i>Too much of anything, even love,</i>
<i>is not always a good thing.</i>

24
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,072
Did you...

25
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,935
Yeah. I did.

26
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:58,278
- There's a boy in my bed.
- <i> What's his name?</i>

27
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:00,251
Um... Steve.

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,083
- Where'd you find him?
- <i>Joe's.</i>

29
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:06,281
- Guess where I am?
- <i>Where?</i>

30
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,351
Burke's apartment.
He went to the hospital.

31
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,889
He left me here alone.

32
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,298
<i>You're going through his stuff,</i>
<i>aren't you?</i>

33
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:18,360
There's no stuff to go through.
It's a freak show.

34
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,429
You can do surgery in here.

35
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,265
Oh...

36
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,771
He arranged his books
using the Dewey Decimal system.

37
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:31,647
- Mer, I'm scared.
- Get out. Get out of the house now.

38
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,118
Who you talking to?

39
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,519
Uh... I gotta go.

40
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,656
Uh... I have to go take a shower.

41
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:48,031
And when I get back, you won't be here.
So, um... goodbye, Steve.

42
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,388
Another sleepless night in Seattle.

43
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,515
Who was it this time? "Hairy Back Guy"?

44
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:15,584
You know who I miss?
"Inappropriate Facial Hair Guy."

45
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,527
You know, he did his own dishes.

46
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:20,361
"Tattooed Ass Guy" made coffee.

47
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,424
Yeah, he was a keeper.

48
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:27,168
What? What? Meredith?

49
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,902
- I am over her.
- OK.

50
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,206
- I am.
- Yeah, I can see that.

51
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:35,042
But, is she trying to set
some kind of record?

52
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,207
At least she has a goal.

53
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,012
Oh.

54
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:43,988
- He's new.
- And I shall name him: "Running Guy."

55
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,386
You know who I heard Alex
come home with last night?

56
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,555
- You.
- I don't want to talk about it.

57
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:54,099
I really do want to talk about it.

58
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:58,900
He doesn't want to talk about it because
there were technical difficulties.

59
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:02,567
- What?
- You know, he didn't... He...

60
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,976
- No.
- Stop it.

61
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,239
You can't say anything.

62
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,705
- George, stop it.
- I...

63
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:13,115
I'm gonna at least think about
making fun of him when I see him.

64
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:16,747
- He said it never happened before.
- That's what we all say.

65
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,519
And I mean, "they."
That's what "they" all say.

66
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,925
I don't know. Maybe this relationship
just isn't meant to be.

67
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:28,559
I mean, I just need some sex,
George, you know?

68
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,933
I need sex now! You know what I mean?

69
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,143
No matter how hard you beg,
I am not doing you.

70
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,379
- Nice to have you on board.
- Thank you, Patricia.

71
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:53,321
Your own service,
a state-of-the-art NICU,

72
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:57,796
and a salary that makes you one of the
highest-paid surgeons in the northwest.

73
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:00,628
- You better be worth it.
- Quintuplets, Richard.

74
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,134
- That's a go.
- Mother-to-be checked in today.

75
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,500
Nothing I like more
than a high-profile case.

76
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:08,870
Don't go calling the press in yet.
It's a high-risk pregnancy.

77
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:12,468
Three babies are surgical.
I'll need people from all departments.

78
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:15,241
You're my star. Whatever you need.

79
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,242
Is there meal service on this flight?

80
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,517
Robert Martin, 45, hit his head,
causing a small subdural hemorrhage.

81
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:26,114
Also, uncontrolled eye movement
and delirium.

82
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:29,525
Alcohol and tox screens were negative,
but sodium level is 112.

83
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:32,393
- A little too low for my taste.
- <i> Hey! Hey!</i>

84
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,592
Mr. Martin, how are you doing in there?

85
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,660
<i>I'm still waiting on that drink.</i>
<i>Are you the stewardess?</i>

86
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,036
We're called flight attendants now.

87
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,404
<i>Hey!</i>

88
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,464
Hey!

89
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:46,910
There it is. On his pituitary,
it's a Rathke's cleft cyst.

90
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,311
He's hyponatremic.
Thirst is a side effect.

91
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:52,681
- Water's screwing up his sodium levels.
- Causing his delirium.

92
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,084
How do you treat hyponatremia?

93
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:59,386
Three percent hypertonic saline solution
IV, 300 CCs over three hours.

94
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,893
Great. Call me when he stabilizes.

95
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:05,863
- Nicely done, Dr. Karev.
- Hey! When does the movie start?

96
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:09,060
Dorie, this is Dr. Stevens.
She'll be working with us.

97
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,865
- The more, the merrier.
- How far along are you?

98
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,702
- 32 weeks.
- How long is a normal gestation period?

99
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:18,369
40 weeks, but with twins
36 weeks is considered full term,

100
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:21,811
so with quints 34 weeks
is considered extremely successful.

101
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,317
Mom, give him some acetaminophen.
It's in the medicine cabinet.

102
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:29,344
I plan on going 36 weeks. No one's
leaving this uterus until I say so.

103
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,219
Power of positive thinking?

104
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,724
That, bed rest
and all your medical care.

105
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:37,058
We're with the doctors now.
So, I'll talk to you later.

106
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,021
OK, bye.

107
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,593
Adam's got a fever,
so soon they'll all have a fever.

108
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,604
Mom won't make it through lunch.

109
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,573
We have four-year-old boys.
Adam, Oliver, and Graham.

110
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,872
Triplets? You already have triplets?

111
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,404
When you take fertility pills,
you should read the fine print.

112
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,542
- Dr. Stevens...
- I'm sorry, I just... I meant...

113
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,520
It's OK. I'm used to it.
I just really wanted a girl.

114
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:06,422
- We just didn't bank on five girls.
- But think of all the clothes.

115
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:09,984
- And all that pink cuteness.
- That's your happy place, remember?

116
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,051
Oh, yeah.

117
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:16,765
Try not to say everything
that pops into your brain.

118
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,204
They always look so sad
when I kick them out.

119
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:29,411
Seriously, why do guys not understand
that when you pick them up in a bar

120
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:33,646
and take them home for sex, there are no
picket fences or kids in your future?

121
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,389
- Burke "keyed" you?
- I got freaking "keyed" before coffee.

122
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,631
- What is wrong with them?
- They're like these 1950s debutantes.

123
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,098
One dance, and there's
a shotgun to your head.

124
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:50,925
Meredith.

125
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:56,341
- You work here?
- What are you doing here, Steve?

126
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,572
- I'm having a little problem.
- "Steve," Steve?

127
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,875
Actually, I'm having a big problem.

128
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,309
- What?
- Steve, hi. Cristina.

129
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,521
Ever since you and I...
It won't go away.

130
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:16,628
- Cristina!
- What? It's right there, looking at me.

131
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,363
There are so many things
I could say right now.

132
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,966
Champ.

133
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,532
</i>

134
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,696
Do you think it's serious?
It hurts like it is.

135
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,298
You realize this is insane.

136
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,277
We have to stash him somewhere
until we figure this out.

137
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:09,610
- I can't have people finding out.
- I'm not going down for this.

138
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:13,277
- It's not my fault you broke his penis.
- You broke his what?

139
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:16,788
Don't make me chase you down.
I'm growing a person here.

140
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,881
I gotta check on some labs.

141
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,865
How's it look?

142
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,404
- Not bad.
- Not bad?

143
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:35,599
"Not bad" is good when you have
five babies in your uterus.

144
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:45,445
It's Kate. She kicks me so hard
it's like a belly burn every time.

145
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,486
You've named them already?

146
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:50,886
I know you think I'm crazy,
or maybe just a little bit stupid?

147
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,692
Mrs. Russell,
I'm sorry if I've offended you...

148
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,354
The only thing that will offend me
is if you pretend

149
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,227
you didn't judge me immediately.

150
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:04,102
We'll spend a lot of time together,
so we may as well be honest.

151
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,467
If you had reduced the fetuses
even by two,

152
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:15,640
the others could've been carried longer,
been more developed and healthier.

153
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:18,582
You're about the sixteenth doctor
who's told me that.

154
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,949
This one up here, this is Charlotte.

155
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,857
She's the stubborn one.

156
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,226
Lodged under my rib cage
and won't budge.

157
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:36,600
Over here, Lucy.

158
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,432
She's a badass.

159
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,597
She gets kicked, she kicks back.

160
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:47,377
Emily, she has the hiccups
almost every day.

161
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,447
And over here is Julie,
she's pretty mellow.

162
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,985
Every once in a while
she just turns over,

163
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:59,116
which brings us back to Kate.

164
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:04,159
- Who gives you belly burn.
- Every time she kicks.

165
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,894
We were just bringing him up here
because he's got this problem.

166
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,599
And he's a... a friend.

167
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,165
What did your friend take?

168
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,541
- Take?
- Which erectile dysfunction drug?

169
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,739
- You took...
- Absolutely not, I swear.

170
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,408
- It was all natural between us.
- Shut up.

171
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,883
Your condition is called priapism,

172
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,978
usually brought on
by the overuse of EDs.

173
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,546
I didn't take anything.

174
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:35,788
We'll have to take your word for it.
There's no test to see if you're lying.

175
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,886
We'll have to look for other causes.

176
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:41,831
There'll be lots of labs,
lots of procedures.

177
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,528
Painful procedures.

178
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:46,765
Procedures which might make you wish
you never had a penis.

179
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,741
- Sure you won't change your story?
- I swear I'm clean.

180
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,142
All right. Grey, start his workup.

181
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,409
Get some blood.
Get him some meperidine for his pain.

182
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,746
As of now, your friend is admitted.

183
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,649
Dorie Russell,
she's giving birth to quints.

184
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,554
Richard said we were on standby.

185
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:09,526
Which is no problem. It's not like
I have a neurosurgery department to run.

186
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,462
Yes. Apparently our departments
are at her disposal.

187
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:16,160
Do you have time to talk to the mom?
I want her to meet all her surgeons.

188
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,329
- Yes, no problem.
- I'll come by after I finish in the OR.

189
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,600
- Thank you, Dr. Burke.
- Sure!

190
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:26,133
I didn't hear you leave the hotel room
this morning.

191
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,077
I had an early surgery.

192
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,377
You're sure that's all? Nothing's wrong?

193
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,713
No, like I said, I had an early surgery.

194
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:33,774
OK.

195
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,912
I feel like a beached whale.

196
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:39,651
Dorie, this is Dr. Shepherd,
he's our head of neurosurgery.

197
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,523
- Another Dr. Shepherd?
- He's my husband, actually.

198
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:48,227
Seriously? Wow, look at you two.
Everybody must hate you.

199
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,097
You have no idea.

200
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:53,400
Anyway, Dorie, Dr. Shepherd wants to
talk to you about Baby "C."

201
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,737
- Lucy.
- Lucy has hydrocephalus.

202
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,744
It is a build-up of cerebrospinal fluid
on the brain.

203
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,473
OK, and that means...

204
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,277
The fluid puts pressure
on the baby's brain,

205
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,375
which could result in brain damage.

206
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,812
Here's the good news.

207
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,414
We caught it early.
We can take care of it quickly.

208
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,480
How?

209
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,686
I'll install a shunt to drain the fluid.

210
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:18,093
You're looking at a full recovery.

211
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:21,395
- No brain damage?
- No brain damage.

212
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:27,505
OK, really,
couldn't you have led with that?

213
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,006
Good point.

214
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,342
What the hell is this?

215
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,436
- It's a key.
- Why?

216
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:38,415
Why is it a key? Are we feeling
existential this morning?

217
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:43,350
If a key turns in a lock, and no one
asked for the key or even wanted it,

218
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,515
does it make a sound?

219
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,058
Hey.

220
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,184
Hi.

221
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,162
I'm going to take this opportunity
to be someplace else.

222
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,869
- Steve's labs came back clean.
- So?

223
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:00,804
So, someone needs
to induce vasoconstriction.

224
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:05,276
Nice try with the fancy word. He needs
an enema and the answer is "no."

225
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,971
I can't do it.

226
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,537
You let a guy you picked up in a bar
see you naked

227
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,345
- and you can't give him an enema?
- Uncalled for.

228
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,649
- Well, I'm keyed up and cranky.
- I'd do it for you.

229
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:18,781
Oh, really? You'd give Burke an enema?

230
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,325
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

231
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,381
- Maybe.
- Mm-hm.

232
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,087
No. But that's not the point.

233
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,959
Oh, yeah. OK, here's how it goes.

234
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,625
I do this for you and you do every enema
I'm assigned to for a month.

235
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,690
Deal.

236
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,168
You really don't wanna do this.

237
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:39,306
- Have we heard from the seller's agent?
- I've been calling.

238
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:43,405
Mr. Martin, it's good to see you
back on solid ground. I'm Dr. Shepherd.

239
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:46,508
My assistant, Doyle,
says I passed out and hit my head.

240
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,678
This guy says it's some kind of cyst.

241
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:51,814
- I want you to say when I can leave.
- A Rathke's cleft cyst.

242
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,621
- Whatever.
- A congenital tumor on your pituitary.

243
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,059
- Is it treatable?
- You'll need surgery.

244
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:00,587
- I'm gonna use an endonasal approach.
- Endonasal?

245
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,032
You're going to pull it out
through my nose?

246
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,400
Look him up. Check his credentials.

247
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,269
It's minimally invasive
so there won't be scarring.

248
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,401
- Good. So, when?
- When we stabilize your sodium levels.

249
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,038
- That means no more water.
- I'm thirsty.

250
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:18,277
It's a side effect. We'll keep you
hydrated intravenously.

251
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,874
OK?

252
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,912
What the hell are you doing?

253
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,286
I'm just following the doctor's orders.

254
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:34,464
- I cannot believe this is happening.
- Try being me.

255
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:38,333
I mean, you meet someone in a bar,
you have a few drinks, a few laughs,

256
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:41,066
- you make out in the car...
- Roll over to your side.

257
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,131
Other side.

258
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:47,006
- Bring your knees up to your chest.
- You have a good time.

259
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,048
Spend the night,
wake up the next morning and...

260
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,742
- OK!
- Mm-hm.

261
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,384
- Still not talking to me?
- You gave me syphilis.

262
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,789
And I am talking to you.
I just don't have anything to say.

263
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,929
- How's George?
- O'Malley's a fetus.

264
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,064
He's all whiny and afraid of the light.

265
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,606
So you didn't tell him
you were doing me. Big deal.

266
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,510
Minimal disclosure, that's my policy.

267
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,744
Hey. I've been looking for you.

268
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,221
Hey.

269
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,588
- I'm on the quints case.
- Yeah, I heard.

270
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,684
They'll need multiple surgeries.

271
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,127
I put you on the pager list.
So you're in too.

272
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:41,633
Yeah, I kind of got my own cases
to worry about, so...

273
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:46,000
OK, Alex, was it me?

274
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:50,269
Because we seemed to be actually
having a normal time, a good time.

275
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,333
Yeah, we were having a good time.

276
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:55,676
Well, then, was it me?
Was it something I did?

277
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,682
It wasn't you, OK? It was just...

278
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,949
Look, I didn't feel like doing it.
I was tired, you know.

279
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,954
Well, do you feel like doing it tonight?

280
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:12,189
I'm on call, so...

281
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:16,928
OK. Well,
do you feel like doing it now?

282
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,198
Right now?

283
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:23,139
People have sex in this hospital
all the time.

284
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:40,690
- You hear about the quints?
- Yeah, I heard.

285
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,590
I gotta get in on that.

286
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:46,563
Yeah, well, that's Addison,
so I'm guessing I don't stand a chance.

287
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,394
So how do you break a guy's penis?

288
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,366
You know about Steve?

289
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,272
Why does every guy I meet

290
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:01,438
come with his own unique set
of nightmarish humiliations?

291
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:05,506
- Maybe it's a matter of volume.
- Volume? What's that supposed to mean?

292
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,576
I'm just... There's quality
and then there's quantity.

293
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:12,886
So, you think I'm sleeping with too many
guys? You think I'm some kind of slut?

294
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,721
I think you are taking some risks.

295
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,523
I think you'll find yourself
in some guy's basement

296
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,497
being ordered to do things
or you'll get the hose again.

297
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,193
- Come on.
- I'm talking.

298
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,634
So you're not over Derek.
You want to be, but you're not.

299
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:28,730
You're trying to find a replacement,
a way to feel better.

300
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:32,937
But it's not going to work because
a future of meaningless one-night stands

301
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,980
and problematic penises
is not what you want.

302
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,648
You want better, and you deserve better.

303
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,615
And not every guy is a nightmare.

304
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,895
- If it's me, just tell me it's me.
- It's not you.

305
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:58,130
Well, then is it a medical thing,
or a problem?

306
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,433
Because guys have problems sometimes.

307
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,303
I don't have a problem.

308
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:07,235
Get back down here.
We're gonna do this until we do it.

309
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,177
OK.

310
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,255
911. I'm sorry.

311
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,430
Damn it.

312
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:44,681
- Where have you been?
- I um... I... The nurse was here.

313
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,618
I've loaded her up with magnesium.
Start monitoring her for toxicity.

314
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:52,350
It's too soon. They can't come yet.

315
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:55,052
Mom says Graham started puking.

316
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,152
What is it? What's going on?

317
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:00,130
- She's having contractions.
- Vital signs are stable.

318
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,032
Your placenta is laying low.
We'll keep an eye on that.

319
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,659
We want them in there longer.

320
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,136
How, if she's already
having contractions?

321
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,471
They can stop them.
You're going to Trendelenburg me, right?

322
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,739
Yes, I am.
You've done your reading, Dorie.

323
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,746
I did it with the triplets.

324
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,748
Gravity, remember, Tom?

325
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:20,011
It worked fine then
and it'll be fine now.

326
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,883
Hang in there, Tom.
No time for second thoughts now.

327
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:26,516
We didn't think that we'd survive
a week with the boys, and we did.

328
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,891
We'll be the same with the girls.
We're ready.

329
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:35,225
That's all we can do for now.
Dr. Stevens, are you on call tonight?

330
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,928
- No.
- You are now.

331
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,776
- Enema didn't work.
- Enema didn't work?

332
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,544
Enema didn't work.

333
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:53,846
Huh.

334
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,116
- It was an excellent enema.
- So, what's the next step?

335
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,555
A needle aspiration.

336
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,923
A needle? My penis?

337
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,053
We have to drain the blood.

338
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,399
No way! No! Forget it!

339
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:12,301
Then you're looking at impotence,
penile infarction, or gangrene.

340
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,932
- So if you want it to fall off...
- No. No, I really don't want that.

341
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:19,273
Then let's get to it.
What goes up must come down.

342
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,403
I feel nauseous.

343
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,347
Just lie back, close your eyes,
and try to relax.

344
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,884
If I could relax, I wouldn't be here!

345
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,943
Doctor.

346
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,312
How is he?

347
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,485
- Surgery's scheduled for tomorrow.
- Anything I can do?

348
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,926
Don't let him drink any water.
Even if he begs.

349
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,759
Any family we should contact?

350
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:40,991
- No.
- Friends?

351
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,263
He doesn't get on with most people.
Not big on social skills.

352
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,167
- Sad guy.
- Well, he has me.

353
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:49,605
Three years as his assistant.
I guess I'm his friend.

354
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:50,972
Doyle!

355
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,816
What if I just give him back the key?

356
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,977
- He'll be hurt.
- What if I don't use it?

357
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:07,924
If you had no intention of using it,
you shouldn't have taken it.

358
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:13,090
Come on. Fishing a key out of a cup
isn't like some binding legal contract.

359
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,497
Your boyfriend gave you
a key to his place?

360
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,426
Why's he talking?

361
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:22,303
The guy put himself out. He's taking
the next step. You can't not use it.

362
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:25,571
Do you think you might not be
in the best position right now

363
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,737
to be handing out relationship advice?

364
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:31,214
Hey, he offered the key,
you took the key.

365
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,513
Just because I'm...

366
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,052
Look at that!

367
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:39,049
Congratulations.
You're flaccid.

368
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:42,618
Never thought
I'd be so happy to hear that.

369
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:49,031
<i> Dr Jones to Radiology.</i>
<i>Dr Jones to Radiology.</i>

370
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,625
Dorie? Tom?

371
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:57,238
Hey, Dorie. Tom, this is Dr. Burke,
he's the head of cardiothoracic surgery,

372
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,573
and Dr. O'Malley,
who'll be assisting him.

373
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,408
Dr. Burke wanted to talk
about Emily's heart surgery.

374
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,108
- Heart surgery?
- Yes.

375
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:07,413
She has a condition
called hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

376
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:10,319
The surgery will be extensive,
and the odds are...

377
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,358
- We don't believe in odds.
- Good. Neither do I.

378
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:17,225
But it's important that you understand
medically what's going on.

379
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:20,458
After she's born, there won't be
much time to ask questions.

380
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,466
OK.

381
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,594
- We're listening.
- What's wrong with Emily's heart?

382
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,264
The left-side chambers
are underdeveloped.

383
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,004
And the mitral valve, which connects
these chambers, is abnormally narrow.

384
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:50,627
It's a key.

385
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,459
- Just a key?
- Just a key.

386
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,968
Good. Good. Good.

387
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:07,606
Or you could start thinking about
moving in with me.

388
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:21,917
Sorry.

389
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:34,729
Don't mind me.

390
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,939
- What's up with Doyle?
- I had to fire him.

391
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,669
Get me some water. I'm drying up.

392
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:45,978
Yeah, well, that's the tumor talking.
The IV is keeping you hydrated.

393
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,986
So why'd you fire Doyle?
He seemed like a good guy.

394
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:53,049
I could see it in his eyes.
He didn't respect me anymore.

395
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:57,861
He thought he was your friend.

396
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,363
- Friend? Doyle?
- Right. You don't have any friends.

397
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,730
If I did, I wouldn't let them
see me like this.

398
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,160
Illness is a sign of weakness.

399
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:10,197
Once they see it, they look at you
differently. You're a hotshot doctor.

400
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:13,005
I'm sure you don't let
the other hotshot doctors

401
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:15,979
- know about your problems.
- I'm a hotshot doctor.

402
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:17,810
I don't have any problems.

403
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:20,044
Probably don't have any friends either.

404
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,317
Oh, my Lord.

405
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,621
Oh, child.

406
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,161
- Don't tell me.
- The flag is flying once again.

407
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:32,560
Hey, nothing I did.

408
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,963
We've tried everything.
It must be neural.

409
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,230
- Neural?
- She already called for a consult.

410
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:44,070
A consult?
You called Neuro for a consult?

411
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,975
It's not my fault
you broke the boy's penis.

412
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,880
Hello, everybody, what's up?

413
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:04,519
Hm. So when did this problem begin?

414
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:08,157
Well, I had an erection last night
and woke up with one this morning.

415
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,133
Dr. Shepherd, if you don't need me,

416
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:13,329
the other Dr. Shepherd
needs a consult on one of the quints.

417
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,841
Yeah, no, we're fine.
So when did you last ejaculate?

418
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:20,366
I'm not sure. Meredith?

419
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:25,373
Oh, I'm...
I'm going to go with Dr. Bailey.

420
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:30,315
Meredith, what time did we, uh...
you know...

421
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:36,292
Yes, Meredith, what time did you two...

422
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:50,263
Here it is.
Right there, the omphalocele.

423
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:53,277
- Look at that.
- That's the scariest word yet.

424
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:57,645
All it means is some of the baby's
organs are in a sac outside its body.

425
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:00,549
- Cristina!
- "All it means"?

426
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:05,386
Her organs are growing outside of
her body? That's "all it means"?

427
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,255
- It's going to be OK.
- I'll remove the sac membrane

428
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:12,558
containing the organs, make
a small incision in the baby's abdomen

429
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,929
and put them back inside.

430
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,496
Julie.

431
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,562
She's the quiet one.

432
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:38,078
What makes you think... What makes
you think we can live together?

433
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,488
You don't know anything about me.

434
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:49,161
I know that you prefer an eleven blade
for your I and Ds.

435
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:52,397
I know you prefer to say "pick-ups"
instead of "forceps."

436
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,837
I know you like your coffee
from the cart by the front entrance

437
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:58,933
better than the coffee in the cafeteria.
I know you.

438
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:03,003
Those are little things. Just details.

439
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,374
I know you.

440
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,618
You don't want to move.

441
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,556
But I can't always be the one
that takes the step.

442
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,221
Any more steps, and I'm walking away.

443
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:34,376
Mr. Martin! Mr. Martin, please!

444
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:37,381
Mr. Martin, please,
you heard what the doctors said.

445
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:40,714
- I don't need any doctors.
- Open the door, Martin.

446
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:45,984
I'm an island. A beautiful island
surrounded by water.

447
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:49,288
- What do you want to do?
- Shepherd gave me one job to do.

448
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,328
Keep this dude from drinking water.

449
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,159
- Do you want me to page him?
- No.

450
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,132
Get some restraints
and turn the water off to the floor.

451
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,395
Open the door!

452
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:00,267
Your CT shows a tumor
on your lower spine,

453
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:04,604
which is pressing against your cavernous
nerve, which is causing the erection.

454
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:07,611
A tumor? Right.

455
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:12,715
A tumor? So, I should be scared, right?

456
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:15,309
This is the time for "scared."

457
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:20,052
Um... It's going to be fine.

458
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,851
Um, Dr. Shepherd is
gonna schedule surgery.

459
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:27,261
I'll remove the tumor
and everything should return to normal.

460
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,458
"Normal" normal?

461
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:33,596
I have a urologist on his way up to talk
to you, but yes, "normal" normal.

462
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,699
Can you call my mom?

463
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,743
Her number is in my wallet.

464
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:42,712
Don't tell her about the tumor. I don't
want to scare her. She'll be flying.

465
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,715
Sure. OK.

466
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:48,412
- When did you start seeing each other?
- We're not... seeing each other.

467
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,477
We met last night at Joe's.

468
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,580
Joe's Bar?

469
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:53,954
Mm-hm.

470
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,016
I met a girl there once myself.

471
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:01,161
A very long time ago.

472
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,332
The water's off. We'll just have to wait
until he sobers up.

473
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:09,396
His sodium levels will drop too low.

474
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:29,559
No! No!

475
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,094
Leave me alone!

476
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,822
Let me go back. I need the water.
I need it!

477
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:38,528
- Martin, we're trying to help.
- I don't want your help.

478
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:41,333
I don't want people to look at me.
I'm pathetic.

479
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,031
Stop looking at me.

480
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:46,941
Stop looking at me!

481
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:51,175
Give him a three percent
hypertonic solution at 500cc's per hour

482
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:53,513
over the next four hours
to stabilize him.

483
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:57,120
You think you're such a hotshot doctor.

484
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,053
You're not. You're nothing.

485
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:01,057
I'll fire you too.

486
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,750
Go ahead. Fire me.

487
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:20,977
I used the key.

488
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,242
That's a step.

489
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,188
So you really wanna know me?

490
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:39,196
There's nothing you could reveal about
yourself that I wouldn't want to know.

491
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:01,309
This... is where I live.

492
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,012
My mother decorated it.

493
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,885
I don't do laundry. I buy new underwear.

494
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:13,954
And under that table?

495
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:17,695
Six months of magazines I know
I'll never read, but I won't throw out.

496
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:22,206
I don't wash dishes, vacuum,
or put the toilet paper on the holder.

497
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:25,504
I hired a maid once.
She ran away crying.

498
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:30,980
The only things in my fridge are water,
vodka, and diet soda, and I don't care.

499
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,381
But you do.

500
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,321
Still think living together
is a good idea?

501
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,503
Hey. Addison wants me
to put you guys on notice.

502
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:01,477
When the quints are born
we'll need everyone available.

503
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:05,414
Five babies and three surgeries, we're
gonna need all the hands we can get.

504
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,882
- OK.
- Fine.

505
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:11,854
So I'll just page you guys
when we need you?

506
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,823
- OK.
- Fine.

507
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:20,825
- OK, then.
- I was studying. What's your excuse?

508
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:23,662
I was staring at the ceiling
in abject horror.

509
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:26,465
My one-night stand
is a neurosurgical case.

510
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:28,937
I heard you broke his penis. Nice.

511
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,635
So I'm having a lot of sex.
What's wrong with that?

512
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:33,142
Nothing at all.

513
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,441
It gets problematic
when you start to care.

514
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,812
When you let your emotions
get in the way. You know?

515
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:41,808
Yeah. Right.

516
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,918
Damn it.

517
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,063
I'll just get the tea.

518
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:59,259
What is it? Why'd you page me?

519
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:02,431
He was acting all jittery
and started slurring his words.

520
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:03,701
Martin, can you hear me?

521
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:08,045
- He started seizing.
- How much sodium did you give him?

522
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:10,012
500cc over four hours.

523
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:13,380
Actually, you ordered 500cc's per hour
over four hours.

524
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,544
That's too fast. His brain is swelling.

525
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,054
- I thought I said...
- I gave you one thing to do.

526
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,654
- Will he be OK?
- He's currently impaired.

527
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,717
I can't operate on him like this.

528
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,743
I'm sorry.

529
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:50,151
I wasn't trying to get you in trouble,
but Dr. Shepherd needed to know.

530
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:53,588
- It doesn't mean you're a bad doctor.
- Lately, I'm crap.

531
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:59,422
Yeah, well, things have been
kind of crappy for me too lately.

532
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,431
Also my fault.

533
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,163
We both made mistakes.

534
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,061
Let me ask you something.

535
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:12,603
When we were together...
it was good, right?

536
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,102
You mean...

537
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:26,282
Yeah... it was good.

538
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,584
It was really good.

539
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,229
It was pretty great.

540
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:38,132
It was, wasn't it?
It was like, easy, simple.

541
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:54,379
You... better have a condom this time.

542
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:01,291
There it is.
It's on the S1 vertebra.

543
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,586
So removing it
should fix the problem?

544
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,961
Doesn't look like
there's nerve damage.

545
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:10,227
There shouldn't be
any long-term effect.

546
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:13,793
I'd wait a few weeks
before I tested it out, though.

547
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:16,135
Funny. You're a funny man.

548
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,602
I just didn't know you two were dating.

549
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,009
You knew it would happen eventually.

550
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,980
"Eventually" feels a lot different
than "actually."

551
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:28,485
Yeah, I guess it does.

552
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,550
Well, it's surprisingly painful.

553
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,960
It gets better.

554
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,691
Does it?

555
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:44,326
Well, I don't know,
but I'm determined to be optimistic.

556
00:36:57,248 --> 00:37:01,275
So you officially signed your contract.
Congratulations.

557
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:04,378
- Time to move forward.
- Yeah, it is.

558
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,923
We're OK, right?

559
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,327
Yeah. We're OK.

560
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,825
It's Dorie.

561
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,968
- What's going on?
- There's fetal distress.

562
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,275
My contractions are really hurting.

563
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:32,339
And I think my water broke.

564
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,182
Her placenta's tearing.

565
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,884
OK, Dorie, we can't wait any longer.
The babies have to come out now.

566
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:45,719
It's OK. We're gonna take really good
care of you. Just keep breathing.

567
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:54,193
Dorie, the OR is prepped
and ready to go. Where's Tom?

568
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,639
- He's home with the boys.
- No, I called Tom. He's on his way.

569
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:01,872
Izzie, page everyone on Dorie's team.
The list is at the nurse's station.

570
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,251
Dorie, you're fine.
You're going to be fine.

571
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:12,915
Nothing about this is fine.
It's too early. They're too hurt.

572
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,754
Dorie, you've carried your girls
this far.

573
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:20,160
Now it's our turn. You have to
trust us to bring them into the world.

574
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:23,257
- Tom's on his way?
- Tom's on his way.

575
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:29,835
- Hey.
- Hey.

576
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:32,569
I'll just have to tell you
I'm happy to see you.

577
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:38,038
So Dr. Shepherd removed the tumor
without any complications.

578
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:42,074
So I just want to thank you.
For being there for me.

579
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:47,591
I mean, normally,
you don't expect your one-night stand

580
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,683
to stick by you through a tumor.

581
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:53,622
- Maybe when I get out, we could...
- I don't think so.

582
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:56,333
- Sure about that?
- Yeah.

583
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,804
You know, when I saw you at Joe's,
I was just... looking for a replacement.

584
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:04,898
Looking for something
to make me feel better.

585
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:07,771
You deserve better than that.

586
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:19,746
<i> Dr. Bailey, Dr. Burke to</i>
<i>OR one. Dr. Bailey, Dr. Burke to OR one.</i>

587
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:25,288
Sorry. I gotta go.

588
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:34,560
Quints.

589
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:37,607
- Everyone answered except Dr. Karev.
- Where is he?

590
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:40,735
- He was on call, he might be asleep.
- Go find him.

591
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,853
It's time for the quints. We need you.

592
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:37,829
<i> How do you know</i>
<i>how much is too much?</i>

593
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,893
<i>Too much, too soon?</i>

594
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:03,283
<i>Too much information?</i>

595
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,438
<i>Too much fun?</i>

596
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:34,513
<i>Too much love?</i>

597
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,820
<i>Too much to ask?</i>

598
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,508
<i>And when is it all</i>
<i>just too much to bear?</i>
