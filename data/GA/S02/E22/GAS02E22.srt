00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,113
<i>Previously on Grey's Anatomy:</i>

2
00:00:04,353 --> 00:00:07,516
- I told Thatch I'm leaving him.
- You left Thatcher, Ellis.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,218
- If you could hold still...
- I'm working, Thatch.

4
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:11,281
Thatch?

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,157
I look like Meredith's dad?

6
00:00:13,229 --> 00:00:16,460
Why didn't you stay and fight for us?
Why didn't you try harder?

7
00:00:16,532 --> 00:00:19,023
I just saw my father
for the first time in 20 years.

8
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:20,659
I slept with George.

9
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:23,364
Can we please just go back to everything
the way it was?

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,031
I don't know how to go back.

11
00:00:25,107 --> 00:00:28,372
At some point
you are going to have to talk to me.

12
00:00:28,444 --> 00:00:30,969
Want to see something really cool?

13
00:00:32,047 --> 00:00:34,413
All right!

14
00:00:34,483 --> 00:00:38,385
<i>A good basketball game can
have us all on the edge of our seats.</i>

15
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:43,016
<i>Games are all about the glory,
the pain and the play-by-play.</i>

16
00:00:43,092 --> 00:00:46,084
<i>And then there are
the more solitary games.</i>

17
00:00:46,162 --> 00:00:48,289
Dude, is she knitting?

18
00:00:48,364 --> 00:00:51,765
<i>The games we each play all by ourselves.</i>

19
00:00:51,834 --> 00:00:56,396
You know, as a friend, I got to
tell you, you look a little weird.

20
00:00:56,472 --> 00:00:58,463
I am making a sweater.

21
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:01,408
You're knitting. In a bar.
You're scaring the customers.

22
00:01:01,477 --> 00:01:05,038
- Come on, have a drink.
- I can't have a drink. I'm celibate.

23
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:08,015
You mean sober? She means sober.

24
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,607
No. Celibate.

25
00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:13,121
I'm practicing celibacy, and drinking
does not go well with celibacy

26
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:16,090
because it makes everything and everyone
seem kind of porny.

27
00:01:16,158 --> 00:01:19,389
Then my head gets all cloudy
and the next thing, I'm naked.

28
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:24,195
And my point is, I'm celibate, and
knitting is good for surgical dexterity,

29
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:26,131
so I'm making a sweater.

30
00:01:26,202 --> 00:01:28,329
You, celibate?

31
00:01:28,404 --> 00:01:30,531
- I just don't buy it.
- No more men.

32
00:01:30,606 --> 00:01:33,473
No more men? Really? You?

33
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:36,033
And I'm asking because we are friends.

34
00:01:36,111 --> 00:01:38,739
Every guy I meet
turns out to be married.

35
00:01:38,814 --> 00:01:41,681
- Ooh. Ouch.
- Sorry. Or Mark.

36
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,048
- OK, I'm going to go over there now.
- Sorry.

37
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:47,850
Or remember the horrible thing I did?
Remember George?

38
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:52,092
- You're making a sweater.
- I am making a sweater.

39
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:56,461
<i>The social games, the mind games,
we use them to pass the time.</i>

40
00:01:56,532 --> 00:01:58,864
<i>To make life more interesting.</i>

41
00:01:58,934 --> 00:02:01,425
<i>To distract us
from what's really going on.</i>

42
00:02:01,504 --> 00:02:04,496
He's just not George anymore.
He's broken George.

43
00:02:04,573 --> 00:02:08,304
First he chops off his hair. Then he
starts hanging out with this Callie.

44
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:10,709
That is not a name. Callie.

45
00:02:10,779 --> 00:02:13,270
Who is she anyway? I'm his best friend.

46
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:17,752
- Not that he talks to me anymore.
- Triple word score. 69 points.

47
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,617
Woman, I'm beating the pants off you.

48
00:02:19,688 --> 00:02:23,590
- Pay attention. What are you doing?
- I'm knitting a sweater.

49
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:28,653
Actually, Meredith, my friend that broke
George, she is knitting the sweater.

50
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,791
She's not really knitting the sweater
because she cannot knit,

51
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:35,098
but I want her to think she is
because we took a celibacy vow,

52
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,266
so she's replacing sex with knitting, so
I'm knitting some of Meredith's sweater

53
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:43,038
so I can switch them out with hers
so she can really believe she's knitting

54
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:45,945
because if anybody needs to be celibate,
it's Meredith,

55
00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:48,347
because she broke George. You know?

56
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:51,352
- You took a vow of celibacy?
- Yes.

57
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,389
How am I supposed to get in your pants
if you're celibate?

58
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:56,481
That's inappropriate
to say to your doctor.

59
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:58,151
You know what's inappropriate?

60
00:02:58,227 --> 00:03:02,357
Promising sexual favors to a patient
to get him to live and then backing out.

61
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:05,628
Denny Duquette!
I so never ever promised...

62
00:03:05,701 --> 00:03:09,228
In my head, you did.
In my head, you delivered.

63
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:10,795
Well...

64
00:03:10,873 --> 00:03:12,898
Don't worry.

65
00:03:13,642 --> 00:03:16,167
You weren't very good.

66
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:22,510
OK. You know what? I was being nice.

67
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:27,079
I was letting you win. Because you're
"Mr. Sick Needs A New Organ Guy. "

68
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:29,716
But just for that comment,
I'm going to kick your ass.

69
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:34,024
Yeah, I'm going to...
You put down "mount," Denny?

70
00:03:34,096 --> 00:03:38,396
<i>There are those of us
who love to play games. Any game.</i>

71
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:43,336
<i>And there are those of us
who love to play... a little too much.</i>

72
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:47,535
OK, uh, disastrous FEMA director.

73
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,510
- No.
- Oh, uh. Oh.

74
00:03:49,578 --> 00:03:52,547
- Poo is?
- Brown. Poo is brown! Michael Brown!

75
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:54,549
- Yes!
- Time! Time!

76
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:57,415
Whoo!

77
00:04:00,122 --> 00:04:01,851
Yeah, thank you.

78
00:04:01,924 --> 00:04:03,755
- Impressive, O'Malley.
- Thanks.

79
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,384
"Poo is"?

80
00:04:05,461 --> 00:04:08,624
- Apparently, we think alike.
- Can't believe you're proud of that.

81
00:04:08,697 --> 00:04:10,824
Are you supposed
to open that ahead of time?

82
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:12,366
- Hey!
- It's called strategy.

83
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:14,527
- Cristina, it's a game.
- I know that.

84
00:04:14,603 --> 00:04:16,798
You seem a little intense
and we're having fun.

85
00:04:16,872 --> 00:04:19,773
I'm having fun. Let's do this.

86
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:20,968
- OK.
- Are you ready?

87
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:22,510
- Mm-hmm.
- Go!

88
00:04:22,578 --> 00:04:24,205
Blond Ambition tour.

89
00:04:26,482 --> 00:04:28,950
- Blond Ambition tour!
- Oh.

90
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,713
Vogue!

91
00:04:30,786 --> 00:04:33,687
Oh, are you kidding?
OK, she's blonde! She's ambitious!

92
00:04:33,756 --> 00:04:36,953
With the... She's ambitious!
And with the tour! And the vogueing!

93
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,653
Honey, OK, look at me!

94
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:41,594
OK... Shut up! Cones! Cones!

95
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:45,361
Blond ambition, boob cones,
and, uh, vogueing, honey, vogueing.

96
00:04:45,434 --> 00:04:46,662
Sean Penn! Sean Penn!

97
00:04:46,735 --> 00:04:47,963
Time!

98
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:55,409
Zero points for Madonna.

99
00:04:55,477 --> 00:04:59,413
Oh! Madonna. Right.

100
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:03,613
Who doesn't know Madonna?

101
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:06,348
- Sore loser.
- I am not a sore loser.

102
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:11,921
And so what if I am? The point of games
is that there's a winner. A first place.

103
00:05:11,994 --> 00:05:14,428
You want a second-best surgeon
operating on you?

104
00:05:14,496 --> 00:05:17,624
No, you want the very best.
And second best is mediocre.

105
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,659
And to settle for mediocrity is...
is frankly, you know,

106
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:24,763
a sign of self-loathing
and substandard work ethics.

107
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:29,102
I've got to get George
out of my apartment.

108
00:05:29,178 --> 00:05:32,147
You could sleep with him
and right in the middle start crying.

109
00:05:32,214 --> 00:05:35,206
It's painful and humiliating
and unbelievably cruel,

110
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:37,514
but apparently it works.

111
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,851
Would you just keep knitting? Kick him
out so that he can come back home to us.

112
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,552
No, I can't kick him out.
You know, he's Burke's puppy.

113
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:48,995
It's got to be Burke's idea. I just got
to figure out a way to make him do it.

114
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:55,159
Got a lot of metastatic disease
here. How do we proceed?

115
00:05:55,237 --> 00:05:58,798
Definitely excise the endobronchial mets
for symptomatic palliation.

116
00:06:00,242 --> 00:06:03,211
You've been doing
your homework, Karev.

117
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:05,075
Lot of late nights.

118
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:10,515
Look at this. The mets have adhered
to her chest wall.

119
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:12,577
Dude, she's toast.

120
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:16,716
Don't you think
that's a little insensitive?

121
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:19,124
- She can't hear me.
- You don't know that.

122
00:06:19,194 --> 00:06:21,355
Bedside manner
is part of the job, Karev.

123
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,161
Late nights won't get you anywhere.
You have to figure that out.

124
00:06:26,268 --> 00:06:28,896
- Good morning.
- You going into surgery or coming out?

125
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,098
Going in. I had to push back.
Doc's sick.

126
00:06:31,173 --> 00:06:34,267
- What are his symptoms?
- Polydipsia, lethargy, and vomiting.

127
00:06:34,343 --> 00:06:36,834
- Any sign of fever or dehydration?
- It's unclear.

128
00:06:36,912 --> 00:06:39,642
I was considering IV antibiotics
and a saline drip.

129
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:42,445
- Seriously?
- No, Addison. He's a dog.

130
00:06:42,518 --> 00:06:45,282
I dropped him at the vet.
They'll observe him overnight.

131
00:06:45,354 --> 00:06:48,380
- Meredith will check on him.
- I got a transfer in from Mercy West.

132
00:06:48,457 --> 00:06:50,516
- Will you wait for me to get home?
- Yeah.

133
00:06:50,592 --> 00:06:52,355
Today we'll be covering...

134
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:56,225
- Yes?
- Cristina Yang. Surgical intern.

135
00:06:56,298 --> 00:07:01,292
Will we be covering both intra and
extracorporeal knots in today's seminar?

136
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,306
We'll be training in all aspects
of laparoscopic general surgery.

137
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:08,138
- Starting with basic instrumentation...
- Dr. Yang.

138
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,041
Chief.

139
00:07:10,112 --> 00:07:12,103
...including tissue approximation.

140
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,240
The suggested time for...

141
00:07:14,316 --> 00:07:16,045
You're taking the class?

142
00:07:16,118 --> 00:07:18,279
It's a good refresher course.
Should be fun.

143
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,717
Fun. Yeah.

144
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,315
Now, who would like to volunteer
for our first...

145
00:07:25,994 --> 00:07:28,292
Dr. Yang.

146
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:30,957
Molly Thompson, 22 years old,
32 weeks pregnant.

147
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,762
Transferred from Mercy West

148
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:36,896
when an ultrasound diagnosed the baby
with congenital diaphragmatic hernia.

149
00:07:36,972 --> 00:07:39,133
Hello, Molly. I'm Dr. Addison Shepherd.

150
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,775
You're supposed to be the best.

151
00:07:41,844 --> 00:07:43,539
And not to put any pressure on you,

152
00:07:43,612 --> 00:07:45,978
but this is my baby
carrying my grandchild

153
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,949
so I really hope that you are.
The best, I mean.

154
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:52,646
Mom, you're kind of threatening
the doctor. Don't threaten the doctor.

155
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:53,745
Sorry.

156
00:07:53,822 --> 00:07:56,848
My husband tells me I have
to try not to be such a mother lion

157
00:07:56,925 --> 00:08:00,691
because Molly's a grown woman and
has her own life and everything, but...

158
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:03,661
roar.

159
00:08:03,732 --> 00:08:06,667
It's OK. I can take it. I am the best.

160
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:09,033
You can fix this, though? Right?

161
00:08:09,104 --> 00:08:11,004
We'll insert a scope into your uterus

162
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,507
and then inflate a balloon
in the baby's airway

163
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:16,373
which should help stimulate the lungs
to grow.

164
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:18,777
It's not going to be easy
on either of you.

165
00:08:18,847 --> 00:08:22,214
But I do have a strong record
with this surgery.

166
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:26,354
Make sure you get her to the MRI and
get me the results as soon as you can.

167
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:27,786
I will.

168
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:35,288
Sir? Can I help you find something?

169
00:08:35,364 --> 00:08:36,888
Uh...

170
00:08:36,965 --> 00:08:41,925
Is there
a Dr. Meredith Grey working today?

171
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:43,266
Yes.

172
00:08:43,338 --> 00:08:45,397
She's here in the hospital, right now?

173
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:47,908
I can have someone page her for you
if you want me to.

174
00:08:47,976 --> 00:08:51,173
No. No. Thanks.

175
00:08:52,614 --> 00:08:54,138
Wait! Excuse me, sir.

176
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,348
Are you... What's your name?

177
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:59,148
Thatcher.

178
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:01,348
- You're...
- Grey. Yeah.

179
00:09:02,157 --> 00:09:05,354
- You're Meredith's father.
- Yeah.

180
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:07,759
Are you sure you don't want me
to page her for you?

181
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:10,297
No. I'm sorry. It's complicated.

182
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:12,799
Thatcher, honey? We're right here.

183
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:15,200
Oh. Oh. There you are, Susan.

184
00:09:16,004 --> 00:09:19,167
Did you tell him? I roared a little.
Couldn't help it.

185
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:22,005
Oh. Oh, well, I knew you would.

186
00:09:22,077 --> 00:09:23,101
Uh...

187
00:09:23,178 --> 00:09:25,908
I'm sorry, I'm Dr. O'Malley.
I'm, uh...

188
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:31,146
Uh, well, Excuse us.
Uh... check on our daughter.

189
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,426
Uh, Dr. Bailey!
You have an extra intern?

190
00:09:48,503 --> 00:09:51,097
- I'm available.
- No, no, no, no. I said intern.

191
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:54,301
- Shepherd, look at the board.
- OK. What am I looking at?

192
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:57,812
My name isn't there. It wasn't there
yesterday and it won't be tomorrow.

193
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,870
- Did you piss off the Chief?
- Yeah.

194
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:03,884
I went and had a baby. I gave birth.
I created a human life. I'm a surgeon.

195
00:10:03,952 --> 00:10:06,614
We don't do that.
He's mommy tracking me.

196
00:10:06,688 --> 00:10:10,647
- He's just going easy on you.
- No, I change diapers, I clean spit up,

197
00:10:10,726 --> 00:10:15,220
I sing the ABCs. I'm covered in mommy.
But I will not be mommy tracked!

198
00:10:15,297 --> 00:10:17,959
- You're freaking out.
- I just need a surgery. Now.

199
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:20,729
So for today, I'm your intern.

200
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:25,631
I have not begun to freak out.

201
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:27,004
All right. Come on.

202
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:30,567
Cristina told me that George
had a date with Ortho Chick.

203
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:33,341
Games night. She didn't even
take him home afterwards.

204
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:37,010
She hinted that she wanted to and then
said she couldn't. Weird, right?

205
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:40,577
George made it perfectly clear
that I'm not in his life anymore.

206
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:43,021
Think Ortho Chick is hiding something?

207
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:45,924
Stevens. Hold this.

208
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:49,924
George mentioned
you're not big on ortho.

209
00:10:49,998 --> 00:10:52,057
Grey? Take the osteotome and the mallet.

210
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:55,529
Follow me.

211
00:10:58,373 --> 00:11:01,206
Ms. Carver, unfortunately,
we found that the cancer

212
00:11:01,276 --> 00:11:03,437
has metastasized to your chest wall.

213
00:11:03,512 --> 00:11:06,310
We took out a small tumor
obstructing your airway

214
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:10,408
which will help with your breathing,
but... it's not a cure.

215
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,986
So this is the end of the line.
That's what you're saying? I die now?

216
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:21,462
- Beatrice...
- I want you to go back in

217
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,988
and I want you to cut out everything
that you can. As much as you can.

218
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:28,696
I want as much time as you can give me,
you understand?

219
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,795
Unfortunately, additional surgery...

220
00:11:30,872 --> 00:11:32,464
Excuse me.

221
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,203
Mom, I'm not eating
any of that crap in the cafeteria.

222
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,507
We'll have to order in
Thai food or something

223
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:40,070
because I'm starving
and the food here blows.

224
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:45,645
I'll have the nurse bring a menu by
and we can have a picnic in bed.

225
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,885
- God, how many doctors do you have?
- They were just leaving.

226
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,894
<i>After trailing by ten at the half,
the offense stepped up.</i>

227
00:11:53,962 --> 00:11:57,728
<i>Leading a 13 and 0 run to begin
a seesaw battle right up to the end.</i>

228
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:02,668
In five to ten years, cutting, as we
know it, will be virtually obsolete.

229
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,867
- Very nice, Dr. Yang.
- Thank you, sir.

230
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:17,415
A little less tension there, Chief.
Watch your grip. There you go.

231
00:12:22,824 --> 00:12:25,759
- I wasn't copying you.
- Of course not, sir.

232
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:31,359
Done! I'm done!

233
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:33,196
I totally finished first. I'm done.

234
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:39,964
- So, Dr. Torres...
- Hold it steady, Grey.

235
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,703
Did you always want to specialize
in orthopedics?

236
00:12:42,777 --> 00:12:44,768
Did you always want to model?

237
00:12:44,846 --> 00:12:47,246
Oh. OK.

238
00:12:47,315 --> 00:12:49,749
Grey, I mean it. Watch your grip.

239
00:12:49,818 --> 00:12:52,150
And your husband? Is he a doctor too?

240
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,314
What are you trying to ask me,
Dr. Stevens?

241
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,917
My history? My marital status?
My deep dark little secrets?

242
00:12:58,994 --> 00:13:02,293
- I'm George's best friend.
- Oh, I see.

243
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:05,299
Well, it's just funny
because from what I understand,

244
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,734
as his best friend, you haven't been
the best matchmaker in the past.

245
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:18,640
- Hi.
- Hey.

246
00:13:18,713 --> 00:13:21,307
Your hair's growing.
I still think you should cut it.

247
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,443
I could cut it for you,
if we still lived together.

248
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:28,080
Or we could just hang out
and talk, about stuff.

249
00:13:28,156 --> 00:13:31,557
Like your new friend. Callie.

250
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:34,595
She's, uh, she's very, um...

251
00:13:35,697 --> 00:13:39,360
You know, if you like her,
I will like her. Eventually.

252
00:13:39,434 --> 00:13:41,163
- I can't escape her.
- What?

253
00:13:41,236 --> 00:13:45,502
All I want to do is forget her. All I
want to do is just escape her and...

254
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,337
you know, I can't.

255
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,536
You want to escape Callie?

256
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:51,704
Thank God,
because she is like a total freak

257
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,943
and I'm starting to get
really worried about you.

258
00:13:56,251 --> 00:13:58,242
Not Callie.

259
00:13:59,454 --> 00:14:01,479
Sorry. Oops.

260
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:04,719
Who? Or, uh... Oh! Meredith again.

261
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:06,385
Let me tell you something.

262
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:10,795
The minute I tell you this,
it officially becomes your problem.

263
00:14:10,865 --> 00:14:13,527
- Not mine.
- OK.

264
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:18,830
Meredith has a sister.

265
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:22,903
- How we doing?
- Turning the skull flap.

266
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:25,947
- Patient's sedated.
- Very nice. Nicely done.

267
00:14:28,783 --> 00:14:30,944
- He's a kid.
- Yes.

268
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:35,456
I just didn't think it would be a kid.
A tumor that size...

269
00:14:35,523 --> 00:14:38,048
- What happens now?
- Now we wake him up.

270
00:14:38,126 --> 00:14:41,721
- We're doing awake brain surgery?
- Yes. Thank you.

271
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:45,189
Andrew?

272
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:48,461
A little more. Andrew?

273
00:14:48,536 --> 00:14:50,003
Can you hear me?

274
00:14:51,573 --> 00:14:54,371
Hey. Want to count for me?

275
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,774
- One...
- Good. Keep going.

276
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,411
Two.

277
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:03,673
Three.

278
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:09,420
The tumor is located near
the language center of the brain.

279
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,789
It's always important
that we don't damage it.

280
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,557
Andrew? I need you to keep talking.
Can you do that? Can you talk to me?

281
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,928
I'II... I'll try.

282
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:21,935
- Great. Now what grade are you in?
- Um... seventh.

283
00:15:22,437 --> 00:15:24,098
You into sports?

284
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:26,800
- Not really.
- How about baseball?

285
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:31,278
Um... baseball's a sport.

286
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:37,341
Right. OK. What about, uh, girls?
Do you have any girlfriends?

287
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:40,286
No.

288
00:15:41,923 --> 00:15:47,555
Um... you probably don't have time
for girlfriends, right, Andrew?

289
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:50,257
- Probably too busy, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

290
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:52,425
What are you busy doing?

291
00:15:53,968 --> 00:15:56,493
Getting ready for
the National Spelling Bee.

292
00:15:56,571 --> 00:15:59,870
I won the greater regionals last month.

293
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:03,433
Oh, well, in that case, you need
to spell some words for us.

294
00:16:03,511 --> 00:16:06,105
- Uh, can you do that?
- Sure.

295
00:16:06,181 --> 00:16:09,173
Good. Uh...

296
00:16:10,652 --> 00:16:12,916
You usually provide the word,
Dr. Bailey.

297
00:16:12,987 --> 00:16:15,148
I don't hear you coming up with one.

298
00:16:15,223 --> 00:16:20,251
Uh, let's see. Oh, right!
Um, "acetaminophen. "

299
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:23,323
Acetaminophen.

300
00:16:23,398 --> 00:16:25,195
Origin of the word?

301
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:27,200
Heck if I know.

302
00:16:29,671 --> 00:16:33,368
- Do you have Molly's MRI results?
- No. I haven't. Not yet.

303
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:36,103
- What the hell have you been doing?
- I was just going...

304
00:16:36,177 --> 00:16:38,304
When I assign you to a case of mine

305
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,406
I expect you to give it
your full and undivided attention.

306
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:44,646
Give me one good reason why
I shouldn't take you off this case.

307
00:16:47,222 --> 00:16:49,417
Molly Thompson's maiden name is Grey.

308
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:52,153
Her father is Thatcher Grey,
who is Meredith's father,

309
00:16:52,227 --> 00:16:56,459
so Molly and Meredith are sisters, but I
don't think Meredith knows Molly exists.

310
00:16:56,531 --> 00:16:58,192
That... I don't care.

311
00:16:58,266 --> 00:17:02,999
I don't, except I'm on this case
and apparently God hates me.

312
00:17:05,206 --> 00:17:07,037
- OK.
- OK. Thanks.

313
00:17:10,211 --> 00:17:13,180
I want all this out now.
I'm getting out of the hospital.

314
00:17:13,248 --> 00:17:17,309
- Oh, we can't, Beatrice.
- Tomorrow is my daughter's birthday.

315
00:17:17,385 --> 00:17:21,014
Apparently, it's the last one I get to
celebrate. I'm not spending it here.

316
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:25,150
OK, I'm so sorry. But if we remove
this tube, your lung will collapse.

317
00:17:25,226 --> 00:17:27,456
You don't want to spend her birthday
this way.

318
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:29,724
I'm a quick healer.
I'm breathing better.

319
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,426
The removal of some of the tumor
opened up your airway.

320
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,491
That doesn't mean that you are well.

321
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:37,003
You're at risk of infection
or hemorrhage.

322
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:39,369
Your kid doesn't even know
you have cancer.

323
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:42,968
You really want to risk dropping dead
on the street outside the hospital?

324
00:17:47,615 --> 00:17:49,583
Dr. Karev.

325
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:53,747
So you thought... scaring her
back in the bed was the way to go?

326
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,620
It worked, didn't it?
She's lying to her kid.

327
00:17:56,691 --> 00:17:58,454
She's frightened. She's in shock.

328
00:17:58,526 --> 00:18:02,155
It is not your job or your place
to take a tone like that with a patient.

329
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,996
Not ever. Are we understood?

330
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:08,262
Yes, sir.

331
00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:13,471
So what are the sister
and the father like?

332
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:17,875
Like? They're like people Meredith
is related to and never met.

333
00:18:17,946 --> 00:18:20,414
- They're nice.
- Can you imagine?

334
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:24,578
A sister, a whole family
you know nothing about.

335
00:18:24,652 --> 00:18:28,213
- You think she's going to freak out?
- It's not my responsibility to care.

336
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:30,154
Heads up. Heads up.

337
00:18:31,025 --> 00:18:32,492
Hey, Chief.

338
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,463
Seems I'm a little rusty
on my bead transfer and rope pass.

339
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:40,228
Dr. Yang here,
has been kicking my ass all day.

340
00:18:40,301 --> 00:18:43,464
- Oh, I can't imagine, Chief.
- No, really, she has.

341
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:46,268
Of course, speed and precision

342
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:49,276
aren't the most important
surgical skills, Dr. Yang.

343
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:55,308
The basics are the key. You need
a solid foundation before anything else.

344
00:19:06,294 --> 00:19:08,990
OK, um...
Well, I'll see you back at the lab.

345
00:19:09,063 --> 00:19:10,826
- Enjoy your lunch.
- You too.

346
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,526
Have a nice day, sir.

347
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,262
OK, I really am
kicking the Chief's ass.

348
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:22,266
- George.
- Not my responsibility.

349
00:19:22,343 --> 00:19:24,675
- See you guys.
- So who's going to be the...

350
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:28,182
It's OK. I can accept rejection.
I've got my knitting.

351
00:19:28,249 --> 00:19:30,877
- Mer...
- The weird thing is,

352
00:19:30,952 --> 00:19:36,322
- I thought I just saw my father.
- Oh. That's good. That's so good.

353
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:38,484
Hmm. Did you meet your sister too?

354
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:46,760
"Appoggiatura" won last year.

355
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:50,133
The year before that? Akshay Buddiga.

356
00:19:50,204 --> 00:19:54,368
He fainted, then got up
and spelled the word "alopecoid. "

357
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:56,376
Kid's a major legend.

358
00:19:56,444 --> 00:20:00,744
All right. Now it's my turn.
"Fibromyalgia. "

359
00:20:00,815 --> 00:20:03,375
- Fibromyalgia?
- What's wrong with fibromyalgia?

360
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:06,443
Andrew won the regionals.
He's going to D.C.

361
00:20:06,521 --> 00:20:09,149
He's probably insulted by fibromyalgia.

362
00:20:09,223 --> 00:20:11,123
- Fibromyalgia.
- Suction.

363
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:16,186
F- I-B-R-O-M-Y-A-L-G-I-A.

364
00:20:16,264 --> 00:20:18,061
Fibromyalgia.

365
00:20:18,132 --> 00:20:21,465
- She's right. That was kind of easy.
- OK.

366
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:27,031
You want me to bring on the heat?
I'll bring on the heat. "Omphalocele. "

367
00:20:28,142 --> 00:20:31,771
- Omphalocele.
- Mm-hmm. More suction in there.

368
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:33,575
Omphalocele.

369
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,584
OK.

370
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:41,383
Andrew? What's happening?

371
00:20:41,456 --> 00:20:44,687
Mark that. We've hit the language
center. We have to pull back.

372
00:20:49,263 --> 00:20:51,754
Andrew?

373
00:20:55,203 --> 00:20:57,171
Andrew?

374
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,742
Oh, Andrew. Andrew.
Uh, spell it again for me.

375
00:21:03,945 --> 00:21:06,379
Give me the probe.

376
00:21:06,447 --> 00:21:09,473
Dr. Shepherd's working on it.
I don't want you to be scared.

377
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:13,418
I want you to wait.
Wait, I want you to hold on.

378
00:21:13,488 --> 00:21:15,718
Mark that as well, please.

379
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,917
- OK, try now.
- OK.

380
00:21:17,992 --> 00:21:23,055
All right, Andrew, spell "omphalocele"
one more time for me.

381
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,859
Omphalocele.

382
00:21:27,935 --> 00:21:29,664
Mark that, please.

383
00:21:29,737 --> 00:21:36,768
O- M-P-H-A-L-O-C-E-L-E.

384
00:21:36,844 --> 00:21:40,109
- Omphalocele.
- That's it. That's perfect.

385
00:21:41,516 --> 00:21:45,418
Dr. Bailey, are you crying?

386
00:21:45,486 --> 00:21:47,647
Ooh! I got something in my eye.

387
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,820
You're doing great, Andrew.

388
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,952
- We're almost done.
- Stop looking at me like that.

389
00:21:54,028 --> 00:21:55,962
- It's my hormones.
- Mm-hmm.

390
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:59,431
I'm still a surgeon. I'm just a surgeon
with an excess of estrogen.

391
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,162
Deal with it.
Andrew, can you spell "estrogen"?

392
00:22:02,236 --> 00:22:07,139
E- S-T-R-O-G-E-N.

393
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,870
Here's a word for you. "Delusional. "

394
00:22:09,944 --> 00:22:11,809
Delusional.

395
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:20,979
Today's final assignment will show
how well you can take the skills

396
00:22:21,055 --> 00:22:24,684
you have learned and apply them
to a single operation.

397
00:22:26,661 --> 00:22:28,288
You may begin.

398
00:22:28,362 --> 00:22:30,762
So I'm going do the surgery
with a small scope.

399
00:22:30,832 --> 00:22:32,390
It will be minimally invasive.

400
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:35,163
You'll be able to do
the rest of your recovery from home.

401
00:22:35,236 --> 00:22:36,464
Thank you.

402
00:22:36,537 --> 00:22:38,528
Yeah. OK.

403
00:22:41,242 --> 00:22:43,233
Uh...

404
00:22:44,979 --> 00:22:48,608
Uh, Molly, this is Dr... uh...
This is Meredith.

405
00:22:48,683 --> 00:22:54,178
She's going to be... continuing your
prep work and taking your vitals. OK?

406
00:22:54,255 --> 00:22:55,847
OK.

407
00:22:56,724 --> 00:22:58,692
- Hi.
- Hey.

408
00:22:59,594 --> 00:23:02,256
- Uh, do you mind if I, um?
- No, it's fine.

409
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,560
I'm getting used to being
poked and prodded.

410
00:23:07,668 --> 00:23:09,659
That's, uh, a pretty ring.

411
00:23:09,737 --> 00:23:13,537
Oh, thanks. It was my grandma's
and then my mom's.

412
00:23:15,777 --> 00:23:18,177
You think I'm too young to be married.

413
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:19,838
- No, I...
- That's OK.

414
00:23:19,914 --> 00:23:23,873
Everybody thinks I'm too young.
If I saw me, I'd think I was too young.

415
00:23:23,951 --> 00:23:26,511
Um, how... how old are you?

416
00:23:26,587 --> 00:23:28,953
22. Eric's 23.

417
00:23:29,023 --> 00:23:31,890
And he's in the army
and he was getting shipped out.

418
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:34,860
And... I just love him so much,
you know?

419
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:36,988
Anyway, I proposed.

420
00:23:37,064 --> 00:23:38,861
Oh.

421
00:23:38,933 --> 00:23:41,128
And your, uh, parents? They approve?

422
00:23:41,202 --> 00:23:43,466
Oh. Oh, my parents are amazing.

423
00:23:43,538 --> 00:23:46,598
You know how dads can be.
Mine's pretty overprotective.

424
00:23:46,674 --> 00:23:50,166
But... you know, at my wedding,
when he gave me away,

425
00:23:50,244 --> 00:23:52,906
my dad cried, which was...

426
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,245
I had never seen my dad cry before.

427
00:23:56,317 --> 00:24:01,277
But I think it was also kind of weird
for him 'cause I'm his little girl.

428
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:04,688
I'm the youngest, and my sister's
nowhere near ready for marriage.

429
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:06,818
But... it was good crying.

430
00:24:06,894 --> 00:24:10,227
Like... he was proud of me, you know?

431
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,824
I'm sorry. I'm nervous, so I'm talking.

432
00:24:15,837 --> 00:24:19,238
- No, that's OK. So you have a sister?
- Yeah. Lexie.

433
00:24:19,307 --> 00:24:22,299
She's in medical school. Harvard.
She's the smart one.

434
00:24:22,376 --> 00:24:26,472
You should see how my dad
is about her. He's like crazy proud.

435
00:24:30,718 --> 00:24:32,743
- Well, I'm going to go.
- Meredith?

436
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,688
- Hmm?
- Do you think my baby's going to be OK?

437
00:24:36,757 --> 00:24:38,952
Oh. Well, I hope so.

438
00:24:39,026 --> 00:24:40,789
Me too.

439
00:24:40,862 --> 00:24:42,352
OK.

440
00:24:48,636 --> 00:24:50,763
- I need some bones to break.
- What?

441
00:24:50,838 --> 00:24:54,103
Some bones to break. Something
to smash. Can you help me with that?

442
00:24:54,175 --> 00:24:57,201
Um... you can clean up this cast crap
if you want.

443
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,878
- She freaking out?
- No. Uh-uh. She's fine.

444
00:25:04,952 --> 00:25:06,783
- Oh.
- She's great.

445
00:25:10,024 --> 00:25:12,788
So, George...
he's really, really your type, huh?

446
00:25:16,063 --> 00:25:18,122
You don't see him.

447
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:20,690
Either of you. You don't see him.
He's just...

448
00:25:20,768 --> 00:25:22,895
He's just George to you. He's...

449
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:26,303
- He's just O'Malley. Your roommate.
- You don't have to get all up...

450
00:25:26,374 --> 00:25:28,604
He makes my world stop.

451
00:25:28,676 --> 00:25:34,046
George O'Malley is sweet and kind,
and smart and strong.

452
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,583
And he makes my world stop.
So you shut up about him.

453
00:25:39,253 --> 00:25:42,882
Don't forget to clean it up.
When you're done smashing.

454
00:25:47,762 --> 00:25:50,890
Holy crap. George is her McDreamy.

455
00:25:51,832 --> 00:25:54,096
Oh.

456
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,780
I'm done! I'm done! I'm done!

457
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:19,723
Flawless, Chief Webber.
Absolutely flawless.

458
00:26:19,794 --> 00:26:22,160
They call me Dr. Webber!

459
00:26:25,566 --> 00:26:28,467
That's why I'm the Chief.

460
00:26:32,673 --> 00:26:34,538
That's why I'm the Chief!

461
00:26:35,376 --> 00:26:37,537
<i>That's why I'm the Chief</i>

462
00:26:37,611 --> 00:26:38,600
Chief.

463
00:26:39,914 --> 00:26:41,643
So when is my mom getting out of here?

464
00:26:41,716 --> 00:26:44,514
I'm sorry, honey,
but it's going to be a few days.

465
00:26:44,585 --> 00:26:47,145
Can you call Aunt Sue?
See if she can pick you up?

466
00:26:47,221 --> 00:26:50,213
So I get to spend my birthday
hanging out with Aunt Sue?

467
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:52,782
- Perfect.
- I promise you, next year.

468
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,421
Next year we'll do something
really special for your birthday.

469
00:26:56,497 --> 00:26:59,330
You name it. It's done. I promise.

470
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:02,428
Whatever.

471
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:11,072
So, this whole lying thing?
This is working out for you?

472
00:27:11,145 --> 00:27:13,613
Excuse me?

473
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:16,673
You're going to die. And soon.
You get that, right?

474
00:27:16,751 --> 00:27:19,584
There's no rosy picture to paint here.

475
00:27:19,653 --> 00:27:21,814
You're not a mother.

476
00:27:21,889 --> 00:27:25,757
You don't know what it's like
to hold your newborn baby in your arms,

477
00:27:25,826 --> 00:27:30,763
and smell her head and know that your
only job in the world is to protect her.

478
00:27:30,831 --> 00:27:33,561
- You think you're protecting her?
- I am protecting her.

479
00:27:33,634 --> 00:27:35,499
I guess you can call it what you want.

480
00:27:35,569 --> 00:27:38,037
But you should know,
you're leaving behind a kid

481
00:27:38,105 --> 00:27:40,767
that will probably hate you
the rest of her life.

482
00:27:44,545 --> 00:27:47,378
- Dr. Karev...
- No. I'm talking this time.

483
00:27:47,448 --> 00:27:50,542
- Excuse me?
- I tell the truth. It's what I do.

484
00:27:50,618 --> 00:27:55,317
It doesn't make me a bad doctor.
Everyone walks around this place lying.

485
00:27:55,389 --> 00:27:59,348
We tell the patient that's dying that
there is hope when there is no hope.

486
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:02,885
Maybe I'm a pig. Maybe I'm an ass.
Maybe I'm a vermin like everybody says.

487
00:28:02,963 --> 00:28:06,330
But I tell them the truth. It's the
one thing that I've got going for me.

488
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,463
And you don't get to take that away
from me and call it a lesson, sir.

489
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:26,577
I saw a picture once
from a long time ago.

490
00:28:26,654 --> 00:28:29,748
You look just like her. Your mother.

491
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,951
You look a lot like my girls.

492
00:28:32,026 --> 00:28:34,324
Especially Molly.

493
00:28:34,395 --> 00:28:37,694
- You were talking to her?
- I didn't say anything about anything.

494
00:28:37,765 --> 00:28:39,699
Oh, she knows about you.

495
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:43,703
Or she knows that her father was married
before and had another daughter.

496
00:28:43,771 --> 00:28:46,706
- Has another daughter.
- No, had is right.

497
00:28:48,209 --> 00:28:50,177
Your father thinks about you.

498
00:28:51,178 --> 00:28:53,169
He thinks about you a lot.

499
00:28:53,848 --> 00:28:55,941
He just...

500
00:28:56,951 --> 00:28:58,509
Your mother...

501
00:29:00,154 --> 00:29:02,247
Your mother...

502
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,553
She broke him.

503
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:07,458
Excuse me. I... I have to work.

504
00:29:21,475 --> 00:29:24,376
I spent years studying this board.

505
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:29,540
Holding a crying baby,

506
00:29:29,617 --> 00:29:34,111
trying to get an idea
when my wife would get out of surgery.

507
00:29:34,188 --> 00:29:36,918
Appy takes about an hour.

508
00:29:37,892 --> 00:29:40,258
Anything with the word "cardio"

509
00:29:40,327 --> 00:29:43,558
and I knew not to plan on
seeing her at all that day.

510
00:29:47,968 --> 00:29:51,563
Thatcher. Are you aware
of what's going on with Ellis?

511
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,364
You have no right.

512
00:29:54,942 --> 00:29:57,308
No right to talk to me about Ellis.

513
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:01,508
I'm sorry. But I was trying
to talk to you about Meredith.

514
00:30:04,151 --> 00:30:07,917
Thatcher,
Ellis has early onset Alzheimer's.

515
00:30:07,988 --> 00:30:09,683
It's advanced.

516
00:30:10,658 --> 00:30:13,525
And it's hard on Meredith,
as you can imagine.

517
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,998
And I thought you'd want to know.

518
00:30:33,647 --> 00:30:35,444
Hey, Andrew.

519
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:38,646
It's Dr. Bailey.

520
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:42,177
Remember me?
I was in surgery with you.

521
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:45,759
I'm... I'm sorry.

522
00:30:45,826 --> 00:30:48,124
No, don't worry. Don't worry.

523
00:30:48,195 --> 00:30:53,223
A lot of times kids who are awake during
surgery don't remember afterwards.

524
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,736
Anyway, your operation went really well.

525
00:30:56,804 --> 00:31:00,399
We got all that tumor out of there
and you're going to be just fine.

526
00:31:00,474 --> 00:31:03,375
I... I... Thanks.

527
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,469
OK.

528
00:31:08,315 --> 00:31:10,613
You know, I have a son, too.

529
00:31:10,684 --> 00:31:13,482
And I'm going home right now

530
00:31:13,554 --> 00:31:17,684
to tell him that today
I met the best speller in Seattle.

531
00:31:35,242 --> 00:31:37,233
- Oh, hey. Dr. O'Malley.
- Hi.

532
00:31:37,311 --> 00:31:39,711
I was looking for you. You're...

533
00:31:40,914 --> 00:31:44,680
Before, when I was asking
about Meredith, you know her.

534
00:31:44,752 --> 00:31:47,448
- You're her friend?
- I used to be her roommate.

535
00:31:47,521 --> 00:31:49,011
Oh, wow.

536
00:31:49,089 --> 00:31:51,557
- You know her really well.
- I know her pretty well.

537
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:55,584
Um, she... she came
to see me a couple of weeks ago.

538
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,688
- And...
- A couple of weeks ago?

539
00:31:57,765 --> 00:32:00,825
Yeah.
I... I didn't know what to say to her.

540
00:32:00,901 --> 00:32:04,564
She looks so much...
so much like her mother.

541
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:07,471
Ellis was cold.

542
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:10,374
I mean, I was a coward.
I was... I... I left.

543
00:32:11,645 --> 00:32:15,046
But her mother would never
let me know her and...

544
00:32:15,115 --> 00:32:19,051
now I don't know how to know her. Uh...

545
00:32:24,191 --> 00:32:26,386
Well, Meredith is anything but cold.

546
00:32:27,428 --> 00:32:32,195
She smiles.
Not that often, but when she does, uh...

547
00:32:32,266 --> 00:32:34,894
you know, because she's been
going through a lot...

548
00:32:34,968 --> 00:32:40,031
but... it's... it's like you feel warm.

549
00:32:41,008 --> 00:32:42,532
She's kind.

550
00:32:42,609 --> 00:32:44,577
I mean, she can be a little selfish.

551
00:32:44,645 --> 00:32:46,840
She can be...

552
00:32:46,914 --> 00:32:49,144
She's flawed, but she's kind.

553
00:32:49,983 --> 00:32:52,213
She cares about people.

554
00:32:52,286 --> 00:32:55,722
And, uh, she cares about...

555
00:32:55,789 --> 00:32:57,381
about her patients.

556
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:59,983
I think she's going to be
a brilliant surgeon.

557
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:03,791
You know, around here,
she's known as the one to beat.

558
00:33:03,864 --> 00:33:07,732
So, I... I mean, I guess she has that
in common with her mom,

559
00:33:07,801 --> 00:33:11,862
but... I think the rest of her...

560
00:33:11,939 --> 00:33:14,840
I think, uh, I think the rest of that
she gets from you.

561
00:33:18,278 --> 00:33:21,679
Do... Do you know... where she is?

562
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,546
I think she left already.

563
00:33:23,617 --> 00:33:26,518
But I could tell her you were here,
if you want me to?

564
00:33:28,322 --> 00:33:32,418
Yeah. OK. Thank you.

565
00:33:32,493 --> 00:33:33,983
OK.

566
00:33:34,061 --> 00:33:35,619
- OK.
- OK. Bye.

567
00:33:35,696 --> 00:33:37,027
Yeah.

568
00:33:42,436 --> 00:33:44,427
Thank you, George.

569
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,747
<i>The hernia is causing
the baby's abdominal...</i>

570
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:57,545
- Hey.
- Hey, still knitting?

571
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:00,416
Oh, yeah. I'm getting so good at it.

572
00:34:00,487 --> 00:34:04,583
Hmm. I did a craniotomy on a kid today
while he was awake.

573
00:34:04,658 --> 00:34:06,717
I met a sister I never knew I had.

574
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,763
And I saw my father which was, uh...

575
00:34:12,132 --> 00:34:15,499
- I don't know what it was.
- Hmm. You OK?

576
00:34:17,171 --> 00:34:19,196
I have my knitting.

577
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,939
Study hard, keep your grades up.

578
00:34:27,014 --> 00:34:31,212
But starting next year you're going to
want to take two AP classes a semester

579
00:34:31,285 --> 00:34:33,549
if you want to get into
a decent college.

580
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,679
Mom, this is really morbid.

581
00:34:35,756 --> 00:34:39,248
And your Aunt Sue is kind of lazy
when it comes to personal hygiene

582
00:34:39,326 --> 00:34:42,318
so you may have to be
the one to remind her

583
00:34:42,396 --> 00:34:45,456
when it's time to get your eyebrows
waxed or get your hair cut,

584
00:34:45,532 --> 00:34:48,194
but eventually
she'll get the routine down.

585
00:34:48,268 --> 00:34:50,259
Can we not have this conversation?

586
00:34:50,337 --> 00:34:55,138
This might sound random,
but wear underwear with pantyhose.

587
00:34:55,209 --> 00:34:57,871
I know it might feel a little bulky,

588
00:34:57,945 --> 00:35:00,573
but honestly,
it's a little slutty not to

589
00:35:00,647 --> 00:35:02,911
and also that's
how you get yeast infections.

590
00:35:02,983 --> 00:35:05,349
Mom, this is totally gross.

591
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:09,719
And marry a kind man.
One who's nice to his mother.

592
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:13,123
Now, if he lives with his mother,
you run the opposite way.

593
00:35:13,193 --> 00:35:17,687
Mom, I'm not
getting married any time soon.

594
00:35:17,764 --> 00:35:19,459
You will someday.

595
00:35:19,533 --> 00:35:21,728
And when that day comes,

596
00:35:21,802 --> 00:35:24,896
just have one glass of champagne

597
00:35:24,972 --> 00:35:27,304
and then you drink water
for the rest of the night

598
00:35:27,374 --> 00:35:30,537
because there's nothing tackier
than a drunken bride.

599
00:35:30,611 --> 00:35:33,774
Mom, I don't want to...

600
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:39,648
Why are you telling me all this?

601
00:35:43,357 --> 00:35:45,348
Honey, I've been sick for a long time

602
00:35:45,425 --> 00:35:48,485
and the doctors don't think
that I'm going to get better.

603
00:35:50,163 --> 00:35:51,687
No.

604
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,893
Amelia. Listen to me.

605
00:35:55,969 --> 00:35:58,199
Look at me. Amelia.

606
00:35:59,139 --> 00:36:01,107
This is important.

607
00:36:01,174 --> 00:36:04,041
This one is...
is really the important one.

608
00:36:05,112 --> 00:36:08,013
Someday you're going to have a baby.

609
00:36:08,081 --> 00:36:12,609
And you're going to feel overwhelmed by
this little life you're responsible for.

610
00:36:12,686 --> 00:36:16,679
And you're going to think...
worry everything you do is wrong.

611
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,190
And that's normal.

612
00:36:18,258 --> 00:36:20,692
You're going to obsess about
what to feed it

613
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,786
and where to send it to school

614
00:36:22,863 --> 00:36:26,128
and whether it should
take violin or piano.

615
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,466
But I'm going to let you in
on a little secret.

616
00:36:29,536 --> 00:36:31,527
It doesn't matter.

617
00:36:32,306 --> 00:36:37,869
Whether your kid is a concert pianist
or a math genius, it just doesn't matter

618
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:41,938
because at the end of the day, all that
matters is if your kid is happy.

619
00:36:42,015 --> 00:36:45,644
So you're going to feel sad...
for a little while.

620
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,555
And that's OK. That's... That's fine.

621
00:36:49,623 --> 00:36:53,081
But don't feel sad forever. OK?

622
00:36:54,027 --> 00:36:57,622
You can promise me that? You promise me
that you won't feel sad for too long?

623
00:36:57,698 --> 00:37:00,565
- I promise.
- OK. Thank you.

624
00:37:00,634 --> 00:37:03,034
You make me feel much better.

625
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:11,811
<i>Life is not a spectator sport.</i>

626
00:37:13,246 --> 00:37:15,407
<i>Win, lose or draw...</i>

627
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:19,115
<i>the game is in progress...</i>

628
00:37:20,687 --> 00:37:23,383
<i>whether we want it to be or not.</i>

629
00:37:23,457 --> 00:37:24,856
Ta-dah!

630
00:37:25,459 --> 00:37:27,324
You made me a sweater.

631
00:37:27,394 --> 00:37:30,158
Today. In one day,
you made me a sweater?

632
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:32,994
Yeah, well, you know.
I just had some time, so...

633
00:37:33,066 --> 00:37:35,796
That vow of celibacy
must really be something.

634
00:37:37,037 --> 00:37:39,801
You know what?
Just accept your gift and say thank you.

635
00:37:39,873 --> 00:37:42,637
Does this mean
I don't get any sexual favors?

636
00:37:42,709 --> 00:37:44,836
Sweater instead of sex?

637
00:37:44,911 --> 00:37:48,176
Smell it. Go on, smell it.

638
00:37:52,886 --> 00:37:55,184
It smells like Izzie.

639
00:37:55,255 --> 00:37:57,485
Yeah, I wore it for three hours.

640
00:37:57,557 --> 00:38:00,958
So that is the closest you're going
to be getting to this body, mister.

641
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,553
You want to play some Scrabble
or you too tired?

642
00:38:04,264 --> 00:38:06,255
Scrabble, please.

643
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:07,664
OK.

644
00:38:08,835 --> 00:38:11,531
Just show me one boob.

645
00:38:17,844 --> 00:38:20,677
- Sir.
- Nice work today, Yang.

646
00:38:21,448 --> 00:38:25,111
Hopefully your fellow interns
will be as adept on the scope as you.

647
00:38:25,185 --> 00:38:27,847
Thank you, sir,
but, um, you weren't even looking.

648
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,519
You actually had your eyes closed.

649
00:38:31,591 --> 00:38:35,823
So, how... I was watching you
and... and you didn't even need the...

650
00:38:37,531 --> 00:38:41,661
You didn't even need the screen
to help you guide the needle holder.

651
00:38:41,735 --> 00:38:43,498
Old school, Yang.

652
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,561
Muscle memory.

653
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:50,669
You want to win,
always go back to the basics.

654
00:38:54,715 --> 00:38:56,842
It's my move?

655
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,624
Cristina, what the hell are you doing?

656
00:39:05,692 --> 00:39:10,527
Oh.
Um... being comfortable in my apartment.

657
00:39:10,597 --> 00:39:14,055
I didn't see anything!
Dude, I did not see anything!

658
00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:17,298
Get out.

659
00:39:19,873 --> 00:39:21,500
Basics.

660
00:39:21,575 --> 00:39:23,338
<i>So go ahead:</i>

661
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:26,902
<i>Argue with the refs, change the rules...</i>

662
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,381
<i>cheat a little...</i>

663
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:34,143
<i>take a break...
and tend to your wounds.</i>

664
00:39:41,561 --> 00:39:43,552
<i>But play.</i>

665
00:39:53,306 --> 00:39:55,536
Hello?

666
00:39:57,644 --> 00:39:59,635
<i>Play.</i>

667
00:40:01,848 --> 00:40:05,147
- Hi.
- Um, hey.

668
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,886
- Um...
- You live here?

669
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:11,687
Yeah.

670
00:40:11,758 --> 00:40:16,024
I'm not... crazy or anything.

671
00:40:16,096 --> 00:40:18,462
I just spend so much time here
in the hospital.

672
00:40:21,868 --> 00:40:24,359
It's just... It's easier.

673
00:40:24,437 --> 00:40:26,268
So...

674
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,301
I'm not... I'm not crazy or anything.

675
00:40:34,147 --> 00:40:36,047
Do you know how to cut hair?

676
00:40:43,757 --> 00:40:45,281
<i>Play hard.</i>

677
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:47,349
<i>Play fast.</i>

678
00:40:51,097 --> 00:40:53,361
<i>Play loose and free.</i>

679
00:41:12,018 --> 00:41:16,045
<i>Play as if there's no tomorrow.</i>

680
00:41:16,122 --> 00:41:17,714
Come on.

681
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:20,123
Dandridge's Veterinary Clinic.

682
00:41:20,193 --> 00:41:22,354
We certainly do.

683
00:41:22,429 --> 00:41:23,862
Yes.

684
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,795
Thank you.

685
00:41:29,002 --> 00:41:31,095
You getting the hang of it?

686
00:41:31,171 --> 00:41:32,866
Not really.

687
00:41:32,939 --> 00:41:35,100
You give up men?

688
00:41:36,009 --> 00:41:37,567
No.

689
00:41:37,644 --> 00:41:39,373
Yes.

690
00:41:41,314 --> 00:41:43,305
I don't actually need to see the vet.

691
00:41:43,383 --> 00:41:47,183
I really just wanted to sit with Doc.
I just want to spend time with my dog.

692
00:41:55,195 --> 00:41:57,629
Hi. I'm Finn Dandridge. I'm Doc's vet.

693
00:41:57,697 --> 00:42:01,793
And you are Dr. Grey. Doc's other owner.

694
00:42:01,868 --> 00:42:03,563
We finally meet.

695
00:42:03,637 --> 00:42:05,468
Hello.

696
00:42:05,538 --> 00:42:09,998
<i>OK, so it's not
whether you win or lose...</i>

697
00:42:10,076 --> 00:42:12,340
<i>it's how you play the game.</i>

698
00:42:14,781 --> 00:42:16,749
<i>Right?</i>
