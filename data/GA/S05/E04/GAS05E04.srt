00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:04,189
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:04,221 --> 00:00:05,632
I had a bad night, I cried. I'm
over it. You need to get over it.

3
00:00:05,656 --> 00:00:07,496
I'm retaking my intern test.

4
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,802
You and I are more
than just roommates.

5
00:00:09,826 --> 00:00:12,478
We're friends. You're
probably one of my best friends.

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,679
Best friend.

7
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:16,382
You're the only
woman I've ever kissed.

8
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:19,334
- You're freaking out, too?
- A lot of therapy time.

9
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:23,672
Derek's moved in. We've taken
it to the next level. I am happy.

10
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:33,098
<i>In 6500 BC, some guy
looked at his sick friend</i>

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,966
<i>and said, "I have an idea.</i>

12
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:38,703
<i>Why don't I drill a hole in your
skull? It'll make you feel better."</i>

13
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,639
<i>Thus surgery was born.</i>

14
00:00:43,393 --> 00:00:45,627
- Hey.
- Uh...

15
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:47,466
- Where's Mer?
- She's not here.

16
00:00:47,498 --> 00:00:49,181
Oh!

17
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:51,316
So you're just in
there by yourself?

18
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:54,719
I'm not... I'm waiting for her.

19
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,038
- Love the outfit.
- What do you want?

20
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,176
I need cash. I ordered a pizza
and Alex owes me 20 bucks,

21
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:04,212
but he's not speaking to
me because I saw him crying

22
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,947
over his crazy girlfriend,

23
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,634
and there was a minute, a week
ago, I thought he'd be a human being,

24
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:13,021
- and now he won't
open the door.
- Run into the bathroom.

25
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:14,573
Just go. Go!

26
00:01:15,225 --> 00:01:18,494
Karev! Give me a 20.

27
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:22,313
Thank you.

28
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:27,252
That was so awesome. Very cool.

29
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:30,689
Not that I didn't think you
were cool before, but I did not.

30
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,358
I just thought you were
all hair and, you know...

31
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,345
Now cool. You want
to share some pizza?

32
00:01:37,748 --> 00:01:39,848
<i>It takes a certain
brand of crazy</i>

33
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,084
<i>to come up with an idea like
drilling into somebody's skull,</i>

34
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,987
<i>but surgeons have always
been a confident bunch.</i>

35
00:01:46,089 --> 00:01:47,456
Your clothes, your room.

36
00:01:47,558 --> 00:01:51,092
The living room will not be a
dumping ground like the old place.

37
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,296
Did you not hear her?

38
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:00,769
OK. She kind of scares me.

39
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:04,439
'Cause she's scary. Callie
needs a new best friend.

40
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:09,011
- Not bad, right?
- It's great.

41
00:02:09,113 --> 00:02:12,947
<i>We usually know what we're doing.
When we don't, we act like we do.</i>

42
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:16,134
<i>We walk boldly into
undiscovered country, plant a flag,</i>

43
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:17,970
<i>start ordering people around.</i>

44
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:22,040
- Want to go on a date with me?
- <i>It's invigorating</i>
<i>and terrifying.</i>

45
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,475
Like a date date?

46
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:27,478
Yeah, restaurant,
candlelight, bottle of wine.

47
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,298
At the end of the night I
try to take your clothes off.

48
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,752
OK. That would be a date.

49
00:02:41,712 --> 00:02:43,311
- Hey.
- Hey.

50
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,548
- You're...
- Naked and waiting
for you.

51
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:54,523
You keep a diary? Have I not known,
all this time, that you keep a diary?

52
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,975
- No. I... I don't...
- Aw!

53
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:59,055
Don't be shy. I think it's cute.

54
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,513
- It's not mine.
- I won't read it.

55
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:06,034
- Whose is it?
- Your mother's.

56
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:13,975
It was in a big box full of old issues of<i>
The New England Journal of Medicine.</i>

57
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:16,828
- Did you read it?
- No.

58
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:19,031
I brought it up here for you.

59
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:21,544
Why were you going
through her things?

60
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,002
Trying to find
space for my clothes.

61
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,938
Your closet is full.

62
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:35,396
I have to shower. I've been
hauling Cristina's boxes.

63
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,407
- You haven't read any?
- No. What if I'm in it?

64
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:48,677
I don't want to hear
what she thought of me.

65
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:51,847
- What's worse,
if you're in it or not?
- I don't know!

66
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:56,451
I mean, see, why is he in the
study rooting around in closets

67
00:03:56,553 --> 00:03:58,703
trying to dig up
my mother's ghost?

68
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,817
I think 'cause you invited him.

69
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,858
Apparently some people
thought I was kidding last week

70
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,079
when I announced nobody was going
to hang out on their favorite specialty.

71
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:12,317
I wasn't. Junior
residents don't specialize,

72
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,687
so all the requests to
send you back to that place

73
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:18,140
where your true heart
lives can end now.

74
00:04:18,242 --> 00:04:20,292
Dr. Bailey makes
the assignments.

75
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:23,561
Do not, and I repeat,
do not harangue her.

76
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:30,568
O'Malley, I made a call.

77
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,989
They don't have your score
yet. If I knew, I would tell you.

78
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,560
Hey.

79
00:04:39,662 --> 00:04:44,165
You passed. We're gonna go to Joe's
tonight, and we're gonna celebrate.

80
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:47,602
I'm gonna buy you a beer
and all the peanuts you can eat.

81
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,704
What if I didn't pass?

82
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:52,286
Well, then I'm still
buying you a beer.

83
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,475
Beer for losers.

84
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:56,611
Grey, you're on
cardio with Hahn today.

85
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,713
- But...
- Stevens and Karev, pit.

86
00:04:58,815 --> 00:05:01,466
- Come on!
- Chief wants us
to have a change.

87
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:04,519
That's not a change. I'm
always stuck in the pit with Alex.

88
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:07,972
When the Chief said, "Don't harangue
Dr. Bailey," what do you think he meant?

89
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,142
- Yang, clinic.
- What? No. No!

90
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:13,294
No, wait. The clinic is
mine. I say how it's staffed.

91
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,024
- She'll ruin it.
- I'll ruin it.

92
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,899
- Just let me do it.
- You will not. You will do what I say.

93
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:21,314
Since Yang couldn't be bothered to
show up at the clinic since it opened,

94
00:05:21,338 --> 00:05:24,256
think of it as a new
frontier in her training.

95
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:25,640
Sorry.

96
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,476
You're not sorry. You're
psyched you got Hahn.

97
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,912
- If not, you should be.
- She's terrifying.

98
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:34,932
You give her unrealistic expectations
as to what a resident should be.

99
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:38,436
Stay on top of the material. Don't
get warm and fuzzy. She hates that.

100
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,172
Any questions, come and ask me.

101
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,075
I'll be in the clinic putting
Band-Aids on whiners

102
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:46,878
who don't have the balls to get
real injuries. Let's go. Come on.

103
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,946
Here you go.

104
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:52,529
I didn't read the diary. I just
found it and put it on the table.

105
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:53,835
I would've read it.

106
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,937
Every time I
actually do something

107
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,507
to move into the
house, she freaks out.

108
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:02,377
What are you gonna
do with the trailer?

109
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,429
- No.
- Come on.

110
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:08,299
Plus, there's a real possibility,
she kicks me out in a week.

111
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,986
I'm not letting
go of the trailer.

112
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:13,369
Sutures, fecal impaction
and more sutures.

113
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,391
- She'll do it.
- What do you mean
"She'll do it?"

114
00:06:16,493 --> 00:06:20,212
You're good at boring, stupid
crap. You're like a specialist.

115
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,568
Hi, I'm Dr. Stevens. Looks
like you need some stitches.

116
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,603
- What happened?
- I have a cut.

117
00:06:28,705 --> 00:06:32,674
- How'd you get it?
- I threw a remote
at him, OK?

118
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:36,094
All he can do is watch television
or fall asleep like a dead person.

119
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:38,897
- Honey.
- Don't "honey" me. I'm divorcing you.

120
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,634
Soon as you stop bleeding from
your head we're going to a lawyer.

121
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,449
- Ever been to Europe?
- Nope. Someday.

122
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:51,009
Don't wait until you're retired. Can't
be bothered to look out the window.

123
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,978
Six-month trip across the world.

124
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,797
I've been waiting for it for 15 years.
He slept through the whole thing.

125
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,050
- Marianne.
- Six continents.

126
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,070
I worked for 30
years. I was very tired.

127
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,156
Well, I'm tired, too, of
being married to somebody

128
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,226
with no interest in the
world, so everybody's tired.

129
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:11,212
I'm going to get coffee. I
assume this'll take forever?

130
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:12,814
Probably.

131
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:23,908
Your mouth always do that,
move to the side like that?

132
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,476
Like what?

133
00:07:26,796 --> 00:07:30,232
- Mind if I run some tests?
- Whatever you want.

134
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:31,583
Great.

135
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:36,588
I may be wrong, but I think
Mr. Grandy has a neuro thing going on.

136
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,623
Get him stitched
up then up for a CT.

137
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:39,925
OK.

138
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:43,578
Give me that. Give it!

139
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:51,152
Mr. Grandy. I'm Dr. Karev, and I
will be taking you up for your CT today.

140
00:07:51,254 --> 00:07:54,972
Duncan Paley, eight, recently
diagnosed with aortic valve disease

141
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:58,443
from infectious endocarditis,
scheduled for a Ross procedure.

142
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:01,156
- There's a note from his pediatrician.
- - Duncan!

143
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,597
- Duncan, get back here!
- Duncan!

144
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:09,554
- Go!
- Sure.

145
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:14,776
- Sorry. Duncan.
- Duncan! Duncan,
come back here.

146
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:18,613
- Duncan, you get down
from there.
- Don't touch the fire alarm.

147
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:20,782
I'm not having the surgery. No!

148
00:08:20,884 --> 00:08:22,917
- Come on, get down.
- I'm not doing it!

149
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,819
- One, two, three...
- No!

150
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,354
I think this is all going
to be OK if we just...

151
00:08:27,457 --> 00:08:29,523
Will you promise me no surgery?

152
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,694
Promise me no surgery.

153
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:39,584
I... We... We
can't really do that.

154
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:44,372
<i>Evacuate. Evacuate.</i>

155
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:48,994
<i>Evacuate. This is an emergency.</i>

156
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:59,103
Do we have this kid under control,
or do I have to call Social Services?

157
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,973
- He won't do anything
like that again.
- He better not.

158
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:05,676
The ceiling fell last week. I don't
need a series of false alarms.

159
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,062
This place looks
ridiculous enough.

160
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:11,382
- Keep the ankle-biter
under control.
- I'll sedate him if I have to.

161
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,863
Good. Bone up on your
pulmonary autografts.

162
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:18,823
I don't want to spend the day bathed
in your ignorance and incompetence.

163
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,926
- She hates me.
- What do you mean
"we'll sedate him?"

164
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,190
I was trying not to
be warm and fuzzy.

165
00:09:24,214 --> 00:09:26,614
I don't mean sedate
him, I mean baby-sit him.

166
00:09:26,683 --> 00:09:31,452
It's your last day as an intern. Think
of how happy you'll be to move on.

167
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:35,156
Hey.

168
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:37,378
I'm gonna be in
the OR until 7:00.

169
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,804
Is 8:00 too late for dinner?

170
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,195
No, but if you need to
reschedule or cancel.

171
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:44,950
Come on, are you kidding? I
made a reservation at Canto.

172
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:47,285
I even gamed out an outfit.

173
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:50,471
We are doing this.

174
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:56,411
So Hahn is doing a Ross
procedure, and she thinks I'm a moron.

175
00:09:56,513 --> 00:10:00,248
It's called a pulmonary autograft.
She likes the technical names, OK?

176
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,851
Tell her you're excited to watch
her harvest a pulmonary valve

177
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:05,999
using her septal
sparing technique.

178
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:09,690
Cut too much of the septal muscle, the
patient won't be able to come off pump.

179
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,259
- None of that is in the book.
- The key to the case.

180
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,740
You'll sound like you've
been around the block.

181
00:10:14,764 --> 00:10:17,426
I can't believe I'm
giving you my best stuff.

182
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,533
- Mwah!
- You don't deserve it.

183
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:23,938
Dr. Yang, Mrs. Borsokowski
needs your loving attention.

184
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,675
Redness, itching, inflammation:
A rash. You're giving me a rash.

185
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:30,829
No! She's the mean
one! I don't want her.

186
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,383
OK.

187
00:10:35,485 --> 00:10:37,685
- All right, what do we got?
- Take a look.

188
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:39,120
Thing's bigger than a baseball.

189
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,662
Oh, wow, it's right
behind his eyes.

190
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,752
This'll be fun. Page Stevens.

191
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,744
She left the guy with me.

192
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:50,497
- She gave you the case?
- Yeah, well, Izzie
felt bad for me.

193
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,333
Figured this would cheer me up.

194
00:10:52,435 --> 00:10:55,286
In that case you'll help
me pull this thing out.

195
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,872
Hey, Duncan.

196
00:10:57,974 --> 00:11:01,809
We're gonna put an IV in your arm
real quick, then you can go on playing.

197
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,629
- What is it?
- A little tube
we put in your arm.

198
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,498
No. No, it's gonna hurt.

199
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,617
- Come on,
it's not gonna hurt.
- It's gonna hurt.

200
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:15,340
It's a needle, it's gonna hurt. But
it's only for, what, three seconds?

201
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:18,058
- I don't believe you.
- You don't believe me?

202
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:20,662
Do you want me to
prove it to you? I'll prove it.

203
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,530
I'll have Dr. Grey
put one in me.

204
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:25,416
This is a tourniquet.

205
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:30,805
And you wrap it around your
arm so that your vein pops out.

206
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:32,657
See? Like that.

207
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,293
So now, the needle.

208
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,345
That's the part
that's gonna hurt.

209
00:11:38,148 --> 00:11:41,215
That goes in, and that's in...

210
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:47,671
Hurting. That
hurts, it hurts, and...

211
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,508
It doesn't hurt anymore.

212
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:55,580
Now that stuff, it goes
into here. Doesn't hurt at all.

213
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,483
OK, I'll do it.

214
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:07,057
- OK. I'll go get
another IV kit.
- OK.

215
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:10,211
Wow. You're really good at this.

216
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,847
Oh, I was an airplane
guy too when I was his age.

217
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:16,167
Us airplane guys, we like
to know how things work.

218
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,691
I'm sorry about the alarm.

219
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,859
I know.

220
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:31,199
Move!

221
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:35,236
They have the
nerve to be indignant

222
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:38,405
about how they're not allowed
to be on their specialties.

223
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:42,744
They don't have specialties. They should
be grateful they're allowed in the...

224
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,729
Are you listening to me?

225
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:52,053
I'm going on a date with Erica
Hahn and, uh... that's awkward

226
00:12:52,155 --> 00:12:54,922
'cause, uh... she's a colleague

227
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:59,561
and because she's an attending,
and because she's a she.

228
00:12:59,663 --> 00:13:03,665
And, uh, there's been
kissing, but, uh... no touching,

229
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:06,934
and what if I'm not into
it? What if I'm horrible

230
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:12,073
at all that stuff
south... of the border?

231
00:13:12,175 --> 00:13:14,809
'Cause I've never been
south of the border...

232
00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:16,211
with a female.

233
00:13:16,313 --> 00:13:20,130
I mean, I've never even been
over the northern mountains,

234
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,033
you know what I'm sayin'?

235
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:30,441
We're gonna pretend
this didn't happen.

236
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,381
Mr. Grandy?

237
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,552
- What are you doing in here?
- They admitted me.

238
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:45,556
My new doctor, Dr. Karev, said
I have a huge tumor in my head.

239
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,075
Have you seen my wife?

240
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:50,912
Your new doctor?

241
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:53,831
Somebody page me?

242
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,467
I have a patient with
tenderness and erythema

243
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,535
from her upper
chest to her left arm.

244
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,738
She needs irrigation
and debridement.

245
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,024
She said you may have
to amputate my arm.

246
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:06,961
It's a simple rash. It's
probably dermatitis.

247
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:10,381
But look how the skin is
denuded. Could be surgical, right?

248
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:13,267
It's a rash. Go to Derm,
get a tube of CeraVe cream.

249
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:16,837
Don't ever page me to
hustle a surgery again.

250
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,907
It was supposed to be
done yesterday. Done!

251
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:22,042
So exactly why did
I walk into my OR

252
00:14:22,145 --> 00:14:26,079
and still see a massive, gaping hole
where the ceiling was supposed to be?

253
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:29,917
You see Karev, get an 18-gauge
needle and shove it in his throat.

254
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,554
I have cultivated a look that says I'm
not interested in personal problems.

255
00:14:33,657 --> 00:14:35,456
Can you morons
not read that look,

256
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:38,292
or have I lost the hang of it?
People are telling me problems!

257
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:42,030
I don't give a crap about your
crushing workload or love life

258
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,781
or your carpal tunnel syndrome.

259
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,818
I care about is Mrs. Caruchi, a
92-year-old woman no one can find!

260
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:52,790
Hi.

261
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,009
I'm Dr. Pepman. Can I help you?

262
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:57,045
Uh, yeah, um...

263
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,530
Where can I get
some CeraVe cream?

264
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:02,800
Um, our nurses look
like they're tied up.

265
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,336
If you don't mind waiting
I can get it for you myself.

266
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:10,041
- Water with raspberries
while you wait?
- Uh, sure.

267
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,396
Hi, Chris.

268
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,402
Oh. Don't mind Chris.
He's our massage therapist.

269
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,871
You're... a what?

270
00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:27,709
Our hands do such delicate work.
It's important they stay healthy.

271
00:15:27,811 --> 00:15:31,412
We have Chris on staff to work on
us when we have a spare moment.

272
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:36,084
Every attending gets their
hands massaged at work?

273
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:39,587
Oh, no. The dermatology
attendings have another therapist.

274
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,089
Chris just works
on the residents.

275
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:47,428
- You're a resident?
- First year, and loving it.

276
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,552
So I'll make an incision ear
to ear and peel down the face.

277
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:58,873
I'll crack open his forehead,
pull the tumor right out.

278
00:15:58,974 --> 00:16:02,677
Keep an eye on the optic nerve.
Somebody twitches and this guy's blind.

279
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:05,029
Which one of your
roommates will be assisting?

280
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:09,049
- Karev.
- Oh, great.

281
00:16:09,151 --> 00:16:12,319
Dr. Shepherd, I want back
on this case. This is my patient.

282
00:16:12,422 --> 00:16:15,773
- Alex stole him from me...
- Dr. Stevens, in this hospital

283
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:19,192
I'm not your roommate. I don't
give a crap about your problems.

284
00:16:19,295 --> 00:16:21,229
I have a resident. I
don't need another.

285
00:16:21,331 --> 00:16:25,282
The patient's in his room, if
you want to go over procedure.

286
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:30,304
- Son of a bitch.
- Go cry to somebody
who cares.

287
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,042
This is my case. It isn't fair.

288
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:37,328
Surgery's like the Wild West.

289
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,064
You didn't get your claim
in Montana from the bank,

290
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:45,085
you got it 'cause you put a fence and
shot the ass off anyone who walked by.

291
00:16:45,187 --> 00:16:48,121
Karev's a cowboy. You're not.

292
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:55,212
We're gonna transect the great
arteries at the sinotubular ridge,

293
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:59,700
use the autograft to replace the aortic
root, then attach a pulmonary homograft.

294
00:16:59,803 --> 00:17:03,838
You going to use septal sparing
technique for the pulmonary autograft?

295
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,940
Yes. Why do you ask?

296
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:09,593
If we cut too much of the septal muscle
we can't take the patient off the pump?

297
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,978
Right.

298
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,013
Always wanted to see a
septal sparing technique.

299
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,595
Know how to reanastomose the
coronary arteries back to the aorta?

300
00:17:16,652 --> 00:17:18,519
I do.

301
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,216
I'll let you sew part of it in.

302
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,368
You'll be in there, might
as well get your hands dirty.

303
00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:26,127
Great. Thanks, Dr. Hahn.

304
00:17:26,229 --> 00:17:28,379
You're going to hell
'cause you're a liar.

305
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:31,616
- Was it obvious?
- Unfortunately, no.

306
00:17:38,174 --> 00:17:41,843
<i>♪ My love, let me go again ♪</i>

307
00:17:41,945 --> 00:17:46,046

What?

312
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,951
- What happened?
- Look.

313
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,304
You paged me 911.

314
00:18:10,406 --> 00:18:14,225
I'm in the middle of studying
for Hahn's pulmonary autograft...

315
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:19,664
They're residents.

316
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:24,668
That one baked a seven-layer cake
for that one's birthday, from scratch.

317
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,173
And that one, that one's girlfriend
is taking him skiing this weekend.

318
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,574
Oh, this one's the best.

319
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:34,027
OK, this one gets to
leave to go get a facial.

320
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:37,081
And she told her attending.
And her attending was happy

321
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:40,067
'cause they have to have
facials. They're dermatologists.

322
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:44,322
- I mean, look... look...
- Oh, my God.

323
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:48,926
The hospital has hired
someone to rub them, full-time.

324
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:53,281
I bet their boyfriends don't go digging
around in their closets without asking.

325
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,982
Never.

326
00:18:55,084 --> 00:18:58,752
I told Hahn I knew how to do a
coronary artery reanastomosis.

327
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,106
- You don't.
- I know.

328
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,421
I looked it up, the kid's
eight. He's got tiny arteries.

329
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:08,946
Know what? Snag me some of
those grapes there, I'll teach you.

330
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:10,748
And then find Dr. Daisy Pepman.

331
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,351
Ask her for a suture kit
and a 7-0 polypropylene.

332
00:19:13,436 --> 00:19:16,187
- Dr. Daisy Pepman?
- She's a resident.

333
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:18,121
She pours fruity drinks.

334
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:21,692
She has time for that kind of
thing. And I like saying her name.

335
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:24,779
So was that hyphenated or
did her parents name her...?

336
00:19:24,881 --> 00:19:26,963
No... No mocking.

337
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:31,685
There is no mocking in
Derm. Only warmth and light.

338
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:37,624
Are you all right, Mrs. Paley?

339
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:39,571
You want to know
what Duncan's doing?

340
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:43,764
Packing to leave,
and I can't stop him.

341
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,083
I suck at this.

342
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:50,787
I'm tired and I'm fried because I lie
awake at night listening to him breathe

343
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,370
because I'm afraid his heart's
gonna stop, and he's gonna die,

344
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:57,761
and I'll have been sleeping.
I don't know how to do this.

345
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,714
No one knows how to be the
mom of a kid with heart failure.

346
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:02,316
Nobody teaches that.

347
00:20:02,418 --> 00:20:05,219
And you have a really
smart kid, you know that.

348
00:20:06,555 --> 00:20:08,923
We just need to up
our game a little bit.

349
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:13,077
- Can I try?
- Go for it.

350
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:21,352
- A baseball?
- Which is why you were
so lethargic.

351
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:25,489
Why I slept through
most of our trip, perhaps.

352
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:28,592
Not because I am
boring and uninterested

353
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,478
- in the cultures of the world.
- How was I supposed to know?

354
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:34,493
You were supposed to give
me the benefit of the doubt,

355
00:20:34,517 --> 00:20:36,683
not throw electronics at me.

356
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:40,804
Mr. Grandy, this is a massive tumor
in an area that's very hard to reach.

357
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,724
You're gonna want to talk
about this with your wife.

358
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,293
- I'm sure she's fine
with the risks.
- Arnie.

359
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:50,364
I'm going through with
it. I got nothing left to lose.

360
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,700
See you in the OR.

361
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,365
Dr. Shepherd,
that is my patient.

362
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:58,601
I'm sure you can
use another resident...

363
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,591
I am not the traffic
cop on the playground.

364
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:04,595
It's the Wild West and you're the
sheriff. Can't you be the sheriff?

365
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,308
I'll think of you when we
crack his forehead open.

366
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:08,999
I'm not letting you do this
to me. Do not walk away.

367
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,952
Give me back my surgery
or I'll shoot your ass off!

368
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,150
He stole a very big surgery.

369
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:30,854
I'll pick it up.

370
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:36,960
- What'd you do
with the diary?
- It's in my locker.

371
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,746
Do you want me
to screen it for you?

372
00:21:38,848 --> 00:21:43,250
- Magic Marker out
all the scary parts.
- No. No one's reading it.

373
00:21:43,352 --> 00:21:44,802
OK, no. Don't. Here...

374
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:47,921
Don't pull too hard.
You're stretching the skin.

375
00:21:48,023 --> 00:21:51,387
Alex stole my patient with a
grapefruit growing behind his eyes.

376
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:53,572
Your boyfriend
couldn't give a crap.

377
00:21:53,596 --> 00:21:56,296
He actually said the
words, "I don't give a crap."

378
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,282
See that guy there,
OK? He's a resident.

379
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:03,737
He's dragging 'cause he got too much
sleep last night. Uh-huh. Too much.

380
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:06,840
- What?
- Like watching
a living freak show.

381
00:22:15,718 --> 00:22:17,234
I don't talk about sex.

382
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,549
Please, let's just pretend I
never said even a single word.

383
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:24,275
I don't talk about sex with
anyone ever, not any kind of sex.

384
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:28,095
- Bailey, I am begging you...
- Uh!

385
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:39,623
The vajayjay is
undiscovered country.

386
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:42,409
It is the motherland.

387
00:22:42,511 --> 00:22:48,131
You've never traveled there, you
don't know its customs and ways.

388
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:51,085
Now me, I've always
wanted to go to Africa.

389
00:22:51,186 --> 00:22:54,872
But, if I go, I'm gonna have
to learn a few things first.

390
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:56,807
I'm going to have to prepare.

391
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:59,043
I'll need shots.

392
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:02,312
Bring my own syringes in
case something goes wrong.

393
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:04,948
And I'll want to know how
to get to the embassy...

394
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,483
OK, now you've lost me.

395
00:23:09,939 --> 00:23:12,156
Just talk about it.

396
00:23:13,609 --> 00:23:15,626
Not with me, with the other one.

397
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:19,563
Just talk about the
rules, the expectations,

398
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:22,499
figure out how to
gracefully demur

399
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:26,954
if you find you don't
like... the local cuisine.

400
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:32,909
In Ethiopia, they eat stew

401
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:36,447
off of spongy sour bread.

402
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,384
That's not for everyone.

403
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:43,470
<i>♪ Your head up high,
like you think I do ♪</i>

404
00:23:43,572 --> 00:23:46,824
<i>♪ Doo-doo-doo
doo-doo doo-doo-doo ♪</i>

405
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:52,429
<i>♪ Sometimes I feel so confused ♪</i>

406
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:54,998
<i>♪ I'm under the illusion... ♪</i>

407
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,501
- Mer, I need you!
- Shh!

408
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,788
- Harshing the vibe.
- What are you doing?

409
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,792
Cristina found this magical
world where doctors are happy

410
00:24:04,894 --> 00:24:10,447
and patients are pleasant, and no
one is screaming or stealing surgeries.

411
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:13,416
Everyone just rubs
each other all day long.

412
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,037
You all want to be dermatologists?
They apply lotion for a living.

413
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:21,091
Yeah. That's the point.
Come here, come here.

414
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:26,864
They're empty inside,
completely devoid of blood lust.

415
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:30,801
They don't need to fight for anything.
They don't want to cut anyone open.

416
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:33,887
They just... love lotion.

417
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:38,792
Do you know how much easier our
life would be if we could just love lotion?

418
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,734
How do you think
they got that way?

419
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:45,582
Their mothers didn't leave
diaries around for them to read.

420
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:49,970
Sloan told me today to stake
my claim in the Wild Wild West,

421
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:54,975
so I went all cowboy on Alex's
ass and I still don't have my surgery.

422
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:58,779
These women, they do
not have to stake a claim.

423
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:02,048
OK. You all need
to snap out of it.

424
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:04,351
Izzie, in the Wild Wild West

425
00:25:04,453 --> 00:25:07,738
there is always a woman in the
saloon and nobody messes with her,

426
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,791
- even though
they all have guns.
- She's a prostitute.

427
00:25:10,893 --> 00:25:13,359
The woman in the
saloon is a whore, George.

428
00:25:13,462 --> 00:25:18,114
No. She just has other skills she
uses to make her way in the world.

429
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:21,151
So just use what you got.

430
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:24,037
Mer, I'm gonna take this,

431
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,708
and I need you to help me sell
an idea to Hahn and the Chief.

432
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:32,028
Cristina? You're coming, too.

433
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,297
Cristina!

434
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,506
How are you doing, Mr. Grandy?

435
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:44,374
Well...

436
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:49,579
I've got a tumor that's been
compared to a baseball, a grapefruit,

437
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:52,599
and an alien living
inside my head,

438
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:57,504
and... my wife, who
was ready to divorce me

439
00:25:57,606 --> 00:26:00,707
even before she knew
that I was damaged goods,

440
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,509
she won't even look at me.

441
00:26:02,611 --> 00:26:06,313
I'm sure she's just freaked out
about the tumor. It happens a lot.

442
00:26:06,415 --> 00:26:08,226
What if it isn't just the tumor?

443
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:13,003
I mean, what if she's figured
out that she just doesn't like me?

444
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:16,940
No. You're a really
likeable guy, I can tell.

445
00:26:18,127 --> 00:26:19,326
You're a nice girl.

446
00:26:21,296 --> 00:26:25,883
Is... Is your new doctor
as nice as me? Dr. Karev?

447
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:28,285
He's all right.

448
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:31,354
That's good. Yeah.

449
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:36,426
He was having some
personal problems, depression.

450
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:39,279
He's been a little
off his game, but...

451
00:26:40,382 --> 00:26:42,049
"Off his game?"

452
00:26:42,151 --> 00:26:44,617
Sounds like he's bouncing
back. You'll be fine.

453
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,771
Wait. I don't want someone
who's "Off his game."

454
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:51,458
Can I get you back?

455
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,427
Oh, gee. Um, well...

456
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,462
Well, you could
talk to Dr. Shepherd,

457
00:26:56,565 --> 00:27:00,233
tell him you don't want Dr. Karev
on your case, then I'm all yours.

458
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,759
- What happened?
- She said she was
feeling faint.

459
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:11,561
I thought she was pissed
about waiting for her cream.

460
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:14,314
- Her pulse ox is 90?
- The oxygen's not helping.

461
00:27:14,417 --> 00:27:16,566
Get her to the ER.

462
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:19,786
- Why didn't you
move her to the ER?
- I don't know what to do.

463
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:23,557
- You've been standing here?
- I paged you. Where've you been?

464
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,763
OK. Aggressive fluids,
support care, steroids...

465
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:31,982
- Give her 16 of dexamethasone.
- Right away.

466
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:35,786
Hurry! Come on!

467
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:47,381
BP's going back up.

468
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,418
OK, um...

469
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,854
Call Dr. Bailey and tell her the
patient needs plasmapheresis

470
00:27:54,956 --> 00:27:56,956
and a skin biopsy, stat.

471
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:05,115
- You stole my surgery.
- It's my surgery.

472
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:09,552
Using me as a doormat is one thing,
screwing with my career is another.

473
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:14,007
I have been wiping your snot and
covering your ass for weeks now,

474
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,754
and all you've done is abuse me.

475
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:17,772
For a little while
you get to do that

476
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:21,999
because you're heartbroken and pathetic,
and I'm a good friend, but it ends.

477
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:24,301
Get your own surgeries,
wipe your own snot.

478
00:28:24,386 --> 00:28:28,088
- Dr. Shepherd,
that's my surgery.
- The patient made the request.

479
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,223
Nothing I can do.

480
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:38,426
Sixty percent of her
skin sloughed off.

481
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,395
I'm surprised she didn't
crash when she got out of bed.

482
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:44,554
Dr. Sloan didn't catch it when
he was down for a consult?

483
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:48,759
He may have been distracted by the fact
I told him it was necrotizing fasciitis.

484
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:51,411
- That'd do it.
- Can I do the biopsy?

485
00:28:51,514 --> 00:28:55,065
Sure. I didn't know you had
a big interest in dermatology.

486
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:57,500
No... I don't. Just
the surgical part.

487
00:28:57,586 --> 00:28:59,736
That's all right. It's
good. Branch out.

488
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,288
Dr. Bailey, I'm not
interested in Derm...

489
00:29:03,892 --> 00:29:06,276
atology.

490
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:09,446
We're doing a bicoronal
incision. Expect a lot of bleeding.

491
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:12,933
Once I get going it'll all
happen fast, so stay with me.

492
00:29:13,035 --> 00:29:14,985
Stevens, grab a Bovie.

493
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:20,440
All right. Here we go.

494
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:42,295
You are not bringing an
8-year-old child into the OR.

495
00:29:42,397 --> 00:29:46,450
He's scared, doesn't know what's gonna
happen. No way for him to imagine it.

496
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:48,868
Letting the boy see a
bloody OR isn't gonna help.

497
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,938
Dr. Hahn has a thorascopic
lung resection in an hour.

498
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,635
- Three tiny incisions,
no blood.
- What's that gonna do?

499
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:58,778
It shows him the room, the instruments,
someone under anesthesia, still alive.

500
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,948
Pinning him down
and doping him up is...

501
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:04,568
It's gonna be
traumatic for him, and...

502
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,370
Showing him how it
works is such an easy fix.

503
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:16,312
- You can't see, can you?
- Nope.

504
00:30:21,202 --> 00:30:22,969
I don't want to go in there.

505
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:25,772
Scared?

506
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:32,979
Well, there's not gonna be any
blood, nothing gross, nothing scary.

507
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:37,801
Just three tiny cuts that are so
small you can barely see 'em.

<i>♪ And so right here I stay ♪</i>

509
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:48,995
The first time that I went in
there, that room, I was scared.

510
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,882
But that room is the most
magical room in the world.

511
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:54,195
Only the finest doctors
get to go in there.

512
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:58,555
A lot of the great ones are not even
allowed to touch anything, just watch.

513
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:01,358
I'm pretty good, so
I'm still a watcher.

514
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,828
The people that work
in there, they're the best.

515
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:07,430
The very best.

516
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:11,768

ever be in in your entire life.

- You lost, O'Malley?
- Sorry!

522
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:36,693
No, wait! I want to see! I want to
see the guy with no face! Stop! Stop!

523
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:42,466
Promise not to mention this to anyone,
I'll give you what you want for life.

- OK.

525
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,686
Good afternoon, Duncan.

526
00:31:46,788 --> 00:31:48,966

I want to go back
to the other one.

530
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,867
We're not talking
about the other one.

531
00:32:00,969 --> 00:32:04,187
- This one's boring.
- Well, yours will be
boring too.

532
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:10,626
- Do I get the big lights?
- Yeah. You get
all the big lights.

533
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:13,063
- Where's the suctioner?
- Right over there.

534
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:15,648
Can I feel it? I just
want to feel it once.

535
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,185
Move over first.

536
00:32:21,055 --> 00:32:22,772
Can I touch the scalpel?

537
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:26,810
- You just need to lie down.
- I just want to see everything.

538
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:30,814
- Look here. See this?
- Yeah.

539
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:34,885
It's a video camera. You'll be able to
watch the whole thing when it's over.

540
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:38,404
- Start shooting right now.
- Lie down.

541
00:32:40,141 --> 00:32:42,292
See you after surgery.

542
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:46,512
OK, don't squeeze too hard.

543
00:32:46,615 --> 00:32:49,348
The teeth on the
forceps can leave holes.

544
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:51,067
That's good.

545
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,538
Very good. Keep
going on that plane.

546
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,175
Great. OK, let me take over.

547
00:33:07,502 --> 00:33:09,582
Cowboys don't have friends.

548
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,324
Dr. Grey, you ready?

549
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:17,944
Have good visualization
and start suturing right here.

550
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,001
All right. Keep going.

551
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:25,885
Very nice.

552
00:33:25,988 --> 00:33:28,855
All right. Give her a
little room, O'Malley.

553
00:33:28,957 --> 00:33:30,557
OK.

554
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:31,775
Beautiful.

555
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:33,359
You can tell Dr. Yang

556
00:33:33,461 --> 00:33:37,030
she's a better teacher
than I would've thought.

557
00:33:37,132 --> 00:33:39,532
- Sorry.
- Save it.

558
00:33:39,634 --> 00:33:43,097
Your colleagues know more than
you do, milk them for all they're worth.

559
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:47,273
Lie to me again about your experience,
the next heart you see will be your own

560
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:50,815
as I cut it out of your
chest with a steak knife.

561
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:59,385
Mrs. Grandy, your
husband is in recovery.

562
00:33:59,488 --> 00:34:02,722
It was a tough procedure,
but overall it went really well.

563
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,677
He's gonna be OK, Mrs. Grandy.

564
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,930
He is never gonna forgive me.

565
00:34:11,032 --> 00:34:15,752
He was sick, and I told
him he was lazy and boring.

566
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:17,888
He was sick. You didn't know.

567
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:20,510
Well, I'm his wife.
I should've known.

568
00:34:26,748 --> 00:34:31,017
People are terrible to the
people they love sometimes.

569
00:34:31,886 --> 00:34:34,254
They're mean.

570
00:34:34,356 --> 00:34:36,722
You were both going
through a really hard time

571
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:40,360
and took it out on one another. It
isn't fun, but it is what people do.

572
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:44,130
It doesn't make you the
worst wife in the world.

573
00:34:44,232 --> 00:34:47,167
It just makes you a person
who made a mistake.

You're gonna love this. The
redhead just gave the short one a case

581
00:35:14,229 --> 00:35:18,714
because she thought he'd find it
interesting. A pyogenic granuloma.

582
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:20,216
Gave it away.

583
00:35:20,301 --> 00:35:22,402
We could transfer.

584
00:35:22,504 --> 00:35:26,389
- Maybe we'd be happier.
- We'd die of boredom.

585
00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:28,959
Die with great skin.

586
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,061
I had the biggest derm
emergency that exists today,

587
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:35,532
and it was fun for about a minute,
'cause the woman almost died,

588
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:38,267
then we saved her, and all
she needed was a stupid biopsy.

589
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:42,888
- I tore a guy's face off.
- I reattached
a coronary artery.

590
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,609
I hate you both.

591
00:35:47,596 --> 00:35:50,764

00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,623
Still no word on the test?

596
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,227

- It'll be OK.

597
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:08,198

- Sure.

615
00:37:13,215 --> 00:37:15,598
No. I'm just gonna

617
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:26,459
George passed his exam.

619
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,219

- You're the best roommate ever.
- I am.

621
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:42,225
Just to be clear, you two pull
that crap on one of my cases again,

622
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:44,844
I will have you thrown
out of the program.

623
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:02,757
You know what? I'll take
my drink at the table...

624
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,382
I know, OK? I know
I'm being an ass.

625
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:09,152
I can't help it. I'm
pissed off all the time,

626
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:10,854
so much I can't even breathe.

627
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:13,890
You can't be pissed at a
crazy chick for losing her mind.

628
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:16,776
There's nobody else to
be pissed at except you.

629
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:19,645
Nobody else.

630
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,220
We need to have rules.

631
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,006
- What?
- Rules.

632
00:38:47,108 --> 00:38:50,393
We need rules about how we're
gonna deal with the motherland,

633
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:55,731
because it's undiscovered
country, and...

634
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:59,935
maybe it'll be the best vacation
either of us has ever had,

635
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:03,239
but... it's mysterious

636
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,709
and dark, and there
should be rules.

637
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,745
Oh, and an embassy.

638
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,382
And a safe word.

639
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:18,454
I'm sorry. What the hell
are you talking about?

640
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:20,789
Below the...

641
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:24,727
Below the Mason-Dixon
line. Of your pants.

642
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:31,000
I'm not sure I'm
ready to go there.

643
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:35,805
Me neither.

644
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:43,246
There's lots of undiscovered
territory above the belt. Uh...

645
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:45,298
We can take it slow.

646
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,686
Maybe... just first base.

647
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:55,391
OK.

648
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,827
Whoo! OK. Thank you.

649
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,429
Sorry.

650
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:02,682
Finish my wine.

651
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:05,284
I'm gonna look at the menu

652
00:40:05,386 --> 00:40:09,106
while you let your blood
pressure drop back down to normal.

653
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,459

No, I want you here.

660
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:48,678
I mean, I may not always
be so graceful about it, but...

661

I want you here.

662
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,745
You need a place
for your things.

663
00:40:54,769 --> 00:40:57,270
It's not an
unreasonable request.

664
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:02,158
You can use this as your
den or your office or whatever.

665
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:05,295
It's your mom's den.

666

You need someplace.

Someplace you can get away to.

672
00:41:31,138 --> 00:41:34,306
Well, I can always go
to Cristina's or whatever.

673
00:41:35,476 --> 00:41:37,043
