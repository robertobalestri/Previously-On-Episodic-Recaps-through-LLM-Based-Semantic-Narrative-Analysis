1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:08,907
<i>Every patient's story
starts the same way.</i>

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,444
<i>It starts with them being fine.</i>

3
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:15,713
<i>It starts in the "before."</i>

4
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:19,467
<i>They cling to this moment,
this memory of being fine,</i>

5
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:22,187
<i>this before, as
though talking about it</i>

6
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:23,299
<i>may somehow bring it back.</i>

7
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,306
- Long time.
- Naomi.

8
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:27,570
We got an ICU bed
all ready for him.

9
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,460
<i>But what they
don't realize is that</i>

10
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:32,597
<i>the fact that they're
talking about it to us,</i>

11
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,466
<i>their doctors...</i>

12
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:37,269
He was fine. We went to lunch...

13
00:00:37,354 --> 00:00:40,755
<i>means there's no going back.</i>

14
00:00:40,858 --> 00:00:43,792
<i>By the time they see us,</i>

15
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:46,695
<i>they're already in the "after."</i>

16
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,058
<i>♪ She's letting everything in ♪</i>

17
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:52,266
<i>♪ Trouble is that
it's gotta come out ♪</i>

18
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:54,197
What the hell are you doing?

19
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,687
The interns are broken.

20
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,473
They've been punished for
taking out their own appendixes

21
00:00:58,575 --> 00:01:00,626
and it's making them
hate medicine. They're lost,

22
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,461
and they've forgotten
this thing they hate

23
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:03,763
is actually a thing they love,

24
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:06,198
so I'm gonna remind them.

25
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:09,701
Is this about Denny?

26
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:12,704
Is this some kind of dead
boyfriend art therapy?

27
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:14,823
This is not about Denny.
It's about the interns.

28
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:18,026
- Who cares? They're losers...
- They're not!

29
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:19,694
They're not. They're just...

30
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:23,281
They need to have a
little fun. And so do I.

31
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:26,584
Where are the damn scissors?

32
00:01:28,806 --> 00:01:31,246
They're right in front of you.

33
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,742
Oh.

34
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,428
- Right.
- Iz...

35
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,297
Will you hand me
that large bow, please?

36
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,401
Great. Just put it down.

37
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:47,339
See? It's gonna be great.

38
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,453
Does he know how
he got the parasite?

39
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:51,426
From eating unwashed
fruit in Mexico.

40
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,095
- He's bradycardic.
- And hypotensive?

41
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:57,115
A reaction to the fentanyl drip.
Stop the drip, push Narcan...

42
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,934
Wait! Derek, he was in status.

43
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,635
If you take him
off and he seizes,

44
00:02:00,737 --> 00:02:01,857
there could be brain damage.

45
00:02:01,906 --> 00:02:03,149
Better hope that doesn't happen.

46
00:02:03,173 --> 00:02:04,373
Hope?

47
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:06,441
That's what your
plan is hinging on?

48
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,226
Hoping the worst doesn't happen?

49
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:11,396
I'm hoping he's stopped seizing.
If we don't reverse the drip,

50
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:12,525
his heart is going to arrest.

51
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,869
So unless you
have a better idea.

52
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:16,495
Push the Narcan.

53
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:18,330
<i>And while every patient's story</i>

54
00:02:18,354 --> 00:02:19,721
<i>starts the same way,</i>

55
00:02:19,823 --> 00:02:21,540
<i>how the story ends...</i>

56
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:25,877
<i>depends on us, on how
well we diagnose and treat.</i>

57
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,490
<i>We know the
story hinges on us...</i>

58
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:30,259
He's in v-fib. Get
the crash cart.

59
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,661
<i>And we all want to be the hero.</i>

60
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,752
Morning, Chief. I heard
there was a guy here

61
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:42,160
with worms in his brain.

62
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:47,649
Does anyone know the medical
term for worms in the brain?

63
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:53,238
Dr. Stevens requested you
today for a special project.

64
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,907
OK, take an envelope,
pass the rest back.

65
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,609
Do not open them,
you'll need them

66
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,444
for the first game
we're gonna play.

67
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:02,007
That's what we're doing
today? Playing games?

68
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:04,399
Cheer up. We are
gonna have so much fun!

69
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:06,918
Don't open! Don't you know
how to play a simple game?

70
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:09,988
- I did when I was eight.
- Let's just go.

71
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:15,855
Dr. Bailey's with Addison,

72
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,773
so I'm gonna hand
out your assignments.

73
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,425
Addison's in the hospital?

74
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,550
Her brother was admitted
with parasites in his brain.

75
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:25,887
Addison's brother has
neurocysticercosis?

76
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,684
- See?
- Huh?

77
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,909
That's what I'm taking about!

78
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:35,575
I cleared my schedule.

79
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,050
You didn't have
to do that. I'm fine.

80
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:40,018
Your brother has parasites.

81
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,320
I cleared my schedule.
You cut your hair.

82
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:46,074
- Yeah.
- I like it. Dr. Miranda Bailey.

83
00:03:46,176 --> 00:03:48,527
I'm sorry. Miranda,
Naomi. Naomi, Miranda.

84
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,179
Naomi's our fertility
specialist at Oceanside

85
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:52,792
and one of my oldest friends.

86
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,999
- Nice to meet you, Miranda.
- How is he?

87
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:57,569
- I don't know.
- He's groggy.

88
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,549
His eyes are open but
I don't think he's awake.

89
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,718
He hasn't tried to kill me.

90
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,408
Her brother hates me.

91
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,426
People pick sides
in a divorce, Derek.

92
00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:07,290
He picked sides in the marriage.

93
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:10,699
He first seized during
sex with his girlfriend.

94
00:04:10,801 --> 00:04:12,441
Wonder why she's not here?

95
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,870
Oh, she is.

96
00:04:16,406 --> 00:04:18,289
Naomi?

97
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,758
I'm going in there.

98
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:25,997
- You and Archer?
- No.

99
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:30,602
Well, yeah. I don't know.
I don't know what we are.

100
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,012
How's Sam?

101
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:38,927
Sam's good. And how's...
Meredith, is that her name?

102
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,529
She's good.

103
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:43,151
- Good.
- Yeah.

104
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,283
Look at us.

105
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,536
We're making polite
conversation about your girlfriend.

106
00:04:48,638 --> 00:04:51,456
You two are divorced,
me and Sam are divorced.

107
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:54,809
I'm with Archer, sort of...

108
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,377
What the hell happened?

109
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,147
I mean, you wrote
Addison a song, Derek.

110
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:00,910
Let's forget about the song.

111
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,494
- Enough about the song.
- What?

112
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,168
You wrote her her own love song

113
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,837
and sang it to her
at the wedding.

114
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:08,217
Mark wrote it or Sam.
I don't remember.

115
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,375
I do. I was drunk at the time,

116
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,345
but I remember thinking
you were going to last forever.

117
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:15,613
We were all gonna last forever.

118
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,382
Yeah.

119
00:05:18,435 --> 00:05:20,802
You should call
Sam. He misses you.

120
00:05:21,438 --> 00:05:22,787
Yeah.

121
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,458
- How'd you sleep?
- Not too well.

122
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:31,363
- Shoulder pain?
- No. Pain in the ass wife.

123
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,393
I kept him up
because I was afraid

124
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,027
my aneurysm was gonna explode

125
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:36,718
and I was gonna die.

126
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,071
- Hi, I'm Dr. Karev.
- Where's Dr. Grey?

127
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,773
She's supposed
to be in my surgery.

128
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,409
She and Dr. Shepherd got
called in on an emergency.

129
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,562
So he's not going to get
to your aneurysm until later.

130
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:51,165
- Wha... Later when?
- Could be a few hours.

131
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,148
- Could be tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

132
00:05:53,203 --> 00:05:55,620
She's waited until
tomorrow. Today is tomorrow.

133
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,723
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- I'm her husband.

134
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,843
- I look like this because...
- I ran him over with our car.

135
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:06,164
Before I knew I had this
huge time bomb in my head.

136
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,817
When I was just a big
old pregnant person

137
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:10,284
waiting for her baby.

138
00:06:10,386 --> 00:06:12,970
So, just... please,

139
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:16,675
if he could get to me
sooner rather than later...

140
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,444
Um...

141
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,280
- What's the emergency?
- Addison's brother.

142
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,416
Addison's here?

143
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:26,985
We were having dinner
and he just passed out.

144
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:30,021
I am telling you, it is
probably just my hernia.

145
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:31,422
He has an inguinal hernia.

146
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:34,759
It doesn't seem to be
the source of obstruction.

147
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:35,939
It's gonna take these
doctors a long time

148
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:38,679
to figure this out. I'm fine.

149
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:40,348
You gotta go to work.

150
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,890
He hates it when
we try to help him.

151
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,240
He's a lot like my
second graders that way.

152
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,266
OK, Daddy. You win.

153
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,542
I have my cell, so
call me if you need me.

154
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,744
Bye.

155
00:06:58,068 --> 00:07:00,218
I have colorectal cancer.

156
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,564
I've had five polyps removed

157
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,171
in the last three
years and radiation.

158
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:06,808
My daughter doesn't know
and I'd like to keep it that way.

159
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,162
Um... Dr. Yang's going to set
you up for a CT with contrast.

160
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,610
Where have you been
treated? We'll need your records.

161
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:17,268
Columbia Hospital
in Verona. Dr. Shulty.

162
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,692
I... I work here now.

163
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:26,238
I saw you were in and I...

164
00:07:26,262 --> 00:07:29,497
You waited till she left
to come in and say hello.

165
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,300
Just like you to face
up to things like a man.

166
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:38,623
You should tell her about the
cancer. She deserves to know.

167
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:41,326
You lost the right to tell
me anything about her

168
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:45,180
when you broke off your
engagement in a two line email.

169
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:54,338
<i>♪ Our eyes met

170
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,359
<i>♪ And I knew I had to have her ♪</i>

171
00:07:57,461 --> 00:07:59,911
What was the next line?

172
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:02,630

<i>♪ Is that what made
our cadaver so sick? ♪</i>

175
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,207
- Greatest love song
of all time.
- Hey!

176
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:16,628
You get to the part where Derek
rhymes "gross anatomy class"

177
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:20,332
with "Addison's fine ass,"
because I wrote that line.

178
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:24,652
- Oh, my bad.
- No, no, it's fine. I, uh...

179
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,071
I think it sounds
like a fine song.

180
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,613
Archie, heard you
were gonna let Derek

181
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,537
remove those suckers
from your brain.

182
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:33,561
- Maybe.
- He is.

183
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:36,748
I hate surgery.
Especially brain surgery.

184
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,132
Yeah.

185
00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:41,269
Being a neurologist you probably
see a lot of patients post-op

186
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:43,437
who are scrambled
eggs up there...

187
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:45,101
You're not helping.

188
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:49,043
We're sitting here trying to
convince him that surgery is...

189
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:52,013
Is not an option.

190
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,394
According to these
scans, the single cyst

191
00:08:54,418 --> 00:08:56,095
you had on your last CT

192
00:08:56,119 --> 00:09:00,621
has now multiplied by eight,
all clogging the third ventricle.

193
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:02,284
There's no way I could
surgically navigate

194
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,536
through a mess like that

195
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,960
without rupturing one.

196
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:07,895
So, what does that mean?

197
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:14,852
You're in a room full
of doctors, Addison,

198
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:18,439
who are all being
very quiet right now.

199
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:26,080
I'm gonna die.
That's what it means.

200
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,809
Inside each one
of your envelopes

201
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,354
is the name of a surgery.

202
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,913
Your task is to drape
your patients accordingly.

203
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:45,450
On your marks, get set... Go!

204
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,038
Come on, lighten up,
this is supposed to be fun.

205
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,362
Don't take it so seriously.

206
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:01,749
You suck at this! My grandmother
could drape better than you!

207
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,562
I'm sorry. I'll
try to do better...

208
00:10:03,586 --> 00:10:06,237
No, you're doing great.

209
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,340
I'm trash talking. I'm
having fun. It's just... fun.

210
00:10:13,497 --> 00:10:16,097
What are you...? Woo!

211
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,100
Woo! Woo! Woo!

212
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,436
Looking good! Good job!

213
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,304
Done!

214
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:26,591
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy
- Yeah, that's good.

215
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:29,810
- Your next challenge.
- I'm done, too.

216
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:34,315
A whipple is for
pancreatic cancer.

217
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:37,385
Were you planning on
going in through the mouth?

218
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,837
Start over.

219
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:54,886
There's just no way, Addie.

220
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,055
Dr. Conroy at Cedars and
Larry at Mayo, they agree...

221
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:03,594
I've put you in a tiny box.

222
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:08,599
After the divorce I made
you petty and inconsequential

223
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:09,834
and nothing special,

224
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:15,340
so that you could fit
into this tiny, little box

225
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:18,043
that would help me get
out of bed in the morning.

226
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:20,394
But now...

227
00:11:20,496 --> 00:11:23,297
now I have to take
you out of the box

228
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:26,668
because I need to
believe that you can do this,

229
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,903
that you can save my brother.

230
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:30,971
I need you to be a god.

231
00:11:31,073 --> 00:11:34,875
Just today. Be a god.

232
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:46,503
Montgomery,
Archer. I'm a friend.

233
00:11:48,258 --> 00:11:51,109
I'm Dr. Miranda Bailey.
I'm a friend of Addison's.

234
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,260
- Which one are you?
- I'm sorry?

235
00:11:53,363 --> 00:11:55,483
Archer is Addison's brother.

236
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,376
Archer's girlfriend is
Addison's best friend

237
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,935
who married Derek's best
friend who Derek hasn't spoken to

238
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:03,138
- since the divorce.
- That would be me.

239
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,425
The ex-husband,
Dr. Samuel Bennett.

240
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:11,245
Sorry, I didn't think
the ex-husband

241
00:12:11,348 --> 00:12:15,082
would show up at the
ex-wife's boyfriend's bedside.

242
00:12:15,184 --> 00:12:19,053
Don't worry about it. Even
I don't know why I'm here.

243
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,710
- But... yeah.
- Third floor. Room 3420.

244
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,962
Thank you.

245
00:12:28,064 --> 00:12:32,300
- Dr. Bennett.
- Uh... Sam.

246
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:35,169
Dr. Shepherd is still
studying the scans

247
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:36,682
looking for a way to operate

248
00:12:36,706 --> 00:12:39,186
but it looks like
a difficult case.

249
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,409
Right.

250
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:47,548
Hey, Addison's brother
probably isn't gonna make it.

251
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,418
- His cysts are inoperable.
- Worms in the brain.

252
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,863
Not how you want to go.

253
00:12:51,887 --> 00:12:53,887
I didn't know
Addison had a brother.

254
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:56,341
You'd think Derek would have
said something at some point.

255
00:12:56,443 --> 00:13:00,311
Or sang something
while he played his guitar.

256
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:03,598
- Speak English.
- Derek used to play guitar.

257
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,778
Owen's ex-fiancée
is in the hospital.

258
00:13:05,802 --> 00:13:09,704
Mm-hm. His ex-fiancée
he never told me about.

259
00:13:09,806 --> 00:13:13,441
- What's wrong with her?
- She calls her dad "daddy."

260
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,377
No, what's wrong with her?
Why is she in the hospital?

261
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:19,797
She isn't. Daddy is.

262
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,683
You should ask Owen
if he plays the guitar.

263
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,632
"Find Dr. Sloan,
ask his symptoms,

264
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:29,040
diagnose him correctly to
receive your next challenge!"

265
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,253
What are your symptoms?

266
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:32,627
Right now, I'm battling
a rapid heart rate,

267
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,629
also feeling a little flushed.

268
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,875
I don't even want to mention
what's going on below the belt.

269
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,518
I don't do dirty, secret
flirting with you, anymore.

270
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,088
I told you, if you want to
go public with me, with us,

271
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,942
I will do dirty public flirting.
I mean, I will flirt publicly,

272
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:50,278
not dirtily...

273
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,280
maybe a little dirtily.

274
00:13:52,382 --> 00:13:54,663
Please tell me your
symptoms so I can concentrate.

275
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,269
Tachycardia,
angioedema, hypotension,

276
00:13:58,371 --> 00:13:59,848
severe chest and abdominal pain,

277
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,600
difficulty breathing,
throat closing.

278
00:14:01,624 --> 00:14:02,684
Anaphylactic shock!

279
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,493
- Whoa! Whoa. Whoa. whoa. Foul!
- What?

280
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,229
- You heard her answer.
- The whole hospital heard.

281
00:14:08,331 --> 00:14:11,382
You should've kept a distance.
New symptoms. Resume play.

282
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,001
Woo!

283
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,189
You must have questions, so ask.

284
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,436
When was his last polypectomy,

285
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,154
since you're familiar
with the patient?

286
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:24,395
- Not what I meant.
- I know what you meant.

287
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,537
- Dr. Yang, symptoms?
- Not a good time...

288
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,759
Heavy feeling in the abdomen,
accompanied by nausea

289
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:31,969
and an acute pulling
sensation in the scrotum.

290
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,187
Testicular cancer!

291
00:14:34,324 --> 00:14:36,490
Woo!

292
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:40,878
- Cristina...
- I have to get
Mr. Whitman to the CT.

293
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,631
I wasn't doing anyone
any good at school so...

294
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,337
Owen?

295
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,858
I don't understand. What...?

296
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,843
I work here.

297
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,462
What do you mean?

298
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,631
What do you mean?

299
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:04,918
- Beth.
- When did you get back?

300
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,526
I just saw your
mom. She didn't...

301
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:19,700
I thought you were in Iraq.

302
00:15:19,802 --> 00:15:23,170
I've been praying
for you every night.

303
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,373
Every night, I'm on my knees,

304
00:15:26,475 --> 00:15:29,309
praying that you're
gonna make it back,

305
00:15:29,412 --> 00:15:31,396
that you'll make it
another 24 hours,

306
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:35,099
that you... you'll make it home.

307
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:41,772
Owen, you're back!

308
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:16,306
- What is she doing?
- It looks like she's praying.

309
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,226
Mm, no... Addie doesn't pray.

310
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:22,546
- What's she doing?
- Uh, she's praying.

311
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,749
Addison doesn't pray.
She must be hiding.

312
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:29,120
I can hear you. I'm not
hiding, I am trying to pray,

313
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:31,000
but I don't know how
because I'm a WASP.

314
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:33,541
We only go to
church on Christmas.

315
00:16:33,642 --> 00:16:34,992
You guys go. I got this.

319
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:54,528
I have no clout with God.

320
00:16:54,631 --> 00:16:57,665
God doesn't even know who I am.

321
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,501
Which sucks, because I could...

322
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:06,393
I could use some help.

323
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:18,269
Dear God, I need your guidance.

324
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,591
- I kissed a peds surgeon.
- You kissed a peds surgeon?

325
00:17:23,693 --> 00:17:26,694
I never thought I'd end up
with a woman. Not until lately.

326
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,240
That's not the problem, the
problem is the peds thing.

327
00:17:29,264 --> 00:17:30,615
She's perky...

328
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,550
and has butterflies
on her scrub cap.

329
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,222
But she's... also hot.

330
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:42,659
Really hot. So...

331
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:45,046
help me get over
the butterflies.

332
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:47,815
Amen.

333

335
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,199
You're an amazing
doctor, you save babies.

336
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:00,528
God knows who you are.

337
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:06,968
Do you really
believe in all this?

338
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:10,004
In God?

339
00:18:11,107 --> 00:18:12,790
Sometimes.

340
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:16,510
Mm. Most of the time.

341
00:18:16,612 --> 00:18:19,347
When it counts.

342
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,305
Your wife's in the
chapel, praying.

343
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,175
She's not my wife
and she doesn't pray.

344
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,189
- How are you?
- Hey.

345
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:36,998
You know, midlife crisis.

346
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,352
I got an earring, but I let the
hole close up the very next day.

347
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,365
That would have
been a good look.

348
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:45,222
I met, uh... Meredith.

349
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,225
Uh-huh.

350
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,913
She's not a midlife
crisis. She's the real thing.

351
00:18:52,015 --> 00:18:53,714
That's great. I'm
happy for you, man.

352
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:57,067
- Happy for you.
- Yeah.

353
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,037
- I should have called...
- No.

354
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,101
Stayed in touch. It's my fault.

355
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,892
People move, they
change, we all did.

356
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:08,112
- Yeah.
- So... But, yeah.

357
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:10,915
She's praying.

358
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:15,152
Yeah. She's expecting a miracle.

359
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:19,640
I can't deliver one.

360
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:23,077
I've seen patients with one
cyst in the ventricle, maybe two.

361
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:24,745
He has eight.

362
00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:27,209
There is no way I can
get a scope in there

363
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,850
without rupturing
one. There's too many.

364
00:19:32,655 --> 00:19:36,273
Maybe you're just too close to
it. What if there were just one?

365
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:41,012
Explain to me how you
would remove just that one.

366
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:46,166
110 over 80.

367
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,729
What's the prize for winning?

368
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,971
- They need a prize.
- They're getting a prize.

369
00:19:51,073 --> 00:19:53,140
A really big prize.

370
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:56,110
- I need a prize.
- What's going on?

371
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:57,945
Uh, my patients
needed a distraction

372
00:19:58,047 --> 00:20:00,063
and Izzie needed real patients.

373
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:03,384
- How's it going?
- It's going great. We're having fun.

374
00:20:03,486 --> 00:20:06,020
Dr. Grey! Am I
going to surgery now?

375
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,255
Could be any time now.

376
00:20:11,327 --> 00:20:12,727
What?

377
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:15,246
- I can't find it.
- Wh...?

378
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:19,566
Is something wrong? Is
the baby's heart not beating?

379
00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:22,069
You're on the kid's ass.

380
00:20:22,739 --> 00:20:24,371
The heart's over here.

381
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,702
It's not what you think.

382
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:43,006
I can guarantee I'm not as
much of an ass as you think I am.

383
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,548
Does your mother
know you're back?

384
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,721
Page me when this is done.

385
00:20:56,071 --> 00:20:58,488
All right, Archer. I need to
create room in the ventricle

386
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,007
so I can maneuver the scope.

387
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:02,727
If I deflate each cyst, the
scope can remove them.

388
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:04,161
The cysts will rupture.

389
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,573
I'm going to grab
each one with forceps,

390
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,731
pull it up, suction the fluid.

391
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,544
Suction would
have to be precise.

392
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,701
It will be.

393
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:14,021
- You can't do it.
- I think I can.

394
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,500
Control the way
the cyst ruptures?

395
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,602
No, he can't.

396
00:21:17,626 --> 00:21:18,820
You want me to go
down fighting but...

397
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,862
- Coward.
- Excuse me?

398
00:21:21,964 --> 00:21:23,247
You're a coward by trade.

399
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:24,643
You're a neurologist.
You feed off us,

400
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:25,532
refer your patients to us,

401
00:21:25,634 --> 00:21:28,552
let us assume
the responsibility,

402
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,721
and if something
happens, well...

403
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:34,641
I can assume the responsibility.
The question is, can you?

404
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,904
- A peds surgery fellowship?
- Yep.

405
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:06,873
Just when I'm almost done
with general surgery residency.

406
00:22:06,976 --> 00:22:11,195
- Crazy, huh?
- No. Just... surprising.

407
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:14,031
You don't seem like
a peds person to me.

408
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:17,968
- Why not?
- Because you don't smile.

409
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,105
- Peds people smile.
- I smile.

410
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:24,702
Well, I'm not
going to smile now.

411
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:27,211
But I do smile. I
smile frequently.

412
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:31,432
- Hey. He under yet?
- Yeah.

413
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,902
A peds surgery fellowship?

414
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:38,889
Huh.

415
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:41,425
I have a child. I am
familiar with children.

416
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,994
I am going to be an
excellent pediatric surgeon!

417
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:48,299
You're gonna want to keep that
temper in check around the kids.

418
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:50,761
Weird seeing
Archie on that table.

419
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:52,936
Yeah.

420
00:22:58,261 --> 00:23:00,795
Asthma. Looks like I'm low.

421
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:06,550
Chris, refill this for
Dr. Bennett here.

422
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:08,018
OK.

423
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:12,689
- Thanks.
- It's good practice.

424
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,292
Asthma's big with the kids.

425
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:25,552
Say it, Derek. Come on,
say it, say it, say it, say it...

426
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:34,345
OK, everybody. It's a
beautiful day to save lives.

427
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:36,280
Scalpel.

428
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:39,944
You're gonna have to tell her...

429
00:23:39,968 --> 00:23:42,069
This is Beth we're
talking about.

430
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,188
She worries herself sick

431
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:47,174
when one of her
students gets the sniffles.

432
00:23:47,276 --> 00:23:51,762
She can't handle bad
news. She's a sunshine girl.

433
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:54,881
And you used to
know that about her.

434
00:23:54,983 --> 00:23:56,961
Well, she'll find
out eventually.

435
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:03,941
- Dr. Yang!
- What's going on?

436
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:05,976
Ruth, call the Chief
and reserve an OR.

437
00:24:06,062 --> 00:24:09,229
- Owen?
- It's a...

438
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:12,917
It's a complication.
He needs surgery.

439
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:15,803
A complication from what?

440
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,591
He's going to be OK. I'll
keep you updated. Let's go.

441
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:28,198
Entering the third ventricle.

442
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,074
Securing cyst number one.

443
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:43,747
Deflating cyst one.

444
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,116
Applying suction.

445
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,247
Any sign of the scolex?

446
00:25:01,516 --> 00:25:03,183
There it is.

447
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:09,957
One at a time.

448
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:12,309
One at a time.

449
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:15,946
OK. I need to be distracted.

450
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,864
Someone talk about something

451
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:19,933
other than what's
going on with my brother.

452
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:23,837
Uh, Mark is good at
talking about himself.

453
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:28,075
I've been using endoscopy for
head and neck cancer resections.

454
00:25:28,177 --> 00:25:31,128
If I can just focus the
criteria for patients,

455
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,363
I might have a
breakthrough on my hands.

456
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:37,050
- What happened to you?
- He met someone.

457
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:41,238
Dr. Grey.

458
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:49,479
Dr. Torres said I
had to eat. I'm sorry.

459
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,999
It's OK. How is it?

460
00:25:52,101 --> 00:25:53,500
It's amazing.

461
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:02,125
I'm sorry. It's bland.
It's really bland.

462
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,827
I need my surgery now!

463
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,523
What kind of hospital is this?

464
00:26:05,547 --> 00:26:07,092
How long am I
supposed to wait...

465
00:26:07,116 --> 00:26:08,682
Stop it!

466
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:13,503
Look... if you don't settle down

467
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:14,783
your blood pressure's gonna rise

468
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:16,101
and you're gonna
start contracting.

469
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,808
Sorry, because I don't know you,

470
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,561
but you really need
to shut up, OK?

471
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,998
All right, look. There.

472
00:26:26,701 --> 00:26:30,004
Look, there's your son's face.

473
00:26:30,106 --> 00:26:32,033
That's what you
need to hold on to

474
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,377
for the next couple
of hours, OK?

475
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:50,039
Is that a tumor?

476
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:52,609
He's gonna need more
aggressive treatment.

477
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:55,362
- He'll have to tell
his daughter now.
- He won't.

478
00:26:55,464 --> 00:26:56,758
Her mother died
when she was little.

479
00:26:56,782 --> 00:27:00,751
He feels that's enough
sadness for anyone.

480
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:04,487
He sheltered her, she always
had a nice car, clothes, anything.

481
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:05,600
She'll find out eventually.

482
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,491
She used to call me in tears

483
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:09,513
when there was a
spider in her apartment.

484
00:27:09,578 --> 00:27:11,356
Became a joke
between Michael and I.

485
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,714
Neither of us could be out
of town at the same time

486
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,916
in case Beth found a bug.

487
00:27:16,018 --> 00:27:18,578
When he needs to
go through chemo

488
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:20,704
or gets so sick he
needs hospice care,

489
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,001
she'll find out when
it's already over.

490
00:27:23,025 --> 00:27:25,358
She deserves more than that.

491
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,796
What's the number?

492
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,726
Seven cysts, seven scolices.

493
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,867
OK, one more.

494
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:39,606
Damn it!

495
00:27:46,482 --> 00:27:47,525
He's getting bradycardic.

496
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:49,869
See if the flow is blocked.

497
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:56,523
Asystole. Start the code clock.

498
00:27:59,561 --> 00:28:04,048
- Derek, asystole.
- Where the hell is it?

499
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,227
Get the crash
cart. Compressions!

500
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,801
No! Stop. Nobody move.

501
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:09,780
We can't. I have
to find the worm.

502
00:28:09,804 --> 00:28:13,307
- But he's...
- We have two, three
minutes. Stop.

503
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,439
How long's he been down?

504
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:21,114
Two minutes, twenty seconds.

505
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:26,103
There.

506
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:32,909
Got it.

507
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:33,860
Damn it.

508
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,729
It's starting to tear apart.

509
00:28:36,831 --> 00:28:39,983
Maybe if I rotate and
reverse it back. Yeah.

510
00:28:47,509 --> 00:28:50,377
And that's number eight.

511
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,663
Heartrate's coming back up!

512
00:28:54,749 --> 00:28:56,617
OK.

513
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:02,155
Thank you, everybody. You made
some friends of mine very happy.

514
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:07,727
Just got out of surgery.
What's going on?

515
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,391
- Any minute.
- She needs a prize.

516
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:10,925
Big prize, but not too big,

517
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,950
because they did take
out their own appendixes

518
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:15,763
and they're being punished

519
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:19,889
and you think they're not even
qualified to hold a clamp. So...

520
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,686
Do you have prizes like that?

521
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:24,711
They got their symptoms
from their final patients.

522
00:29:24,813 --> 00:29:27,347
Get out the finish line,
it's gonna be close.

523
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:40,643
- Here they come!
- Come on!

524
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,007
Come on, bring it in!

Whoo! Ha!

536
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,998
Nicely done.

537
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:20,862
- Yes!
- Worms?

538
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:22,519
Wait, what's the prize?

539
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:25,588
You get to scrub in on
Shepherd's craniotomy

540
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,590
and hold the doomsday sucker.

541
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:30,076
- What's a doomsday sucker?
- Doomsday sucker?

542
00:30:30,178 --> 00:30:32,195
It's just a really big sucker.

<i>Dr. Leone call the blood bank.</i>

544
00:30:35,851 --> 00:30:38,184
<i>Dr. Leone, call the blood bank.</i>

545
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,855
It was a hard surgery,

546
00:30:41,957 --> 00:30:44,124
some of the bowel was
dead as we suspected,

547
00:30:44,226 --> 00:30:47,811
but we were able to remove
the diseased parts successfully.

548
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:50,881
He's in recovery. You can
see him in about an hour.

549
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:54,629
You don't even
look like yourself.

550
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:56,053
Excuse me?

551
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:57,395
You don't.

552
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:01,858
You look... hard.

553
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,811
And...

554
00:31:04,913 --> 00:31:07,581
Look, I know it
wasn't easy over there,

555
00:31:07,683 --> 00:31:11,618
I hear people come back and...

556
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:17,124
I know you can't just come back
and be normal right away, but...

557
00:31:17,226 --> 00:31:20,126
He'll be asleep for a couple
hours. You can see him now.

558
00:31:21,329 --> 00:31:23,764
Two lines in an email?

559
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:26,566
I deserve more than that.

560
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:34,568
Beth, your dad has
colorectal cancer.

561
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:38,478
He's been through radiation
treatments and polyp removals.

562
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,113
He didn't tell you...

563
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:45,752
because he didn't
want to burden you.

564
00:31:45,854 --> 00:31:48,871
He'd like to spare you any pain.

565
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:53,610
Any more pain.

566
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:07,223
He had all these friends.

567
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:10,494
They sang and
they played guitar.

568
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:13,596
It's like he was a
totally different person.

569
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,333
He was.

570
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,235
It freaks me out a little bit.

571
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,282
I feel like I don't know him.

572
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:26,509
Well, I don't know Owen.

573
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,696
We don't. We don't know them.

00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,336
I wanted to let you know,

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,338
I'm happy to help
you, if you'd like.

00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:46,997

Excuse me?

580
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,766
I was a repeater
earlier this year,

581
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:53,836
I know how easy
it is to get behind.

582
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,773
- I don't need a tutor.
- You don't?

583
00:32:57,876 --> 00:32:59,709
No.

584
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,456
At this point in your training,

585
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,913
you should be able to hear
symptoms, diagnose the problem

586
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:05,994
and decide whether or
not a patient needs surgery.

587
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:07,884
Can you do that?

588
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:12,555
Can you?

589
00:33:14,393 --> 00:33:16,926
Because they think you can.

590
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:20,430
And they will put you in
situations where you have to.

591
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,210
Sadie, you could hurt someone!

she thinks that I'm calling from...

597
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:58,217
I keep the conversations
short. I can't bear for her to know

598
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:01,588
that the son she
sent off to war is gone.

599
00:34:03,057 --> 00:34:05,792
He's gone.

600
00:34:05,894 --> 00:34:08,072
And if I just got in my car
and drove six miles to see her

601
00:34:08,096 --> 00:34:10,830
she'd be so... sad.

602
00:34:10,932 --> 00:34:14,100
And she would look at me the
same way that Beth does now.

603
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,520

congratulations are in order.

Thank you, Dr. Sloan.

625
00:35:38,787 --> 00:35:40,398
I'd also like it acknowledged

626
00:35:40,422 --> 00:35:42,333
that I offer these

Little Grey? Hmm.

00:36:21,029 --> 00:36:24,080
Derek's going to propose
to Meredith. How about that?

642
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,082
I'm off to surgery.

643
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:32,238
What?

644
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:35,274
Hey.

645
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:44,667
- Iz, what's going on with you?
- Nothing.

646
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:49,305
I'm fine. You saw. The interns
are not a bunch of losers.

647
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:52,475
They know things. They're
gonna make good doctors.

648
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,527
Really, I'm fine.

649
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,846
I'm fine.

650
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:00,967
She knows nothing. Nothing.

651
00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:02,568
She's a danger to the patients.

652
00:37:02,671 --> 00:37:04,871
I told her she could
tell the Chief or I could.

653
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,606
I wanted to let you know,
because you're her friend.

654
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:08,842
Although for the life of me,

655
00:37:08,944 --> 00:37:12,678
I don't know how you
two were ever friends.

656
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,270
- What happened?
- I quit.

657
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:22,839
O'Malley's a little narc.

658
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:25,742
I'd rather be deemed
a quitter than a cheater.

659
00:37:27,695 --> 00:37:29,628
Did you cheat your
way into the program?

660
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:35,568
I said I'm not book
smart. You know that.

661
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,536
I learn on my feet.

662
00:37:37,638 --> 00:37:41,207
I thought if I came to
where you were, you could...

663
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:43,009
Pull you through?

664
00:37:43,111 --> 00:37:46,579
We've seen each
other through a lot.

665
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,649
We're not 25 sleeping our
way through Europe anymore.

666
00:37:49,751 --> 00:37:53,169
We could, though.
Think about it.

667
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,482
We could get on
a plane and go...

668
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:56,906
No! No.

669
00:37:57,009 --> 00:37:59,692
I can't. I have to work.

670
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:01,844
I can't just...

671
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,714
Well, you know...

672
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:08,184
They've sucked the
life right out of you.

673
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:12,221
- The Meredith I used to know...
- Is right here.

674
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:13,456
I'm here.

675
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:15,486
I don't want to sleep my
way through Europe anymore.

676
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,293
I want to be here.

677
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:23,265
I want to be here.

678
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,300
- Sucker at the ready?
- Sucker's at the ready.

679
00:38:32,928 --> 00:38:36,329
- You're mocking me.
- Only a little.

680
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:38,948
- Damn it. Damn it!
- What? What happened?

681
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,734
- BP's 88 over 60.
- Hang two units of blood.

682
00:38:41,836 --> 00:38:44,887
All joking aside, Dr. Grey,
bring in the doomsday sucker.

683
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,556
- OK.
- Right in here. Go right in here.

684
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:50,021

OK, get the sucker out of there.

691
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,676
Is that it? Did you get it?

692
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:09,553
There's good flow.

693
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:12,996
Yes, we did it.

694
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,330
And that will teach
me to never mock

695
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,265
an eager young intern again.

696
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,830
- I'm an ass.
- You're such an ass.

697
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,798
I shouldn't have blurted.

698
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:31,934
A little warning
would've been nice.

699
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:33,047
But you're OK?

700
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:35,371
You know, it's strange. I...

701
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:37,573
I expected this
horrible feeling,

702
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:41,210
this wave of sadness or
something, to just take over.

703
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,697
But... people get divorced,

704
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,934
they meet new
people, they re-marry.

705
00:39:48,036 --> 00:39:51,921
I don't know, maybe it was
seeing Archer in that OR,

706
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:55,558
it just changed my perspective.

707
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,094
Or something.

708
00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:00,963
But you sort of wished
it had been you first.

709
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:04,317
Shut it! Are you gonna
tell Derek about the...

710
00:40:04,419 --> 00:40:07,136
Wait. If we called
Meredith the 12-year-old,

711
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,905
What do we call
Lexie? A preschooler?

712
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:10,184
She's a woman.

713
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:13,676
- Oh, OK.
- And I'm gonna tell him.

714
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:16,111
I'm working on it.

715
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:17,881
There he is!

716
00:40:19,601 --> 00:40:22,184
That's the kind of
welcome I deserve!

717
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:26,906
- Joe! Scotch for the neuro god!
- You were a god today.

718
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:28,241
You were a god in that OR.

719
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:31,444
You slew dragons, you
walked on water. You...

720
00:40:31,546 --> 00:40:34,013
You were a god, but now?

721
00:40:34,115 --> 00:40:37,783
Now you need to
get very tiny again.

722
00:40:38,786 --> 00:40:40,569
And go back in the box.

723
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,340
- How was your craniotomy?
- It was fine.

724
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,359
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I stopped in on Archer.

725
00:40:46,461 --> 00:40:47,643
Things are good.

726
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:50,480
Good.

727
00:40:50,565 --> 00:40:54,818
<i>♪ Had his mitral valve
gotten too thick? ♪</i>

728
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,480
- Oh, God!
- Shut up.

729
00:40:56,504 --> 00:41:01,107
<i>♪ Is that what made
the cadaver so sick? ♪</i>

730
00:41:02,777 --> 00:41:04,676
We can't remember the chorus.

731
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,974
We got all the way
through the second verse,

732
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:09,358
your name starts the chorus.

733
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:16,305
<i>♪ Addison Montgomery
he met her in the summery ♪</i>

734
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:17,907
It wasn't "summery."

735
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:19,329
I'd never use
"summery" as a noun.

736
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:22,027
"I met her in the
summer, she..."

737
00:41:22,129 --> 00:41:23,512
"Summer, she?" Really?

738
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,715
- Yeah.
- Come on.

739
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:26,950
Clever.

740
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:30,487

Aw, gee.

749
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,100
Yeah, you got it.

750
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:08,874
Oh, hopeless. Cheers.

751
00:42:08,976 --> 00:42:11,010
Wonderful. God.

752
00:42:14,316 --> 00:42:17,916
- What's happening?
- Page Shepherd. Now!
