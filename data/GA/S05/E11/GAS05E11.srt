1
00:00:03,854 --> 00:00:05,699
<i>We all get at least
one good wish a year...</i>

2
00:00:05,723 --> 00:00:08,456
<i>over the candles
on our birthday.</i>

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,759
<i>Some of us throw in more.</i>

4
00:00:11,861 --> 00:00:13,962
<i>On eyelashes...</i>

5
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:18,050
<i>fountains...</i>

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,785
<i>lucky stars.</i>

7
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:24,439
<i>And every now and then...</i>

8
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,559
<i>one of those wishes comes true.</i>

9
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:35,617
I don't wanna go to work.

10
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:37,947
It's warm in here.
It's a cocoon.

11
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:43,342
- No Cristina
with the mean face.
- No lives to save.

12
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:45,555
A quickie?

13
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:48,313
A quickie will
make me feel better.

14
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,416
You definitely need a quickie.

15
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:54,736
<i>So what then?</i>

16
00:00:54,838 --> 00:00:56,838
<i>Is it as good as we hoped?</i>

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,258
<i>Do we bask in the warm
glow of our happiness?</i>

18
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,678
<i>Or...</i>

19
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,798
<i>do we just notice we've
got a long list of other wishes</i>

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,100
<i>waiting to be wished?</i>

21
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:16,741
- Happy birthday.
- What? Oh. Yeah. Thank you.

22
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,477
OK, we gotta move
fast, people, so focus.

23
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,163
O'Malley, the pit. Karev,
you're with me. We got a surgery.

24
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:23,876
Stevens, clinic budget is due.

25
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,900
Yang, Grey, wait for the
Chief at the trauma bay.

26
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,712
- What? Why?
- Both of us?

27
00:01:27,738 --> 00:01:31,890
Yes, both of you. I don't know
what, I don't know why. Just go.

28
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:37,129
They're all silent rage-y.

29
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,398
- What do you got?
- Take a look.

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,316
So, what do we have?

31
00:01:42,586 --> 00:01:45,954
- Caldwell, as in the prison?
- Yeah.

32
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:48,623
- You read up on our VIP?
- Yes.

33
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:52,511
Multiple stab wounds, badly beaten.
He'll have guards with him at all times.

34
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,396
Cuffs stay on,
leg irons stay on.

35
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:57,816
Watch your syringes, sharps and
pens. I don't want any accidents.

36
00:02:00,804 --> 00:02:03,321
And he's here. You four
are my team. No interns.

37
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,201
Keep this as quiet as possible.

38
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:08,193
Get him in and out quickly.
Patch him up, get him on his way.

39
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,328
What's PDR?

40
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,040
Get him out of trauma
as fast as you can.

41
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,915
Those guards attract attention.

42
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,401
Sir, it's stamped
PDR. What is PDR?

43
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:17,886
Prisoner...

44
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:20,805
Death Row.

45
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:36,788
How's everybody
doing this morning?

46
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:45,580
- Mr. Dunn,
can you hear me?
- You have a lovely voice.

47
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:47,649
We need a trauma series.

48
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,938
I hate to be a bother, but
my legs really, really hurt.

49
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,025
- Was I stabbed in the leg?
- - We didn't find anything.

50
00:02:57,127 --> 00:02:59,278
- Add T-spine, L-spine films.
- We're getting a CT,

51
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,014
- extra films are a waste.
- More shots can't hurt.

52
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:04,833
If I wasn't stabbed, why
does it feel like I was?

53
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,596
The less you talk
the more we can work.

54
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,236
- Derek.
- That's OK.

55
00:03:08,338 --> 00:03:10,098
He'll warm up as we
get to know each other.

56
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,725
- I don't think so.
- You'll see. We're not that different.

57
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:19,547
People are alive when they meet
us, and then it all changes somehow.

58
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:30,008
Hi there.

59
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:33,044
What are you doing?

60
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,329
I'm saying hello.

61
00:03:34,431 --> 00:03:35,797
Listen.

62
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:38,983
My best friend made
one simple request,

63
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,531
that I not get anywhere
near you, and I slipped.

64
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,756
It was fantastic.
You're fantastic.

65
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,728
But it's not gonna
happen again, ever.

66
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,364
OK.

67
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,088
Damn it!

68
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,657
Yep. I think you broke your hip.

69
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:05,310
Are you kidding me?!

70
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,645
Come on!

71
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,948
- Who are you talking to?
- Last month,

72
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:14,052
I tripped and I cracked a rib. In April, I
fell in the shower and I broke my arm.

73
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:17,438
January, broke two
fingers doing yoga. Yoga!

74
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,191
This is my sixth break in a
year. So I stare at the heavens

75
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:23,629
and without belief in a higher
power but a need to blame someone,

76
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:25,847
I yell "Come freaking on!"

77
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:29,217
Tell you what: how about we
call ortho, have them run tests.

78
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:32,104
More satisfying than
shouting at the heavens.

79
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,879
Thank you.

80
00:04:35,592 --> 00:04:37,458
Ow.

81
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:43,381
Jackson Prescott,
you shot up again!

82
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,466
- No, I didn't.
- Then why do you look so big?

83
00:04:45,568 --> 00:04:48,870
- You're short.
- I've always been short,
you grew.

84
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:52,724
While I check Jackson, why don't you
take Melinda through today's procedure.

85
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,609
Yeah, no problem. Come on.

86
00:04:55,745 --> 00:04:57,662
Did you see he
looks more yellow?

87
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:01,299
OK, Dr. Kenley's going to
check his liver function test.

88
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,084
Before we start, let me explain.

89
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:05,704
Jackson's had 12
bowel resections.

90
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,206
Dr. Kenley calls me
any time Jackson's here.

91
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,342
Now, Melinda is a single mom.

92
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:13,978
She works like a maniac to make
sure that beautiful boy has coverage.

93
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,214
- Miranda...
- Don't even start.

94
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,751
This is a special family. We
do whatever we can to help.

95
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:24,623
- It's really not necessary...
- It is necessary.

96
00:05:25,609 --> 00:05:27,809
We'll take good
care of your kid.

97
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,411
Thank you.

98
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:33,431
Now let's talk
about the surgery.

99
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:38,603
Are you gonna let me
have a lollipop this time?

100
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:41,206
- My stomach's
not bad right now.
- It's not?

101
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,691
So how come I'm about
to cut a piece out of it?

102
00:05:43,794 --> 00:05:46,411
Give me one of the
lollipops, and if I keep it down

103
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,246
we don't have to
do the operation.

104
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,364
I'm not sure that's gonna...

105
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:52,467
I'm not...

106
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,336
- I'm...
- Dr. Kenley?

107
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,990
Jackson, hit the blue button.
Behind you. The blue button!

108
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,143
<i>- Code blue, second floor.</i>
- What...?

109
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:04,329
<i>Code blue, second floor.</i>

110
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:06,347
Oh, my God!

111
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,433
- What happened?
- He just fell over.

112
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,075
Sir...

113
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,478
I have some bad news.

114
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,648
It looks like Jordan Kenley
just had a massive coronary.

115
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,544
He was gone before
he hit the deck.

116
00:06:25,568 --> 00:06:28,086
His wife's on the way.

117
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:32,257
She'll probably want to speak to you,
the wife. Hear something reassuring.

118
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:35,576
He'll be missed.
Honored colleague.

119
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:38,012
Decades of service.

120
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,483
Sir, you in there?

121
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:49,690
Sir?

122
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:55,313
I have to tell Alex. About us.

123
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,299
"Us" us? No. That's a bad idea.

124
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:02,654
- That is monumentally bad.
- It's not fair. You know about him.

125
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,506
Yeah. I don't like it. And
if I could off him I would,

126
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:08,860
but he's the moody, broody
one, whereas I am mature and...

127
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:09,962
Dead.

128
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,696
You're dead.

129
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,482
I'm alive, and he's alive,

130
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:17,803
I'm happy when I'm with him.
Don't you want me to be happy?

131
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:21,673
Yes, there isn't anything in
this universe that I want more.

132
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,576
Why can't I have you both?
That's what makes me happy.

133
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,714
He's gonna think
you're a whackjob.

134
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:34,569
He told me that he loves me.

135
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:39,073
That's a huge deal for him.
The least I can do is be honest.

136
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,614
Sorry about your doc.

137
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,166
Whatever.

138
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:53,672
Dr. Kenley was gonna sign this,
before he died and everything.

139
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:56,207
- Can you?
- What is it?

140
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,610
I want to get a wish
from the wish people.

141
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:03,181
- You have to have
a doctor sign it.
- No. I'm not signing that.

142
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:06,918
Don't look at her, she's
not gonna sign it either.

143
00:08:07,003 --> 00:08:10,805
Come on. Look, if you sign,
you can help me pick my wish.

144
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:14,826
These are the ones kids have
already done, like go on a circus trapeze,

145
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:18,597
or be in the rodeo. Put stars by
the ones you think would be cool,

146
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,359
X's by the ones
you think are lame.

147
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:22,250
No way Kenley
was gonna sign that.

148
00:08:22,352 --> 00:08:26,637
It's for kids with life-threatening
diseases. You're not dying, just sick.

149
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,207
Dude...

150
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:32,894
The rodeo smells like horse
crap. You're not missing anything.

151
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:40,218
I think we've got a parathyroid
tumor for you to remove.

152
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,954
- Really.
- Did I just hear tumor removal?

153
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,857
My resident abandoned
me. Do you need any help?

154
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,203
- Sure.
- No!

155
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,960
Or... Fine, but you'll watch.

156
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:53,899
You're not touching
anything. Get it? No touching.

157
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,786
Uh, she's up in ultrasound.
Call and see if they took her yet.

158
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,844
- You slept with her?
- Absolutely not!

159
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,863
Only once.

160
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,566
She came to my hotel room, took
off all her clothes and said teach me.

161
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:15,736
I had no control. She violated
me with her nakedness.

162
00:09:15,838 --> 00:09:17,471
Derek's gonna kill me.

163
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:20,641
- Shouldn't have
been alone with her.
- Never gonna happen again,

164
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:24,862
- mind-blowingly
fantastic as it was.
- Hey, you are a professional.

165
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,415
Hi! Oh, hold on.

166
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,785
Hold tight.

167
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:33,454
Just a bit of lint.
Ultrasound's backed up,

168
00:09:33,556 --> 00:09:36,107
but they'll have
results in half an hour.

169
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:40,378
All right. Well, tell Grey.

170
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,315
And let George... Dr. George...

171
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,152
Dr. O'Malley know when... Let
him know when you know, OK?

172
00:09:50,073 --> 00:09:53,391
You were saying something
about professionalism.

173
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:56,193
Did you see that? That
was not in my head, right?

174
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,462
These interns
are out of control.

175
00:09:58,548 --> 00:10:01,850
- Stalkers.
- Sexed-up stalkers.

176
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:05,337
Dr. Bailey? Arizona Robbins.

177
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,190
- I'm taking over
Dr. Kenley's patients.
- You're the peds surgeon?

178
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:11,259
You're assisting
with Jackson Prescott.

179
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:15,180
All due respect to Dr. Kenley,
he was a wonderful physician.

180
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,248
I'm surprised he
followed this treatment

181
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,086
when it wasn't,
you know, working.

182
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:23,905
I'm not criticizing you.
You didn't make the call.

183
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:27,391
But I supported the call. We
hadn't turned the corner yet,

184
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,845
but Kenley was sure that if we
kept doing what we were doing...

185
00:10:30,947 --> 00:10:33,181
- Jack's case is quite severe...
- Jackson.

186
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:35,833
- Excuse me?
- Jackson is his name.

187
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:39,904
And if you're suggesting we were
torturing him with useless procedures...

188
00:10:39,989 --> 00:10:43,791
A lot of senior peds surgeons
believe that strictureplasty works,

189
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,694
and sometimes they're
right. So we'll go with it today,

190
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:50,047
but we should start
exploring other options.

191
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:54,619
I gotta run. Dr. Kenley had a
big case load. See you in the OR.

192
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:02,327
He's still in a lot of
pain, I'm not sure why.

193
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,290
It'll help if we get
him off this backboard.

194
00:11:04,314 --> 00:11:07,782
Shouldn't we wait for X-rays?
Decreased sensation in his lower extremity.

195
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:10,351
According to him. He
could tell you anything.

196
00:11:10,454 --> 00:11:12,787
We pushed morphine. He
shouldn't be in this much pain.

197
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,289
Maybe we could
push a teeny bit more?

198
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:17,002
Not here to feed
your drug habit.

199
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:18,993
I've been behind
bars for 11 years.

200
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,480
The drug trade in solitary
isn't what one would hope.

201
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:25,216
- Let's just wait for the films.
- This is a waste of time.

202
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:29,170
I hate to agree with Yang,
but I agree with Yang.

203
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,272
Dr. Grey?

204
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,013
Dr. Shepherd?

205
00:11:40,683 --> 00:11:41,866
What's that?

206
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,984
Whatever they stabbed
him with is in there.

207
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:46,554
- In his back?
- Spine.

208
00:11:46,656 --> 00:11:50,191
Does that mean I'm paralyzed?

209
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:55,279
My execution date is in a week.

210
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:59,066
I've exhausted all my
appeals. But if I'm paralyzed,

211
00:11:59,168 --> 00:12:02,987
my lawyer might be able to make
a case for staying my execution.

212
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,573
Do you think you
could let me be a gimp?

213
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,209
No.

214
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,549
Is the Chief in there?
I need to see him.

215
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,206
So do I. We're going
to be disappointed.

216
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,526
What exactly is
he doing in there?

217
00:12:24,628 --> 00:12:26,694
Ever since he heard
about Jordan Kenley,

218
00:12:26,796 --> 00:12:29,563
he's been in there and
he wants to be alone.

219
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,117
I need to see...!

220
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:39,223
It's impinging on the spinal cord.
Can't tell if it's going through or not.

221
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:42,060
We'll get a better picture
once we get the CTs back.

222
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:45,496
I ordered an MRI. The CT may
not give us a clear view of the cord.

223
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,531
We'll look at all the images.

224
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,673
Everything by the book. I don't
want some lawyer keeping him alive

225
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:53,087
on the basis we did not
give him the standard of care.

226
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,356
- You're pro-death penalty?
- Pro-punishment.

227
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,876
Good people do bad
things. People screw up.

228
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:01,512
He's still a person. We don't
know what crime he committed.

229
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,643
Maybe he killed a cop. Feel
all warm for the cop killer.

230
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:06,518
We don't know what
he did. We can't judge.

231
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:09,487
No, but a jury can. Death row.

232
00:13:09,572 --> 00:13:12,222
We're wasting time
debating this. Do a repeat crit,

233
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:14,308
let me know if he needs blood.

234
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:20,031
- I thought they were friends.
- They were.

235
00:13:20,116 --> 00:13:24,919
- And now?
- You and I are in
for a very long day.

236
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:27,371
The annoying twins
got a mass murderer.

237
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,857
Think one will pay
the guy to off the other?

238
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:32,655
No. If they're gonna get
violent, they'll do it themselves.

239
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:36,747
- It's weird, right? Them fighting?
- Um...

240
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:41,535
There's something that I need to talk
to you about, it's gonna sound weird.

241
00:13:41,638 --> 00:13:44,083
And I want you to know
I know it sounds weird,

242
00:13:44,107 --> 00:13:46,991
- so just don't freak out.
- Are you breaking up with me?

243
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:49,710
- No, not at all.
- Though that's not a bad idea.

244
00:13:49,812 --> 00:13:53,698
I see Denny. A lot, lately.

245
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,768
Around here, and at the house.

246
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,839
Are you OK? 'Cause that
sounds kind of whacked.

247
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,056
What did I tell you?

248
00:14:02,158 --> 00:14:04,642
You never saw your
grandmother after she died?

249
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:09,380
Yeah, she showed up in a dream
and told me not to play with the parts.

250
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:13,084
Well, it's kind of like that.

251
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,119
- Excuse me?
- All right. Whatever.

252
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,754
That's it?

253
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,457
I don't know.
Tell him I said hi.

254
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:25,179
Kind of like his grandmother
telling him not to...

255
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,148
OK, so I panicked!

256
00:14:28,251 --> 00:14:31,002
Mr. Dunn, are you
feeling any better?

257
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:33,104
Everybody's been so attentive.

258
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,023
I'm still in a lot of pain.

259
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,393
We're gonna get that thing out
of your back as soon as we can.

260
00:14:39,495 --> 00:14:41,412
You're on the cord.

261
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:47,201
She's kind of a bitch.

262
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:50,972
Not to use coarse
language, but she is.

263
00:14:51,073 --> 00:14:54,809
- Well, she's my friend.
- Really?

264
00:14:54,911 --> 00:14:56,994
We had a fight.

265
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:00,931
Mr. Dunn, it will really
help us when we take it out

266
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:03,217
if we know what that
thing in your back is.

267
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,470
I'm pretty sure it
was a toothbrush.

268
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,138
Somebody snapped the
head off and melted it down

269
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,526
till it was less toothbrush
and more knife.

270
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:16,814
How did it end up in your spine?

271
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,450
Got in a fight with a friend.

272
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:25,873
Hey, lady!

273
00:15:27,444 --> 00:15:30,478
- Can you help me?
- Sure.

274
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,196
- You feeling OK?
- Yeah.

275
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,165
You see, I'm gonna get a
wish from the wish people,

276
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,069
but I'm having trouble
deciding which wish to pick.

277
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:41,738
I'm getting people's opinions.
Put stars by the ones you like

278
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:45,993
and X's by the ones you think are
lame. Then you have to sign something.

279
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:49,597
OK. How about a trip to
China? That sounds cool.

280
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,632
- I get airsick.
- Hmm.

281
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:54,868
- How about the rodeo?
- Some guy said
it smells like poo.

282
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,838
What the hell are you doing?

283
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:59,173
Stars and X's.
We're picking wishes.

284
00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:01,892
He's not even eligible.
You're a little scammer.

285
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:04,662
- You're fake dying?
- I want to go to the rodeo!

286
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:07,214
You just told me
it smells like poo!

287
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:09,200
Nice try.

288
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,136
Come on, let's get you
prepped for surgery.

289
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:19,910
You told him. He
knows. Stop worrying.

290
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:26,300
You've got a tumor on a
little gland in your neck.

291
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,887
Come on!

292
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:34,207
She does that. Margaret,
the tumor is benign

293
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,644
and it's not hard to
remove. Dr. Harris?

294
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:40,565
A parathyroid tumor tells your body
to leech calcium out of your bones.

295
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,099
That's why you've had fractures.

296
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,669
Once the tumor's out,
you'll be back to normal.

297
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,424
Come on!

298
00:16:50,526 --> 00:16:52,838
- This is good news.
- I've been living
like an old lady.

299
00:16:52,862 --> 00:16:57,181
I don't take the stairs, I
gave up running, skiing.

300
00:16:57,283 --> 00:17:00,050
I sit and knit and hope the
knitting doesn't break a finger.

301
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:04,655
- All because of a tumor?
- Tumor that's benign,
easy to remove.

302
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,691
Come on!

303
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,377
There was a guy.

304
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:15,783
I fell in love with the
most amazing guy.

305
00:17:15,885 --> 00:17:18,936
He was sweet, kind,
best sex of my life

306
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,521
and he had to move to Denver.

307
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,456
And he wanted me
to move with him.

308
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:27,495
And I didn't because Denver is icy.
Too many ways for me to slip and fall.

309
00:17:27,597 --> 00:17:31,599
So I lose my guy and I break all these
bones from a bone-sucking tumor?!

310
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:33,667
Are you kidding me?!

311
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:36,254
Sorry. From the lab, Dr. Sloan.

312
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,161
Did you need something else?

313
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:48,181
- This is torture.
- Focus.

314
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:50,618
OK. Karev, can you
pull the retractor more?

315
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,221
- Like that?
- Yeah. Great.

316
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,674
Damn. Look at this. It's a mess.

317
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,961
He'll have maybe 10 centimeters
of bowel when we're done.

318
00:18:01,063 --> 00:18:04,175
Can't we try a Bianchi procedure,
see if we can save more of it?

319
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:07,267
Bowel's dead and the liver's
cirrhotic. No saving anything.

320
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:09,186
But...

321
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:13,490
He should have been on a transplant list a
year ago. It's a miracle he's still alive.

322
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:26,737
What are...

323
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,049
What are you doing?

324
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,408
I'm not seeing
anyone today, Bailey.

325
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,610
I know that, but
this is important.

326
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,029
Every conversation
I have is important.

327
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:39,266
Kenley has been replaced with an
infant on roller skates named Arizona,

328
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:42,102
who didn't have sense
enough to change her name,

329
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,222
which shows poor judgment,
as does her diagnosis of a patient

330
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,765
that I've been working
with for three years.

331
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,478
She's changing Kenley's
treatment protocol

332
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,497
based on half an hour of
experience with the child.

333
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,233
We just took out
most of his bowel,

334
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,752
and instead of trying to
salvage what he has left,

335
00:18:58,854 --> 00:19:02,139
she wants to throw up her
hands and pray for a transplant.

336
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,525
The child hasn't eaten
solid food in months.

337
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:07,612
He hasn't grown in
years. His liver is shot.

338
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:09,446
It is a serious case!

339
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:12,266
Now we need someone
who can handle it.

340
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,919
Dr. Bailey...

341
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,139
you thought Shepherd
was just a haircut.

342
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,141
You didn't like Hahn,

343
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:26,363
and you think
Dr. Sloan is a hussy.

344
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,449
Can you name any attending
that you thought was good?

345
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,838
I've always been
a fan of your work.

346
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:40,144
Arizona Robbins was
top of her class, like you.

347
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,829
And she was chief
resident, like you.

348
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:46,417
And she's the best anyone's
seen in a long time, just like you.

349
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,871
She is who we have, we don't
have anyone else. Deal with it.

350
00:20:07,756 --> 00:20:09,023
What's that for?

351
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,109
You're short of a friend
today. So I thought I'd fill in.

352
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,928
Colleagues aren't
friends, they're competitors.

353
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,981
Oh. So does that mean you're
not gonna drink this coffee?

354
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:20,668
No. I'll drink the coffee.

355
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:26,857
MRI. He's got brain contusions
on top of everything else.

356
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:32,129
Mr. Dunn is still in a
huge amount of pain.

357
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,199
Can I give him more morphine
or will that cause problems?

358
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,212
Mr. Dunn has had
enough morphine.

359
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,920
He's got a foreign
body in his spine.

360
00:20:40,022 --> 00:20:42,539
- It's inhumane.
- Killing people is inhumane.

361
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,409
Denying them painkillers
is a judgment call.

362
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:50,564
Derek, what's wrong with you?

363
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,850
I watch people die all the time.

364
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:58,188
I go to families and tell them their
world's been ripped apart all the time.

365
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,124
I fight to make sure I don't
have to deliver that message

366
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:04,328
and I lose that
fight all the time.

367
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:09,567
Then some guy like Dunn comes
along and simply throws it away. Life.

368
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:14,204
Then he's got the nerve to tell me he
and I are two sides of the same coin?

369
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,956
You're not.

370
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:18,909
He doesn't need morphine.

371
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,296
But she's exquisite.

372
00:21:22,398 --> 00:21:27,151
And it's not just the sex. We
talked for hours, and laughed.

373
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:28,519
It's just the sex.

374
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,555
You're gonna tell me you're
not thinking about Sadie?

375
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:34,842
Nope. No.

376
00:21:34,943 --> 00:21:38,645
I cannot have another stupid
romantic disaster in this hospital.

377
00:21:38,747 --> 00:21:41,966
- It's embarrassing.
- You do have quite
a track record.

378
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:46,353
You know what? We need to
find something else to think about.

379
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,089
Worth a try.

380
00:21:54,864 --> 00:21:56,496
Nope, not working.

381
00:21:56,598 --> 00:21:57,697
Nope.

382
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,600
OK. Ooh, OK!

383
00:21:59,702 --> 00:22:03,537
We're like addicts, right?
We need a 12-step program.

384
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:05,989
I'm not going to a meeting
to discuss my obsession

385
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,091
with my friend's
girlfriend's half sister.

386
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,644
It'll just be us. We'll be
each other's sponsors.

387
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:14,665
- Make sure we stay
on the program.
- What are the steps?

388
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,144
Don't get naked with an intern.

389
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:25,192
It's more of a one-step program.

390
00:22:25,294 --> 00:22:27,389
- Maybe I should
write this down.
- Yeah.

391
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:32,199
Hey, Cristina, can you mention
that it's Izzie's birthday today?

392
00:22:32,301 --> 00:22:34,251
Someone should do
something about it.

393
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:38,222
I myself am planning a
party with balloons, streamers,

394
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:40,440
- and a bouncy house.
- You know what?

395
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:44,294
- Alex should do something.
- I know. I got it under control.

396
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,630
Bouncy house?

397
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,602
Is he here?

398
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,121
Who?

399
00:22:54,857 --> 00:22:57,057
Your friend.

400
00:22:57,159 --> 00:22:58,558
No. He's not here.

401
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,940
If he shows up, tell him I'll share
my girl, but not my sandwich.

402
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,131
This thing cost four bucks.

403
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:15,709
Oh, I'm done here.

404
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,611
Dude from MRI was all
freaked out about death row guy.

405
00:23:18,714 --> 00:23:21,732
Couldn't put his cuffs in the
machine, They had to Velcro him.

406
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:24,668
Tech thought he was gonna
tear it off and storm the booth

407
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:27,187
- like the Hulk or something.
- What did he do?

408
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:29,156
He laid there and had that MRI.

409
00:23:29,258 --> 00:23:33,360
No. What did he do
to get on death row,

410
00:23:33,462 --> 00:23:35,479
mow down people
with a machine gun?

411
00:23:35,564 --> 00:23:37,342
Probably found his wife with
a hooker and a handyman.

412
00:23:37,366 --> 00:23:39,717
They don't give the death
penalty for crimes of passion.

413
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:42,380
- People understand that.
- All crimes are crimes
of passion.

414
00:23:42,404 --> 00:23:46,890
People don't do stuff like that
because they forget it's illegal.

415
00:23:51,546 --> 00:23:56,516
When you kill her, is it
gonna be a crime of passion?

416
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:59,270
- That still hasn't blown over?
- It's not a big deal.

417
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:01,133
We had a fight.
She took it too far.

418
00:24:01,157 --> 00:24:04,158
- You want to know what I think?
- Not really.

419
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,895
Hey.

420
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:12,266
I need to scream or kill someone.
I'm leaning towards killing.

421
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:13,834
Working.

422
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,474
I'm feeling much better, thanks.

423
00:24:20,576 --> 00:24:24,462
Thank you for whatever
it was you gave me.

424
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:29,467
Is there family or someone who
should know you're having surgery?

425
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:34,087
We can't call your family. I
think what she's trying to ask is,

426
00:24:34,189 --> 00:24:37,090
- what did you do
to get death row?
- You don't have to answer that.

427
00:24:37,192 --> 00:24:39,792
- That was not
what I was asking.
- I don't mind.

428
00:24:39,829 --> 00:24:42,729
It's an obvious question.

429
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,985
One Monday, I slit
this woman's throat.

430
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:54,975
I'd been thinking about it
for a while, dreaming about it.

431
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:58,095
And one Monday, I just...

432
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:00,898
I had to do it.

433
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,203
I just... really wanted to
draw a knife across her neck.

434
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:11,275
And I thought it
would be terrifying

435
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:14,611
or sad or something,

436
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:17,581
but it wasn't, it was just...

437
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:21,385
kind of fun.

438
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:28,025
So I did two more on Tuesday
and another two on Wednesday.

439
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:31,562
I was gonna go for three on
Thursday, I liked the alliteration,

440
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:34,130
but I got caught so I didn't.

441
00:25:38,154 --> 00:25:39,703
Can I get some Jell-O?

442
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:44,157
Or is that bad, before surgery?

443
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:57,121
- Read the sign!
- I was told to ignore the sign.

444
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,789
- Well, don't!
- Bailey told me.

445
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,360
I'm gonna kill that woman.

446
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:11,802
Look, I didn't know
Kenley all that well,

447
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,820
but it's gotta be tough.

448
00:26:13,922 --> 00:26:16,284
Losing a co-worker you've
worked with for a long time.

449
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,425
Jordan Kenley
was a son of a bitch.

450
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:21,911
Great with kids, good with a
scalpel. Horrible to his colleagues.

451
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:25,915
Competitive, insecure, aggressive.
I won't miss him for a minute.

452
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:30,120
So... is this about
your mortality?

453
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,830
I'm not worried about me
dying or Jordan Kenley dying.

454
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:48,322
I'm worried about
my hospital dying.

455
00:26:48,424 --> 00:26:51,024
I made some calls
to replace Kenley.

456
00:26:51,126 --> 00:26:52,993
No one wants to come here.

457
00:26:53,095 --> 00:26:58,031
I can't keep a cardiac surgeon on staff.
Burke quit, Hahn quit, Dixon's autistic.

458
00:26:58,133 --> 00:27:01,267
My OR roof collapsed,
the whole place flooded.

459
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:04,037
The interns are literally
chopping each other into pieces.

460
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:07,257
No wonder we're
number 12. Twelve!

461
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:14,247
I've failed at the one thing
I spent my whole life doing.

462
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,566
Failed!

463
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:21,538
So I'm going to stay
right here on this table

464
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,642
until I find a way to walk
the halls without cringing.

465
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:38,639
Aren't you supposed to give me
that "get back on the horse" lecture?

466
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:42,525
I have got to stitch a serial
killer back together today.

467
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,646
I don't have a
rousing lecture in me.

468
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:09,686
We're gonna need a strategy. Their
hot little eyes tracking our every move.

469
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:13,240
OK. No casual glances
over the shoulder.

470
00:28:13,342 --> 00:28:15,776
No "this is interesting,
can everybody see?"

471
00:28:15,878 --> 00:28:17,561
Soon as Margaret's tumor's out,

472
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:20,297
we'll have them take it to
pathology to get it analyzed.

473
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,682
- Go team.
- Break.

474
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,842
- They still not speaking?
- Doesn't look like it.

475
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:36,780
- Wow. Two hours in an ice cave.
- Working on Seattle's man of
the year.

476
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,882
At least we got each other.

477
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:42,152
We can pretend not to notice,
talk about the Seahawks.

478
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:45,655
Or we could take off, go grab a
beer, let them pull out the shiv.

479
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,841
Onward and upward.

480
00:28:53,382 --> 00:28:56,900
I don't think I was clear
earlier. It is not like a dream.

481
00:28:57,002 --> 00:29:00,470
I see Denny when I'm
awake. We hang out.

482
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,290
This is because I said I
loved you. You're freaked out.

483
00:29:03,391 --> 00:29:05,992
- I'm not.
- You're a little freaked out.

484
00:29:06,762 --> 00:29:11,748
Um, we still do stuff together.

485
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:17,687
Sex stuff. I see him,
and we have sex.

486
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:22,158
There's nothing wrong
with a good fantasy.

487
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,729
I'd rather you fantasize
about me, or chicks.

488
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:29,382
- But whatever.
- You really don't care?

489
00:29:29,484 --> 00:29:31,579
You're trying to
work something out.

490
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:35,272
People die, and then the
other people, you know...

491
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:37,190
get messed up about it.

492
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:38,772
- Yeah, but...
- Iz.

493
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,361
I've been competing with
that tool for a long time,

494
00:29:41,463 --> 00:29:44,114
but I'd say he's kinda
got the handicap now.

495
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:47,734
I mean, is he here?
Can he see me do this?

496
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:51,104
Yeah, dude, I can see you!

497
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:53,974
And this?

498
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,063
Is he still here?

499
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:03,633
- I think you should go.
- Yeah, I got things to do.

500
00:30:06,288 --> 00:30:07,568
Do you see him now?

501
00:30:07,623 --> 00:30:11,157
No. No, he's gone. Don't stop.

502
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:13,476
- Don't stop!
- What about now?

503
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:14,744
No, don't stop!

504
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:24,221
Wow. Sharp.

505
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,351
No wonder he was
complaining so much.

506
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:28,909
He wasn't complaining after
he got 10 extra of morphine.

507
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,322
He got an extra 10 of morphine?

508
00:30:30,346 --> 00:30:32,245
It made him much
more comfortable.

509
00:30:32,347 --> 00:30:35,376
Doesn't bother you this guy probably
hacked a family with a machete?

510
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:40,119
A knife. And women, not a family.
Five women. It's what he likes.

511
00:30:40,221 --> 00:30:42,589
You shouldn't be on
this case, either of you.

512
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:46,660
What's he gonna do, jump off the
table and get us? You're holding the knife.

513
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:53,283
We'll be doing a nephrectomy. Either
of you ever mobilized the renal hilum?

514
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:55,146
Never done one,
but I'd love to try.

515
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,720
I've practiced on
cadavers hundreds of times.

516
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,973
It wouldn't be my first try.

517
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:03,627
To some of us surgery comes
naturally. Others have to practice.

518
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,404
You see the Seahawks
game last week?

519
00:31:17,993 --> 00:31:23,413
- You know,
I am the jealous type.
- I know. I'm sorry.

520
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:26,916
I can't choose. Please
don't make me choose.

521
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,021
Are you gonna make me?

522
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:34,791
I can't do anything that
would make you unhappy.

523
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,893
You know that.

524
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,415
I love you.

525
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:46,252
That's what you
tell all the guys.

526
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:51,207
You know today is my birthday?

527
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,262
I do know that.

528
00:31:55,364 --> 00:31:58,181
You gonna get me a present?

529
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,653
I think I just did.

530
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:18,668
- Why is she shaking her head?
- Jackson's post-op LFTs.

531
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,205
This kid needs to be put
on the transplant list today.

532
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,050
- Just the intestine...?
- Liver too.

533
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:26,109
We should get another opinion.

534
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,820
Norman McCale at Hopkins.
Head of Pediatric Surgery.

535
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:40,223
Tell him Arizona sent you. When he
tells you Jackson needs a transplant,

536
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:43,576
which he'll do two minutes
into the call, put him on the list.

537
00:32:43,678 --> 00:32:46,630
- There's no need to snap at me.
- There is, actually.

538
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:49,215
You've been
second-guessing me. I get it.

539
00:32:49,317 --> 00:32:52,251
You liked Dr. Kenley. And
I'm a stranger with a ponytail.

540
00:32:52,353 --> 00:32:54,954
But I'm not the
problem, the patient is.

541
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,940
So stop thinking about me
and start focusing on him.

542
00:32:58,043 --> 00:33:03,162
Jackson needs a transplant. If we keep
wasting time, he's not going to make it.

543
00:33:34,563 --> 00:33:37,380
You OK? Want to get
a drink or something?

544
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:41,284
Oh, now we're on again,
'cause the mood suits you?

545
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,620
I'm the sad little
girl with no friend?

546
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:46,023
I tripped your savior
complex into action?

547
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:49,992
Usually, I can deal with the
hot and cold thing, but not today.

548
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:56,099
Just leave me the hell alone.

549
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:15,268
Is that him?

550
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:19,222
- You ever find out what he did?
- It doesn't matter what he did.

551
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:23,726
He did something really
bad, and he's gonna pay for it.

552
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:29,516
- You want to get a drink?
- I'm not in the mood.

553
00:34:34,188 --> 00:34:36,823
You know, you and I
had a fight like this once.

554
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:41,077
- What?
- Amsterdam.

555
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,948
We used to be as close as you and
Cristina, then Amsterdam happened.

556
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,734
You shut me down.
We never got past it.

557
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,403
We still hung out,
but not like before.

558
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,940
We'd go dancing. Go someplace
loud, where we don't have to talk.

559
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:57,727
That's OK. I'm a
rolling stone, I bounce.

560
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:02,348
But you're about to do the same thing
to Cristina, and that girl mates for life.

561
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:06,502
If you don't make it right,
she'll never talk to you again.

562
00:35:08,623 --> 00:35:11,791
I apologized. To Cristina.

563
00:35:13,762 --> 00:35:15,327
Like you meant it?

564
00:35:16,297 --> 00:35:19,165
Like you could imagine
she had a point?

565
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:26,238
I miss you.

566
00:35:27,175 --> 00:35:29,542
As my friend, I miss you.

567
00:35:33,848 --> 00:35:36,700
Now transplants aren't
easy, that's the bad news.

568
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,502
But the good news is,

569
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:42,989
you've got a
crackerjack new doctor.

570
00:35:43,091 --> 00:35:46,426
I spoke to one of the most
respected kid surgeons in the country,

571
00:35:46,528 --> 00:35:48,377
and he thinks she's
the best there is.

572
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,781
So she's gonna take good
care of you. We all are.

573
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,126
Why don't we go out and sign
some of the transplant consent forms?

Looking good. The surgery
couldn't have been smoother.

586
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,048
- When could I get out of here?
- Soon.

587
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:01,433
- You're young,
you'll heal fast.
- Eager to get home?

588
00:37:03,939 --> 00:37:06,556
I'm going to Denver.

589
00:37:17,285 --> 00:37:20,720
- We did good work today.
- If we stay strong...

590
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:24,407
- And don't get drunk...
- Keep staring at Joe,
we'll be fine.

591
00:37:27,061 --> 00:37:29,929
Hi! Get you anything?

592
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:39,706
- OK, you're weirding me out.
- You only live once.

593
00:37:39,808 --> 00:37:41,691
You can't waste it.

594
00:37:44,612 --> 00:37:47,096
No! No, Mark. No!

595
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:49,081
Look at Joe. Look at me.

596
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,750
Look at me. No!

597
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:55,822
- Sorry, kid. I'm going to Denver.
- No! Mark, come back here!

598
00:37:55,924 --> 00:37:58,358
No, Mark, no!

599
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,326
Damn it. Damn
it, damn it, damn it!

600
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:22,515
- You need another drink?
- Yes!

601
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:36,179
She's all right.
Arizona Robbins.

602
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:38,648
Mm-hmm.

603
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:42,284
I don't know if the patient's
going to make it, though.

604
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:57,367
<i>We don't wish
for the easy stuff.</i>

605
00:38:58,553 --> 00:39:00,670
<i>We wish for big things.</i>

606
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,908
<i>Things that are ambitious...</i>

607
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:08,044
<i>out of reach.</i>

608
00:39:16,838 --> 00:39:18,388
Let's take a look.

609
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,995
He's got 10...

610
00:39:43,565 --> 00:39:48,500
Two guys shot my
dad for his watch.

611
00:39:48,602 --> 00:39:51,387
My mom saved up for it.

612
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:55,925
Two guys came into his store and
shot him 'cause he wouldn't give it up.

613
00:39:57,796 --> 00:40:00,195
That's how my dad died.

614
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,950
We are supposed to
treat everybody the same.

615
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:08,287
But they're not all the same.

616
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:15,111
I'm sorry. It's a bad
day all around, I guess.

617
00:40:18,366 --> 00:40:21,717
I wish I could make things
better with you and Cristina.

618
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:24,837
I wish you could, too.

619
00:40:24,939 --> 00:40:28,090
I try to think what she would
do, in a situation like this.

620
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,310
I don't know.

621
00:40:31,313 --> 00:40:34,180
Well, she would turn
the music up pretty loud

622
00:40:34,282 --> 00:40:38,234
and she would dance it out with me,
but I don't think you want to go there.

623
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:39,786
Well...

624
00:40:41,222 --> 00:40:43,155
let's see what we got here.

625
00:40:46,994 --> 00:40:50,729
Whoo! Yeah! Look out!

626
00:40:50,831 --> 00:40:53,516
Hey! Come on, get up!

627
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:56,286

Oh, my God! You made it.

Well, the cake tastes kind of

It's a nice gesture,
him baking for you.

643
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:49,188
Make a wish.

644
00:41:52,393 --> 00:41:54,593
What if I don't have
anything to wish for?

645
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:58,130
What if I have everything
I could ever want?

646
00:41:58,232 --> 00:42:00,283
<i>We still wish, though.</i>

647
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:03,269
