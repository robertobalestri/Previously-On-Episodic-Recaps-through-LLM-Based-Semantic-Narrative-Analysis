1
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:08,707
Come on.

2
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,010
Come on, come on...

3
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,712
Ow! Damn it.

4
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:16,998
<i>Any first year med student knows</i>

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,818
<i>that an increased heart
rate is a sign of trouble.</i>

6
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,956
- All day of this.
- Stuck with Stevens.

7
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:26,236
Why are we in a clinic?

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,209
I thought we're
supposed to be surgeons.

9
00:00:28,312 --> 00:00:31,897
Not today we're not. Today's
gonna be about flu shots.

10
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:35,317
- And enemas.
- What a colossal waste of time.

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,552
Morning.

12
00:00:37,654 --> 00:00:40,406
<i>A racing heart could
indicate anything...</i>

13
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:44,342
<i>from a panic disorder...</i>

14
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,494
- Oh, God! Sorry!
- No, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:46,596 --> 00:00:49,448
I... No, I didn't
even look, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,150
Where...? No, no.
I'll leave. I'll leave.

17
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:55,471
No. Sleep. You've
been here all night.

18
00:00:56,923 --> 00:01:00,692
Uh... How did you know
I've been here all night?

19
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,463
<i>To something much...</i>

20
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,247
I just knew.

21
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:09,952
<i>Much more serious.</i>

22
00:01:10,054 --> 00:01:11,820
<i>♪ You got me stuck to you ♪</i>

23
00:01:11,922 --> 00:01:13,688
<i>♪ You got me stuck to you ♪</i>

24
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,123
<i>♪ You got me stuck to you ♪</i>

25
00:01:15,226 --> 00:01:18,877
You should wear
your hair up more.

26
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,613
Shows off the back of your neck.

27
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:25,564
I like the back of your neck.

28
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:30,255
<i>♪ If you a case I be a jury ♪</i>

29
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,709
<i>♪ If you a sin I be your mercy ♪</i>

00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:38,113
<i>♪ If you the beat

31
00:01:38,215 --> 00:01:40,682
<i>A heart that flutters...</i>

32
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,252
<i>or one that skips a beat...</i>

33
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,487
Hey. I thought
you were sleeping.

34
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,524
- Hunt was in the on-call room.
- You had dirty sex with Hunt?

35
00:01:49,626 --> 00:01:53,227
No. It's not dirty
and it's not sex. It's...

36
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:56,815
- I don't know what it is.
<i>- Could be sign - of secret affliction.</i>

37
00:01:56,917 --> 00:02:00,301
- Hey, how's it going?
- Oh, my God. Thank you for asking.

38
00:02:00,404 --> 00:02:03,338
It's great. I mean,
he's fun and funny.

39
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,674
Even with no sex
allowed, we just laugh.

40
00:02:05,776 --> 00:02:08,443
- We talk...
- I don't want to hear this.

41
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,396
Come on! But you have to!
You're the only one who knows.

42
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:14,232
I'm terrible at keeping
secrets. It makes me sick.

43
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,429
Alone people don't like to
hear about together people.

44
00:02:16,453 --> 00:02:19,238
Even if alone people are
alone by choice. It's mean.

45
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,500
It's like bringing a six
pack to an AA meeting.

46
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,041
Keep it to yourself.

47
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:25,927
I am.

48
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:28,062
I need a favor. My
mother's ninth journal.

49
00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:30,048
- I need you to pre-read it.
- Why?

50
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,483
She had an affair
with the chief.

51
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,964
Your mother had an affair
with her chief resident?

52
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:36,638
- Rock on, Ellis.
- No, no, no. Not her chief.

53
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,955
Our chief.

54
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,821
Yeah, you'll go
blind reading that.

55
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:45,447
<i>Or it could indicate romance...</i>

56
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,984
<i>which is the
biggest trouble of all.</i>

57
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,603
- Whoa. What is that?
- What you think it is.

58
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,539
Dangerous. People who
carry guns are likely to fire.

59
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,775
I'm ready to fire it. She's the
problem. She spooks easy.

60
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,595
I have to fire at the right
time, in the right way,

61
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,630
or she'll panic and bolt.

62
00:03:02,732 --> 00:03:04,277
She's not ready.
Think she's ready?

63
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:06,602
I don't know. More importantly,

64
00:03:06,704 --> 00:03:08,637
if you don't know,
don't do anything.

65
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:11,656
- Dr. Sloan.
- Dr. Hunt.

66
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:15,460
Let's make this quick.

67
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,836
- So we're good to go?
- Yep. Use it wisely.

68
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,307
- Hey. I'm with you today.
- What's going on

69
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,926
- with you and Mark?
- What? Nothing.

70
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:33,928
Why? What did
you think is... was?

71
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:36,281
You've been on his
service for over a week.

72
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,816
Yeah, I'm really
interested in Plastics.

73
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,053
As a specialty. Fascinated.

74
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:44,739
- I like faces.
- Mmm-hmm.

75
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:46,041
Vehicular blunt trauma,

76
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,059
right shoulder
stabilized in the field.

77
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:52,063
- Somebody help us! Please!
- Jen, slow down. We're here.

78
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:55,234
Can you help my husband?
I ran him over with the car!

79
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:57,869
Sweetie, sweetie.
You have to calm down.

80
00:03:57,972 --> 00:03:59,816
- I'm gonna be fine.
- OK. I'm calm.

81
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,274
- I'm calm. I'm calm.
- All right.

82
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,750
Oh, my God. That's my
stupid pregnant brain!

83
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,986
I left the car in drive.
Baby, I'm so sorry.

84
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:18,272
- It's a normal neuro exam.
- He's got an inferior

85
00:04:18,374 --> 00:04:21,727
shoulder dislocation and
fractures. You'll need surgery.

86
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,356
Sloan will débride
burns in surgery.

87
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,457
Surgery? Oh, baby!

88
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:29,117
- Her BP is 170 over 100.
- Give her five of hydralazine.

89
00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:31,036
- Calm down. How's the baby?
- Kicking.

90
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,938
- Pressing right on my bladder.
- Look on the bright side.

91
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,324
She's not running
you over with a truck.

92
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:39,193
Hey, you wanted the SUV, right?

93
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,163
Pregnancy-induced hypertension?

94
00:04:41,265 --> 00:04:43,214
Yeah, I have to get
her BP down before

95
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,249
- it affects the baby.
- Nice couple.

96
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:50,288
- They'll have cute kids.
- Not as cute as ours, but cute.

97
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,508
- What?
- Nothing.

98
00:05:00,617 --> 00:05:03,769
It's been three days.
Three days of vacation.

99
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,755
The only days I've taken,
other than my maternity leave.

100
00:05:06,857 --> 00:05:09,858
- I know I'm behind, but...
- Bailey, I get it.

101
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,644
Jackson Prescott
was not an easy case.

102
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:17,098
Frankly, sir, I would rather not
work on another dying kid again.

103
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,118
But no need to worry.
I will catch up and I...

104
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,239
I'm not worrying.
I'm promoting you.

105
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:26,602
I need another attending
in General Surgery.

106
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,394
I'm submitting to the
board that it be you.

107
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,614
And that it starts this July.

108
00:05:32,716 --> 00:05:35,200
The minute you've
completed your residency.

109
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:38,620
I know there was
some talk a while back

110
00:05:38,722 --> 00:05:42,641
about you getting tired of
appies and gall bladders...

111
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:46,645
A full roster of appies and
gall bladders sounds perfect.

112
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:48,624
All right. But not
today, though.

113
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:50,826
Dixon's requested
you on her service.

114
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,711
This is subject to
board approval, Bailey,

115
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:54,486
though I'm not worried.

116
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:57,288
You have less to say now, huh?

117
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:00,822
Get out of here.

118
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,832
Dr. Dixon is not
big on eye contact,

119
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:09,467
so don't be surprised if
she doesn't look at you.

120
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,514
Also, try to avoid
physical contact,

121
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,354
loud or disruptive noises.

122
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,040
- She's OK? She's a good doctor?
- She's amazing.

123
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,770
You couldn't ask
for a better surgeon.

124
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,173
I'm telling you so
you'll be prepared.

125
00:06:20,197 --> 00:06:23,431
Dr. Dixon, Dr. Bailey, this
is Dan and Lisa Pollock.

126
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:26,668
I need to see the patient.
Where's the patient?

127
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,639
Hi.

128
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:32,473
Stacy Pollock, age nine.

129
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:35,677
She's suffering from pulmonary
hypertension due to a VSD.

130
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:40,181
Her EKG also shows a left
ventricular hypertrophy, also...

131
00:06:41,418 --> 00:06:44,252
- Hi. Can I help you folks?
- Not him.

132
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:47,943
- What's the trouble?
- Not him either.

133
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,551
Thank you. We'll wait.

134
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,311
What about him? Hello.
Could you help us, please?

135
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,598
- We need to talk to a grownup.
- This is the chief of surgery.

136
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,000
Just hold on. That doesn't
mean I'm not a doctor.

137
00:06:59,102 --> 00:07:00,285
How can we help?

138
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,721
- My husband...
- Our children went to college.

139
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,702
One's at Stanford,
the other at U-Dub.

140
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:08,810
We tried something...
a new thing.

141
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:12,680
- Something slipped
and we lost...
- Rachel.

142
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:16,167
We were reading this
thing in a magazine...

143
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,169
Here.

144
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:25,626
"Twenty Techniques to
Re-Ignite Your Nights."

145
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:28,229
We did Number Nine.

146
00:07:32,135 --> 00:07:36,872
- Let's get you in a gown...
- No. He did Number Nine.

147
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:38,184
We did Number Nine.

148
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,424
I'm not the one
with it stuck in my...

149
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,687
It's him. He's the patient.

150
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:48,399
Um... Have a seat.
We'll... take care of you.

151
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:52,687
Uh... I'll stand.

152
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,111
- Taking him now? For surgery?
- It's a good thing.

153
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,574
We'll get his dislocation fixed

154
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:03,965
so we prevent
problems with circulation.

155
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,167
Her last BP was
still up: 162 over 102.

156
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,820
The OB was worried
about placental blood flow.

157
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:11,322
Stay with her. Try
to keep her calm.

158
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,192
- OK.
- Cheeseburgers and...

159
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:17,595
- Painkillers are working.
- Anything else I can get you?

160
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,432
I'm OK. Are you
really taking him now?

161
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:21,766
Yeah.

162
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:27,855
Hmm, Cheeseburgers...
Cheeseburgers.

163
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:31,259
She's more relaxed
when she eats.

164
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:34,862
- Cheeseburgers calm her down.
- Thanks for the tip.

165
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,351
Stacy has a VSD, which
has gotten worse over time

166
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,687
and created
pulmonary hypertension.

167
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,123
- Does she need surgery?
- Are you OK?

168
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:49,561
That child looks like she's
gonna die, I am walking out.

169
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,063
I'll perform a transcatheter
closure to repair

170
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,581
the defect in the septum.

171
00:08:53,684 --> 00:08:57,535
That baby doesn't
understand a word she's saying.

172
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:01,573
Uh, she says we're gonna
fix the part of your heart

173
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,074
that pumps the
blood to your lungs.

174
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,927
A simple patch repair.

175
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:07,390
Probably something easy to fix.

176
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,893
A midline sternotomy incision

177
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:14,518
- may be required.
- Now she's making stuff up.

178
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:18,023
- I like your socks.
- Thanks. They're for soccer.

179
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:21,326
I'm the best on my team.
Mom says that's bragging.

180
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:24,228
Dad says it's not,
it's just the truth.

181
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,450
You can't fight who you are.

182
00:09:25,515 --> 00:09:28,133
If you're the best,
you're the best.

183
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,567
When you fix my heart,

184
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,570
how soon will I be able
to play soccer again?

185
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:37,825
- I missed half
the season already.
- Well, um...

186
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:41,329
we'll have to see.

187
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,869
Cristina. Did you tell
her about the ring?

188
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:49,181
Don't want to talk
about your ring.

189
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:50,483
Good. Don't.

190
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,608
You're not doing a big,
McDreamy thing? She'd hate that.

191
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,221
She built a house of candles.

192
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:57,194
She built you a
house of candles.

193
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:00,281
- You like that sort of thing.
- OK, thanks.

194
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:05,953
How is it? The journal? Is
it gross? Are they naked?

195
00:10:06,055 --> 00:10:09,490
No, not yet. It's kind of, um...

196
00:10:09,593 --> 00:10:12,343
hot, actually. But,
like, chastely hot.

197
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,929
It's all stolen glances
and loaded exchanges.

198
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,649
The thing reads like a
Victorian romance novel.

199
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:18,766
Chaste is good.

200
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,319
I'll let you know
when they do it.

201
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,466
She said a thing about babies.

202
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:10,668
Like babies were a
totally ordinary idea.

203
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,654
- Not afraid. She's ready.
- When are you gonna do it?

204
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,276
- What?
- Shepherd's proposing.

205
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:19,944
- No kidding! Outstanding!
- Thank you.

206
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:22,963
- How are you gonna do it?
- I don't know. I just decided.

207
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:24,832
- Morning.
- Shepherd's proposing.

208
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:28,503
- Congratulations. Big step.
- Thanks. Telling everybody?

209
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,905
You need advice. Hunt,
you ever proposed?

210
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:33,274
Uh, I'm not the guy to ask.
When are you gonna do it?

211
00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:34,696
More importantly, how?

212
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,862
What do you use, a twist-drill?

213
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,432
Not if you don't want a
partial-parietal hematoma.

214
00:11:43,887 --> 00:11:46,321
- Hi.
- Good luck.

215
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:50,090
Don't tell anybody else,
OK? I thought I could trust you.

216
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:53,661
Of course you can trust me.

217
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,765
We got the short
end of the stick.

218
00:11:57,867 --> 00:11:59,712
Quit laughing! We're
gonna get reamed.

219
00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:01,002
Dudes...

220
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:04,038
The patient can see you
giggling over here like schoolgirls.

221
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:07,092
- Enough wise cracks.
- Cracks!

222
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,922
- What's funny?
- Sorry, sir.

223
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:11,124
These idiots were
screwing around,

224
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:14,082
and I kind of
got... sucked into it.

225
00:12:14,184 --> 00:12:15,650
Enough.

226
00:12:15,752 --> 00:12:18,820
If you children need a
lesson in professionalism,

227
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:21,039
then come and see how it's done.

228
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:27,495
Mr. Kramer, your biplane
abdominal radiographs

229
00:12:27,597 --> 00:12:30,931
show a foreign body. We'll
perform a sigmoidoscopy

230
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:34,752
and proceed with
manual extraction.

231
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,872
- You'll get it out?
- We'll get it out.

232
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:41,258
- Hold it.
- That's the third time!

233
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,228
- What's the problem?
- She can't find a vein.

234
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,064
And she's pokin' me
like I'm her needlepoint.

235
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,577
What is wrong with you people?

236
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,670
Didn't you practice this
on each other? Look...

237
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:56,424
All right. When you have a
good vein, it should feel bouncy,

238
00:12:56,526 --> 00:13:00,344
like this one, OK? You go in
at an angle, not at 90 degrees.

239
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,647
Yeah. Yeah, like that.

240
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,850
Good.

241
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,319
Next time she'll do it on you.

242
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,192
You know, why don't
you run them both.

243
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:17,845
Listen up, you guys.

244
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:22,049
Before you run any more
procedures, come see me first.

245
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:27,037
So, clean bill of
health from Hunt?

246
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,251
Gonna get back on the horse?

247
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,469
I wouldn't use the word "horse."

248
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:31,859
That's not gonna work out.

249
00:13:31,962 --> 00:13:35,246
Things changed. I'm
gonna break up with her.

250
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:38,082
You're what? What
is wrong with you?

251
00:13:39,803 --> 00:13:41,936
I had to make sure the
patient's wife is stable.

252
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:43,621
She's hypertensive.

253
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:46,240
I think this surgery's more
stressful on her than him.

254
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:49,477
Damn it. There's a huge tear.

255
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,447
Clavicle jutting into
the artery. Hold this.

256
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:54,982
I'll hold pressure.
Page Hunt. Get him in!

257
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,285
No, they can't.
Patient's unstable.

258
00:13:57,387 --> 00:14:00,588
<i>Subclavian's bleeding
out. It doesn't look good.</i>

259
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,857
OK, thanks.

260
00:14:04,794 --> 00:14:08,046
What'd they say? Did
they say it's going well?

261
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:12,299
It's taking... a little
longer than expected.

262
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:14,401
OK...

263
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:17,755
But don't worry,
because it's going great.

264
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:20,458
- It is? Are you sure?
- Yes.

265
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,794
You know, it's good
when they take their time.

266
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,913
Right now, there is
no reason to believe

267
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:28,082
that he's not gonna be...

268
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:30,551
- just fine.
- OK.

269
00:14:30,654 --> 00:14:34,322
Oh, thank you.

270
00:14:34,424 --> 00:14:37,075
Hey, your pressure's way down.

271
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:40,862
Jen?

272
00:14:41,898 --> 00:14:43,147
Jen!

273
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:07,472
- What's happening?
- Tamponading.

274
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,673
Her BP crashed, she
has muffled heart sounds.

275
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:14,312
Damn it. Gloves. Yang,
Betadine and give her local.

276
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:18,216
Stacy, sweetie, you're
gonna be all right, OK?

277
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,785
Don't worry. 18-gauge.

278
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:24,071
- What are you doing?
- Lisa, turn around or leave.

279
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,467
You're not gonna
wanna watch this.

280
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:29,027
Keep the ultrasound
over the effusion.

281
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,512
Stacy, honey, you're
gonna feel a little pinch

282
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:34,532
and then a lot of pressure.

283
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:39,086
And then you're gonna be
all better, OK? Here we go.

284
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:46,193
Good. Oh, good job, Stacy.

285
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:51,683
There. See? It's
all better. Good job.

286
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:56,454
Good job, honey. All better.

287
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,897
Her pulmonary pressures are
high. She's got cor pulmonale.

288
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,300
I'm moving up her surgery.
Yang's getting an OR now.

289
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:11,235
See you in there.

290
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:13,849
Let me know how it goes.
Great save, Dr. Bailey.

291
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:15,923
I think you better stay.

292
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,309
I'm not scrubbing
in on this one.

293
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,894
Bailey.

294
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:23,030
- You can handle this surgery.
- I can.

295
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:27,385
What I can't handle is feeling
another child slipping away,

296
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,538
- right in front of me.
- Mostly, they don't slip away.

297
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,741
Even the really sick ones.
Jackson was a special case.

298
00:16:33,843 --> 00:16:36,243
- Even he survived.
- By the skin of his teeth.

299
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:39,046
But he survived.
Children are resilient.

300
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:40,882
In all likelihood,

301
00:16:40,984 --> 00:16:44,134
you'll open this girl's chest
and fix something simple.

302
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:47,421
Then you'll hand her
back the rest of her life.

303
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:51,175
I'm telling you, Bailey, you
want to be there for that.

304
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,817
Come on, come on,
come on, stabilize.

305
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:04,255
BP's going up. Going up.

306
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,727
- Thank you.
- He should be good to go.

307
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:14,298
- Dr. Grey? Jen Harmon...
- Tell Jen he's stable.

308
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:15,850
She's not. She had a seizure.

309
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,335
- A seizure?
- We got him, Grey. Go help her.

310
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,687
OK.

311
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,561
- You're an idiot.
- Excuse me?

312
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:30,097
You're an idiot.
What is your problem?

313
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:34,468
He is proposing to her.

314
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,788
That makes Little
Her his little sister.

315
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,725
And I can't sleep with any more
of his sisters. And she's young.

316
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,994
- And I'm her boss.
- And I'm celibate.

317
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,574
What's that have
to do with anything?

318
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:48,248
Celibacy's lonely.
Don't spend time

319
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:50,951
wondering what you
are or who you like

320
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:52,464
or whether it's right
for you or wrong for you.

321
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,655
Let yourself be happy.

322
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:59,643
Before you find yourself
alone... and celibate.

323
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,766
Does she really need a
chest x-ray? She's got the flu.

324
00:18:05,868 --> 00:18:08,335
Say that after you've
ruled out pneumonia.

325
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:11,071
Be quick and efficient,
keep a smile on your face

326
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:14,575
and make stupid, happy small
talk to keep them distracted

327
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:18,779
- and not panicky.
- OK. Should I do
small talk now?

328
00:18:18,881 --> 00:18:20,798
No.

329
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,601
Just tell me to lie still
and take a deep breath.

330
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:27,655
OK. Big breath in,
and then don't move.

331
00:18:31,627 --> 00:18:34,862
So... how are you gonna do it?

332
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:39,750
You gonna... go big?
Grand, romantic gesture?

333
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,285
I... I don't know yet.

334
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:44,088
I'm not sure Meredith's
a grand gesture girl.

335
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,956
You want to do
the grand gesture.

336
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,976
It's the opening pitch. It
determines the entire game.

337
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:50,444
You've gotta go all out.

338
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,847
Your plans should
include flowers,

339
00:18:52,949 --> 00:18:56,801
candles, exotic foods, live
musicians and a rowboat.

340
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,602
Skywriting is not
out of the question.

341
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,971
- Dr. Shepherd.
- Yes.

342
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,257
You gotta...

343
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:07,427
- Hi.
- What's up?

344
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:10,364
- I need a neuro consult.
- OK.

345
00:19:10,466 --> 00:19:14,251
- That's big. You better go.
- Thanks, chief. OK.

346
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:16,837
OK.

347
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:22,092
- How we doing, Mr. Kramer?
- Oh, fantastic.

348
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:26,163
They didn't cover this in
the<i> What To Expect</i> books.

349
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,466
They didn't say
"Expect seizures."

350
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:29,808
That's why we're doing an exam.

351
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:32,537
- Look down for me.
- OK.

352
00:19:32,622 --> 00:19:35,322
- Oh, what's that?
- Oh, uh, Dr. Grey.

353
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,758
Could you set up an MRI
for Mrs. Harmon, please?

354
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,844
- Did you see...?
- Now.

355
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,130
OK.

356
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:49,069
- Oh, you saw something.
- No, no.

357
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:51,422
No, I'm sorry. Can
you keep a secret?

358
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,040
You bet I can.

359
00:19:55,544 --> 00:19:58,278
This is intended for Dr. Grey.

360
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,065
- Supposed to be a surprise.
- Oh, my God, I almost blew it!

361
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,484
When are you gonna
do it? Please do it today.

362
00:20:03,586 --> 00:20:05,636
- Do it here.
- No. I don't know.

363
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:08,905
I was told it's supposed
to be a grand gesture.

364
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,153
Rob proposed to me
in a supermarket aisle.

365
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:14,394
He said that was the place
he saw me for the first time.

366
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:17,981
So I said yes between the
cat food and the tampons.

367
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,685
- Oh! That's romantic.
- It was, actually.

368
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,922
We still have to do the
MRI, OK? Just to be safe.

369
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:30,243
- OK. Dr. Shepherd?
- Yes.

370
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:34,414
- Should I be scared?
- No. Should I?

371
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,184
No.

372
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,807
Eisenmenger's complex.

373
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,976
- Can it be repaired?
- Children are resilient.

374
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,814
Nine times out of ten you'll
find something simple to fix.

375
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:52,650
What is it?

376
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,868
I can repair the VSD,
but this heart is finished.

377
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,022
This is one of the most
diseased hearts I've seen.

378
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:02,409
ECMO might hold her over, but
without a heart-lung transplant,

379
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,811
she's going to die.

380
00:21:03,913 --> 00:21:06,647
Dr. Bailey? Dr. Bailey?

381
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:08,098
Dr. Bailey?

382
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,102
It's OK. I can
take care of this.

383
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:31,188
Her heart is too far gone.

384
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,108
There's far too much
scar tissue to repair.

385
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,209
We've started her
on IV medications,

386
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:38,579
which she'll need on
a continuous basis.

387
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:40,080
For how long? How
long does she...?

388
00:21:40,182 --> 00:21:42,750
Until she can
receive a transplant.

389
00:21:42,852 --> 00:21:45,969
- Months?
- Years, possibly.

390
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:49,222
Years? She'll lay
in a bed for years?

391
00:21:49,324 --> 00:21:50,758
I'm afraid so, yes.

392
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,018

What do you see?

403
00:22:41,844 --> 00:22:45,613
Uh... I see a crazy person,

404
00:22:45,714 --> 00:22:47,831
taking expensive
tests for no reason.

405
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:51,117
And I see the chief finding out
and expelling the crazy person.

406
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:55,055
Then I see joblessness,
homelessness and depression.

407
00:22:55,157 --> 00:22:59,410
It does not look good,
Izzie. It doesn't look good.

Dr. O'Malley out of the booth.</i>

409
00:23:06,668 --> 00:23:08,847

- No, but I have to talk to you.

410
00:23:08,871 --> 00:23:10,337
Derek is going crazy.

411
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:12,857
I said something about
having cute babies,

412
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:15,476
and he's been acting
weird and avoiding me

413
00:23:15,578 --> 00:23:17,177
and dropping conversations.

414
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:19,546
He wants babies. He's
always wanted babies.

415
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,293
- Aw, he wants babies.
- Maybe not my babies.

416
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,350
No, that's not it.

417
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:25,569
My babies will have Alzheimer's.

418
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:28,755
And suicidal tendencies.
And split ends.

419
00:23:28,858 --> 00:23:31,642
- You might have something.
- I don't think you do.

420
00:23:32,928 --> 00:23:36,730
- Who are you?
- I'm Jen.

421
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,317
How are we doing? All set?

422
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:46,740
If you're gonna do it, do it
soon. She's really freaking out.

423
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:49,743
Thank you.

424
00:23:53,949 --> 00:23:57,885
They tried Nine? Who does Nine?

425
00:23:57,987 --> 00:24:00,921
Personally, I'm a fan of Five...

426
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,207
Seven, Eight...

427
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,194
Pretty much 12 through 20.

428
00:24:10,465 --> 00:24:12,995
- I would try 15.
- Don't try 15.

431
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,208
I would try 16. Yeah. I've
never done that before.

432
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:24,228
- You'd try 16?
- Hmm-hmm. I would.

433
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:27,814
I totally would.

434
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:33,570
Um, don't do 16 too fast!
You can get hurt. Badly.

435
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:37,491
- I've heard.
- You know who likes a good 12?

436
00:24:38,294 --> 00:24:40,393
Hmm-hmm.

437
00:24:42,297 --> 00:24:45,933

441
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,332
- It would be fatal.

443
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,921
No. There's another way.
There's a way she won't have to.

444
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:11,041
With a diagnosis of
pulmonary hyper...

445
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:13,104
The girl needs a backpack.

446
00:25:13,128 --> 00:25:15,796
A backpack that has a portable
pump that will deliver her meds

447
00:25:15,898 --> 00:25:18,682
and allow her to play

448
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:20,834
and go to school
and have a childhood.

449
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,698
Until she gets her new heart.

450
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:24,605
This is something
we should discuss

451
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,623
- privately...
- She can leave?

452
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:30,377
She can. She has to wear
the backpack at all times.

453
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:31,929
Put you in a program,

454
00:25:32,014 --> 00:25:33,725
teach you to
administer medications.

455
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:37,117
Do you have a prettier one?

456
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:41,305
- My God, Dr. Bailey. Thank you!
- Dr. Dixon, thank you so much!

457
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:43,490
- So much!
- Dr. Dixon!

458
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:46,927
- Thank you!
- No! No, no!

459
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:51,731
No!

460
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:10,550
Oh, uh... Dr. Dixon, what
can I do? How can I help?

461
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,720
You can observe protocol.
I was getting to that option...

462
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:17,457
It was too much. There was too
much yelling, too much touching.

463
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:19,042
Too much.

464
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:25,249
OK. I'll leave you alone.

465
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:29,169
No, no! I don't need
alone. I need pressure.

466
00:26:30,639 --> 00:26:33,374
- I...
- I need my nervous system
suppressed.

467
00:26:33,476 --> 00:26:36,442
I need tight constant, deep,

468
00:26:36,545 --> 00:26:40,781
tight pressure across
large areas of my body.

469
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:45,285
I need you to hold me!

470
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:49,923
- OK, um...
- Tight... tightly.

471
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,926
Tighter.

472
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,747
You're a very tiny person.

473
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,967
I need a bigger
person. I need more...

474
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:02,736
Should I...?

475
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:08,175
- Oh... What can I do?
- Get over here
and hug on Dr. Dixon.

476
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:10,722
I was thinking a
shot of Thorazine.

477
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:13,066
Get over here.

478
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:21,404
- Just...
- Yeah. Good.

479
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:30,647
An aneurysm? A brain aneurysm?

480
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,684
Your symptoms,
forgetfulness, dizziness,

481
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:36,119
chronic headaches, can be
associated with pregnancy.

482
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:38,266
The reason we discovered yours

483
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:41,308
- is because of the seizure.
- So, what? You can fix it?

484
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,209
You can take it out?

485
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,861
First thing in the morning

486
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:48,098
after Rob's recovered from
complications with surgery.

487
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,700
Complications? What?

488
00:27:49,785 --> 00:27:52,769
You said... You said it was
fine. You said he was OK.

489
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,137
You lied to me?

490
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,680
I'm sorry. I didn't
want to worry you

491
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:59,058
- until I knew. He's fine.
- You'll be fine, too.

492
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:03,046
- But it could burst, right?
- Jen, you have to stay calm.

493
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,532
You just told me there's
a time bomb in my head!

494
00:28:05,634 --> 00:28:07,834
I promise you that I'm
not gonna stay calm!

495
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:28,238
Cows are squeezed in a
chute before they're slaughtered.

496
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,857
The chute applies
intense pressure

497
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,210
resulting in
decreased pulse rate,

498
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:35,245
metabolic rate and muscle tone.

499
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:38,865

00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,160
This is good.
This... It's working.

506
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:53,780
- So we can stop now?
- No.

507
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,685
Almost there, Mr. Kramer.

508
00:28:58,787 --> 00:29:02,739
- Hold on... There.
- Oh, my God!

509
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:09,129
Oh, thank you! Never again
will I try to spice things up.

510
00:29:09,231 --> 00:29:11,998
- I'm not spicing anything up.
- You tried to step it up.

511
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,400
Anything above
Five deserves props.

512
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:18,354
Sounds to me like you're
doing good. You're together,

513
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:22,059
and you're both bending over
backwards to find new ways to...

514
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,427
make each other happy.

515
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:28,732
Take a step back, you realize
that you're doing just fine.

516
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:37,574
"Bending over backwards."

- You can let me go now.
- Sorry.

525
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:28,708
Dr. Stevens, I have
the blood test results.

526
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:32,762
- What is it?
- You're anemic.

527
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:34,163
Anemic?

528
00:30:35,884 --> 00:30:37,584
Oh, my God!

529
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:41,082
Do you realize what you did?

530
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:42,750
Your face said I
was going to die,

531
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,924
- not, "Go get a hamburger."
- Well, see I...

532
00:30:45,026 --> 00:30:47,827
That's part of patient
care, controlling your face.

533
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,730
- I just...
- Anemic.

534
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:55,252
This is fine. This is no
big deal. It's like nothing!

535
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:58,638
How's Mrs. What's-her-name?

536
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:05,412
That's not good, is it?

537
00:31:05,514 --> 00:31:06,980
Yeah. No.

538
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:10,400
Her LDH is off the charts.

539
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:13,353
What is it? Is it cancer?

540
00:31:14,722 --> 00:31:17,162
Consult Oncology.
Start a work-up.

541
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:24,531
Um...

542
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:27,000
It's OK. We'll
tell her together.

543
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:29,152
Thank you.

544
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,327
Hi.

545
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:44,918
- I don't want to keep secrets.
- Sorry?

546
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,370
I've been keeping
secrets all day.

547
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:50,306
About surgeries
and rings and you.

548
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,508
And that secret, the you secret,

549
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:54,561
it's giving me high
blood pressure.

550
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:57,731
I don't want that secret.

551
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,650
We're having... a relationship.

552
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,854
And if we are, if
we're in a relationship,

553
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:07,323
then I need to be in it,

554
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,258
in front of my sister.

555
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,195
And Derek Shepherd.
If we can't do that,

556
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:14,648
then I can't do this.

557
00:33:34,662 --> 00:33:37,041
What's going on? What happened?

558
00:33:37,065 --> 00:33:37,964
Sorry. I can't.

559
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:38,965
You're shaking.

560
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:40,817
Leave me alone. I saw someone.

561
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,153
Someone I knew. I
can't do this. I can't.

562
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:45,655
- OK.
- Please, go away.

563
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:48,424
OK. It's all right.

564
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,911
- It's OK.
- No, I don't want this.

565
00:33:51,013 --> 00:33:53,346
- I don't want this!
- I'm applying pressure.

566
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,015
- I can't do this!
- To relax your nervous system.

567
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,550
Decrease your metabolic rate.

568
00:33:57,653 --> 00:33:59,669
You'll feel more
panicked at first.

569
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,405
You'll try to resist it,

570
00:34:01,507 --> 00:34:04,958
but eventually you'll
feel your pulse rate slow.

571
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:06,826
Your pulse rate
will slow. It's OK.

572
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:08,339
Your breath will come easier.

573
00:34:08,363 --> 00:34:11,331
Your breath will
come easier. OK.

574
00:34:11,433 --> 00:34:14,534
Breathe.

575
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,469
OK.

576
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:21,808
I'm sorry for my outburst.

577
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:24,377
I should have
spoken to you first.

578
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,519
It was inappropriate,
but I've come to expect it

579
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:28,598
from pediatric surgeons.

580
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,401
- Always breaking protocol.
- I'm not a pediatric surgeon.

581
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:36,222
I've landed a few peds
surg cases recently,

582
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:40,043
but I'm getting back to general
surgery the first chance I get.

583
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:42,678
You touch the child
whenever you speak with her.

584
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,282
You explain conditions to
the child, not just the parents.

585
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:49,085
You react to the patient
as if it was your own child.

586
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:51,621
You break protocol,
which is inappropriate.

587
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:53,439
Except in pediatric surgery,

588
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:56,192
where protocols are
constantly evolving.

589
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:57,928
You are not a general surgeon.

590
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,864
You're a pediatric surgeon.

591
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:11,107
Hey! Did you eat? Let me
change, I'll come with you.

592
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:14,377
No, no, no. I can't.
I have to... work.

593
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,606
OK, listen.

594
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,558
You have been acting
like a basket case

595
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:20,366
since I dropped that stupid
comment about babies.

596
00:35:20,468 --> 00:35:22,335
If you don't want babies

597
00:35:22,437 --> 00:35:23,798
or if you don't
want babies with me

598
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:25,984
and my crappy DNA, just say so.

599
00:35:26,008 --> 00:35:27,248
You don't have to avoid me

600
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:29,626
or make up lame
excuses about work.

601
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:32,779
Meredith, I want
your crappy babies.

602
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:35,732
- You do?
- All of them.

603
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:40,119
- OK. Do you wanna eat?
- No. I have... I gotta...

604
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,587
I have to work.

605
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,253
Oh, my God.

606
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:01,441
- Did you use a BeDazzler?
- Circa 1986.

607
00:36:01,543 --> 00:36:04,293
As seen on TV.

608
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,997
Dixon's right, you know.

609
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,333
You do belong in Peds surgery.

610
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:15,538
My own baby
almost died last year.

611
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,773
The doctors in this
hospital, my friends,

612
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:20,827
they all worked
to save his life.

613
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:25,581
And I stood outside the
room feeling so useless,

614
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,718
so pointless and helpless.

615
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,138
Like I was losing
everything in the world.

616
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,073
And when he didn't die,

617
00:36:34,175 --> 00:36:35,569
I knew I didn't want
to be anywhere near

618
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:38,445
that feeling again, so...

619
00:36:38,547 --> 00:36:41,431
I think that makes
me pretty unsuitable

620
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,616
for pediatric surgery.

621
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,320
I'd say...

622
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:50,623

650
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:35,244
I'm Arizona Robbins.
Peds surgery.

651
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:37,813
I've seen you at the hospital.

652
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,227
Are you OK?

653
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:41,484
You know, I'm fine. Fine.

654
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:45,121
People talk. Where
we work. They talk.

655
00:38:45,223 --> 00:38:47,724
A lot. So for the
sake of being honest,

656
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:51,978
I think I should tell you
that I know things about you.

657
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,030
Because people talk.

658
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:58,368
Oh... You mean...

659
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:04,524
- Terrific.
- It is, actually. The talk.

660
00:39:04,626 --> 00:39:07,042
People really like
you over there.

661
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:10,613
They respect you and they're
concerned and interested.

662
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:11,748
They really like you.

663
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:15,852
Some of them really like you.

664
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:19,405
You just look upset.

665
00:39:19,507 --> 00:39:23,743
And I thought that you should
know that the talk is good.

666
00:39:23,845 --> 00:39:29,064
And when you're not upset,
when you're over being upset,

00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:11,524
What, the flowers?
Girls love this crap.

679
00:40:11,626 --> 00:40:13,743
It's a cliché. I'm a cliché.

680
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:16,896
Clichés became
clichés for a reason.

681
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:20,433
Because they worked.

682
00:40:20,535 --> 00:40:23,119
It's great, isn't it?

683
00:40:23,205 --> 00:40:25,688
When you feel so
strongly for someone,

684
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,390
and it's not just about the sex.

685
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:30,126
It is...

686
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:33,229
It's true.

687
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,050
You should not talk like that.

688
00:40:38,152 --> 00:40:40,353
Yeah. You're right.

689
00:40:40,455 --> 00:40:43,022
You're all set here. I'm
gonna leave you to it.

690
00:40:43,124 --> 00:40:44,290
Thanks.

691
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:50,079
Congratulations.

692
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,398
Thanks.
