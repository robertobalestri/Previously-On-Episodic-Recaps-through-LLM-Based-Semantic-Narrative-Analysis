8
00:00:30,847 --> 00:00:33,315
No. I'm a doctor here.

Cristina? Owen!

29
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:21,156
What...? What?

30
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:36,221
It's three in the morning,
Cristina. This better be...

31
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,624
Callie?

32
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,930
What? He what?

33
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:49,133
It's me. Cristina!

34
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:57,425
What's going on?
Owen's out there upset,

35
00:02:57,527 --> 00:03:00,328
- Callie was screaming...
- No changes in visual acuity.

36
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,715
No petechiae. I'm fine.

37
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,418
Oh, my God! Your
neck! I will kill him!

38
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,165
No, no, no. He had a nightmare.

39
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,590
Cristina, please.

40
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,692
Is she all right? I just need
to know that she's all right.

41
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:17,729
No, no, no. Cristina, no.

42
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,285
I am so sorry.

43
00:03:26,657 --> 00:03:31,175
I don't know what happened.
I don't know what happened.

44
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,845
- I'm sorry.
- Look at me.

45
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,481
- I'm sorry.
- Look at me.

46
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:42,354
I'm fine. See? It's
OK. You were asleep.

47
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:45,440
It's OK. OK? It's OK. It's OK.

48
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:49,678
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK. I know.

49
00:03:51,782 --> 00:03:56,118
It's OK. You were asleep.
It's OK. OK? It's OK.

50
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,972
It's OK. It's OK.
It's OK. It's OK.

51
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,587
There's coffee.

52
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,884
No. Not like this.

53
00:04:33,957 --> 00:04:35,873
Today's your first day
back at the hospital.

54
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,242
Today's about Izzie.

55
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:41,612
You have to operate on
her brain. You have a gift.

56
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,851
And you can do this.

57
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,727
I'm gonna shower before I go in.

58
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,252
You're wearing a
turtleneck under your scrubs.

59
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:05,987
It's ugly.

60
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,924
Not as ugly as the fact
that you hugged him.

61
00:05:09,026 --> 00:05:12,009
- You hugged him...
- I get it. I hear you. Move on.

62
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:15,162
Turtlenecks aren't OK. You're
not OK. Your boyfriend is not OK.

63
00:05:15,265 --> 00:05:17,632
- Is your boyfriend OK?
- What?

64
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,618
To be cutting into brains
today. Is he OK to be back?

65
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,815
Yes. Of course. Derek is fine.

66
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,973
I was there for his carnage
in the OR, remember?

67
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:29,194
This isn't just any
patient. This is Izzie.

68
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:41,790
George, hey. I'm
surprised you're not...

69
00:05:41,892 --> 00:05:44,459
Isn't there a presentation
happening with Izzie?

70
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:48,347
I didn't know she was sick.
Bailey told me after Cristina told her.

71
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:51,032
Izzie trusted Cristina. I
was the very last to know.

72
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:54,068
- I'm sure Izzie
wasn't trying...
- I don't want to talk about it.

73
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,671
I want to work. Do you have
any room on your service?

74
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,909
- Yeah. Three
hip replacements...
- Thank you.

75
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,134
You three. I understand why
you're here. You want to help.

76
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,103
I will be the
resident on her case.

77
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,172
I will be prepping
her for surgery.

78
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:18,109
If you're going into that hospital
room, you will do so as her friends.

79
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,627
Izzie needs her
people around her

80
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:21,746
to tell her everything
will be fine.

81
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:25,400
She needs you to hold her hand. She
needs you, not more doctors. Understood?

82
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,091
Great. Let's get started.

83
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:36,777
As you know, you have
stage-four metastatic melanoma.

84
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,125
We have surgeries and procedures

85
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,176
lined up for you over
the next few weeks.

86
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,335
We've seen mets on your
liver, so one of those surgeries,

87
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:48,740
Dr. Bailey and I will resect them.
We also lined up Dr. Parker from OB

88
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:51,103
to harvest as many
healthy eggs as she can

89
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:53,088
before you undergo
any radiation.

90
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,463
- Right. Babies.
- Leaving the option open,

91
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:57,582
- if you want it.
- But our priority

92
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,378
is to address
mets in your brain.

93
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:00,813
I'm surprised
we didn't catch it.

94
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,504
It causes headaches,
seizures, hallucinations.

95
00:07:03,606 --> 00:07:06,525
Hopefully the lesion has clear
margins and I can remove it.

96
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,210
Are you people done?

97
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,196
Over the next four weeks,

98
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,543
you're slated for
three major surgeries,

99
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:16,584
seven outpatient procedures,
just for mets we've found.

100
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,364
In all likelihood,
we will find more.

101
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:20,533
We may have to
cut into you more.

102
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:22,601
You may as well get
used to the idea now.

103
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:26,494
I'll be administering your radiation,
chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

104
00:07:26,596 --> 00:07:30,631
The treatment will be aggressive,
it will be harsh. Prepare yourself.

105
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:33,117
I'll be overseeing
procedures, including today's,

106
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:39,307
which means every surgeon
in this room now answers to me.

107
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:43,044
Welcome to the
cancer wing, folks.

108
00:07:45,782 --> 00:07:47,449
See you in the OR.

109
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,239
Thanks.

110
00:07:57,261 --> 00:07:59,627
Seriously, don't just
stand there staring at me.

111
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,979
It's making me nervous.

112
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,315
- Get out of here. Go save lives.
- Yeah, we have rounds.

113
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,351
- Yeah.
- OK. See you later.

114
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,622
Karev, I just reviewed
Izzie's most recent MRI.

115
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:30,842
Doesn't look like the tumor
has grown since her last scans.

116
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:35,730
Do you have concerns you'd like to
discuss with me before we brief Izzie?

117
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:38,766
Just try keeping her frontal
lobe inside her skull this time.

118
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:45,623
Good morning, Izzie.

119
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:49,844
- You coming?
- No. I'm on
this old lady, so...

120
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:52,931
- This'll only take a minute.
- I gotta go, really.

121
00:08:55,085 --> 00:08:57,969
Hi, Dr. Sloan. These are
Aunt Joyce's nephews,

122
00:08:58,071 --> 00:08:59,782
my brothers Tobin and Luke.

123
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,474
They flew in early this morning.
Dr. Sloan did the surgery.

124
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,793
I'm sorry. Your
aunt is very sick.

125
00:09:04,895 --> 00:09:06,328
There's not much more we can do.

126
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,013
Probably time to
say your goodbyes.

127
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,949
Do you mean say our goodbyes now

128
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,501
or sometime in
the next 24 hours?

129
00:09:13,603 --> 00:09:16,204
I mean, what kind of time
frame are we talking about?

130
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:21,025
- Twenty-four hours
seems unlikely.
- You sure?

131
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:23,445
Because I have a flight
to catch in the morning,

132
00:09:23,547 --> 00:09:28,399
and if I wait past
noon, I can't change it.

133
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,987
I need to be on a plane
tonight. Board meeting tomorrow.

134
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:36,725
So do you think she'll
die before tomorrow?

135
00:09:40,563 --> 00:09:43,598
You really think Shepherd's the
guy for Steven's surgery today?

136
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,312
- Someone else in mind?
- Shepherd wouldn't
be my choice,

137
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,937
given his recent history, but it's
not my brain he'll be manhandling.

138
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,708
- No.
- Damn. She's HLA type B3.

139
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,328
Have to hit her with the DTIC
and high dose IL-2 instead.

140
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:00,415
- IL-2? That's pretty toxic.
- It's about as bad as it gets.

141
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:04,185
- You're gonna
tell Izzie this now?
- I am her oncologist.

142
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:06,871
Studies show giving patients
bad news before surgery

143
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,741
can drastically increase
their chances of complications.

144
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,277
Today or tomorrow,
the news is the same.

145
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:13,711
Right now, I have time.

146
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,780
You coming?

147
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:18,733
I believe Izzie is
down in radiology now.

148
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:20,819
Fine. We can wait an hour.

149
00:10:26,976 --> 00:10:31,012
- Chief, you paged me?
- Karev. Yes, I did.

150
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:32,680
Um...

151
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:35,783
As you know, we're
gonna be harvesting eggs.

152
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:37,886
From Stevens.

153
00:10:37,988 --> 00:10:41,238
Who, I believe, is someone
you're having relations with.

154
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,741
- Chief.
- Frozen eggs have a better

155
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:47,812
survival rate when
they're... fertilized.

156
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:52,150
- Fertilized.
- I know this
is a lot to digest.

157
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:57,271
So take some
time, think about it.

158
00:10:57,373 --> 00:11:00,025
If you decide this is
something you might consider...

159
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:03,544
- Give me the cup.
- Karev. Speak to Stevens.

160
00:11:03,646 --> 00:11:05,462
Just give me the cup!

161
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:23,898
- Is she doing OK?
- Yeah. Well, she says she is.

162
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,817
- Do you believe her?
- No. Not really.

163
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,620
Oh. Heads up.

164
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:59,450
- What do you hear?
- Motorcycle lost control. No helmet,

165
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,787
massive head trauma,
lost vital signs en route.

166
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,757
- Good to have
you back, Shepherd.
- Thanks.

167
00:12:35,205 --> 00:12:36,771
Get back inside. He's DOA.

168
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,443
Hunt? Did you hear me?

169
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:45,779
Owen.

170
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,602
Swender has no vision.

171
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,281
He wrapped his hands
around your throat,

172
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:11,216
you're pretending
nothing happened.

173
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,523
Focus on Izzie.

174
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,294
Hunt literally tried to kill you.
He's barely back from Iraq.

175
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:19,676
It's obvious he has issues. That
doesn't mean you have to stand by...

176
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:23,201
If he had a heart attack
or a stroke or lost a leg,

177
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,735
would you walk away?

178
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:27,772
How is it acceptable I walk
away from this? He's wounded.

179
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,523
He has war wounds, Meredith.

180
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:33,294
It's not cut and dried. And
it's not as bad as you think it is.

181
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,830
Clear.

182
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,567
- This might be it.
- From your lips to God's ears.

183
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:42,520
Charge to 360. Clear.

184
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:48,293
- Oh, for the love of God.
- Hey.

185
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:50,828
You know how many people
are in this hospital waiting,

186
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,249
hoping loved ones might
live? You're a bunch of vultures.

187
00:13:54,351 --> 00:13:57,969
- But we're not.
- Aunt Joyce was
given a month to live

188
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:01,205
three years ago.
And we were crushed.

189
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,976
And we held her hand
at her bedside for weeks,

190
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,962
and we said our tearful
goodbyes. And then...

191
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,048
she stabilized.

192
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,851
She's been in and out of
the hospital once a month.

193
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:17,938
Each time we jump on a plane, sit by
her bed, say our goodbyes all over again.

194
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,091
And each time, she
winds up getting better.

195
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,861
We want to be here when
she goes. We really do.

196
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:27,632
But... it's a lot of flying
around the country.

197
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:32,803
She's ready. We're
all ready. It's time.

198
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,972
And I've got a board
meeting tomorrow.

199
00:14:37,593 --> 00:14:39,076
Big one.

200
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,583
They're doing tests that show altered
brain anatomy in patients with PTSD.

201
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:49,587
Close to understanding the
physical side of psychological trauma.

202
00:14:49,673 --> 00:14:54,475
- Amazing what you can
see with an MRI.
- What did Meredith tell you?

203
00:14:54,577 --> 00:14:57,845
Post-traumatic stress
is a real injury, Owen.

204
00:14:57,947 --> 00:15:03,117
It can be healed. There are
resources, vet centers, therapy.

205
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:05,647
You shouldn't try and
handle this on your own.

206
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,805
I came back in one
piece, both arms, both legs.

207
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,007
Lots of guys came
back with real injuries.

208
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:13,210
The worst I have is nightmares
or freezing for a moment...

209
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,713
Is that what
happened last night?

210
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:20,768
You had a freezing moment?
If you want, I can help.

211
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:24,205
Oh, yeah? I'm not the
one who needs help.

212
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:27,425
I'm not the one who cut out
half a brain and ran off to hide.

213
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:30,261
I'm not the one half the
hospital is talking about.

214
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:35,333
You should spend less time worrying
about me and take a look in the mirror.

215
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:46,210
Karev? Just checking in.
To see how you're com...

216
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:48,813
- See how you're doing.
- I'd be doing better

217
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:51,315
if you weren't on the other
side of the door listening.

218
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,111
Uh... Right, right. Sorry.

219
00:15:53,135 --> 00:15:56,321
I said go away.

220
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,626
You left the door
unlocked. That's bold.

221
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:05,479
- The chief send you in here?
- No. I offered to come in

222
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:09,283
- in case you need to talk.
- You think talking will help?

223
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,901
A Dixie cup full of my swimmers

224
00:16:10,986 --> 00:16:13,855
will make everything
OK? It's crap.

225
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:15,857
This is crap!

226
00:16:17,627 --> 00:16:21,428
You can't go messing with
people's heads like that.

227
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,163
Even if she freezes the embryos,

228
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:25,299
you think we'll get a
chance to use them?

229
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,335
You think she'll still be here?

230
00:16:28,437 --> 00:16:31,856
You think she'll survive
all this? You think...

231
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,628
I think... She told me...

232
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:40,414
She told me she was
seeing a ghost, OK?

233
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:44,769
And I'm so used to all the crazy
chicks in my life that I didn't even...

234
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:52,176
I'm a doctor. A doctor!

235
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,213
And I didn't even think to...

236
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:01,285
And now she's... This is...

237
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:06,607
This is wrong. This isn't
how it's supposed to happen.

238
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:09,259
- I know.
- It's crap!

239
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,678
- I know.
- I hate this.

240
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,913
I know.

241
00:17:14,984 --> 00:17:16,183
This isn't...

242
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,620
<i>♪ I'm not ready ♪</i>

243
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:24,025
This isn't how we were... This
isn't how I wanted to do this.

244
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:27,795
This isn't how Izzie and I
were supposed to make a baby.

245
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:38,556
<i>♪ For the weight of us ♪</i>

246
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:43,877
<i>♪ For the weight of us ♪</i>

247
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:48,716
- <i>♪ For the weight of us ♪</i>
- I haven't seen you all day.

248
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,518
What if I hadn't woken up?

249
00:17:54,423 --> 00:17:59,360
I can't even remember what
happened. I have no memory, no way to...

250
00:18:02,398 --> 00:18:05,933
I would never hurt you, ever.

251
00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:09,803
But I did. My hands just...

252
00:18:09,905 --> 00:18:13,090
How could my own
two hands be capable...?

253
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:17,978
- I can't do this, Cristina.
- But you did wake up.

254
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,743
- Stop blaming yourself.
- We have to stop
seeing each other.

255
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:21,698
Why?

256
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:23,718
- Cristina, I almost...
- Almost what?

257
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,789
I told you, I know my limits.

258
00:18:28,892 --> 00:18:31,592
Let me decide what I can handle.

259
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:41,385
<i>♪ For the weight of us ♪</i>

260
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:46,540
<i>♪ For the weight of us ♪</i>

261
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,996
<i>♪ Oooh... ♪</i>

262
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,683
Good. Stand right
there. Let me see.

263
00:18:56,786 --> 00:18:58,753
I never know how
long to make these.

264
00:18:58,855 --> 00:19:01,295
I like the color.
Who's it for, Karev?

265
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,987
Haven't seen much of him today.

266
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:06,493
He's working.
They're all working.

267
00:19:06,595 --> 00:19:09,329
I told them to go work.
Their patients shouldn't suffer

268
00:19:09,432 --> 00:19:11,965
because I have things
growing on my organs.

269
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,220
I have got a colectomy
this afternoon.

270
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:19,773
If you were the
resident assisting me,

271
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:24,378
and I were to say to you, "Divide
the cecum," what would you use?

272
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,280
I'm not assisting you.

273
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:28,215
You're not gonna ask
me to divide the cecum.

274
00:19:28,318 --> 00:19:32,152
But you're not going to get rusty.
In a year, you need to do this stuff.

275
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,866
You need to teach residents.

276
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:38,642
- Think I'm gonna
be here in a year?
- Yes, I do.

277
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:43,146
So I have exposed
the right lower quadrant,

278
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,816
and you are dividing
the cecum with...

279
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,352
Forceps.

280
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,592
Lift free from the arachnoid.

281
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,862
Tacking sutures.

282
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,184
Patties.

283
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,404
Suction.

284
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:28,925
Starting over.

285
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,501
Here's your cup, all filled up.

286
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,607
- I'm eating here, Karev.
- It's fine, I washed my hands.

287
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,474
Did you talk to
Izzie about this yet?

288
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,827
Considering you
two are basically

289
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:50,181
conceiving a child together,
think you should talk with her?

290
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:53,066
Look, you said she
needed my... contribution.

291
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,519
Here's my
contribution. Whatever.

292
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,936
- Hi. How's Izzie?
- I don't know.

293
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,691
- How's Izzie?
- Why?

294
00:21:16,793 --> 00:21:20,244
- Have you been to see her?
- No, I've been working all day.

295
00:21:26,435 --> 00:21:28,468
- What?
- Have you been to see Izzie?

296
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,988
No. Haven't you?

297
00:21:41,283 --> 00:21:44,901
- You finished
that thing in one day?
- Had some free time.

298
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:49,473
- Had a lot of free time.
- Nobody came up to visit?

299
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:55,412
It's OK. If I were them, I wouldn't
want to step foot in this room either.

300
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,982
- You don't have
to keep checking on me.
- I do have to.

301
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,585
I have to start you on
this before your surgery.

302
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,921
Right. Surgery.

303
00:22:05,274 --> 00:22:08,609
And I wanted to tell you how
my surgery went this afternoon.

304
00:22:08,711 --> 00:22:12,580
- Colon guy?
- The colectomy went great,

305
00:22:12,682 --> 00:22:16,650
but I was in there,
and I see a mass.

306
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,319
You're kidding.
Was it a big mass?

307
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,687
Big enough. The size of a fist.

308
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,307
This is going to
burn a little at first,

309
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:25,287
but just for a few seconds.

310
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:29,346
So we had to mobilize the SMA

311
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:33,783
before we could resect the
thing and reconnect the bowel.

312
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,123
I wished Izzie
Stevens would die.

313
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:43,844
I wished her dead. Every
day, for I don't know how long.

314
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,413
I woke up every morning
wishing Izzie Stevens would die.

315
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:47,881
And now...

316
00:22:51,386 --> 00:22:53,386
What kind of person
wishes someone would die?

317
00:22:53,488 --> 00:22:57,224
What kind of doctor wishes...?
Knowing how things happen, what...?

318
00:23:00,863 --> 00:23:03,948
What kind of...? What
kind of doctor wishes...?

319
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:09,052
Are you in here, right
now, praying for Izzie to die?

320
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:13,006
No. I'm praying for her to live.

321
00:23:18,247 --> 00:23:19,847
- Clear!
- You know what?

322
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:22,316
- Wait outside!
- Will you let us know...?

323
00:23:22,418 --> 00:23:23,698
Yeah. I'll let you know.

324
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,515
- Bastards.
- Push one of epi.

325
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,707
Charge to 360. Clear!

326
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:34,378
Come on, Joyce, you old bag,
don't give 'em the satisfaction.

327
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,958
- Charge again.
- Charged.

328
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:39,983
Clear!

329
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:48,492
Hey. I'm Dr. Karev.

330
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,295
You're a fighter, you know
that? You worked hard today.

331
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:53,447
She needs some rest.

332
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:59,737
Make sure the family doesn't come
in. Give her a break from all the love.

333
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:03,473
No. They're impatient.

334
00:24:04,227 --> 00:24:06,727
It's been a long time.

335
00:24:10,233 --> 00:24:12,632
But they always come.

336
00:24:13,936 --> 00:24:15,519
They're my people.

337
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:19,039
People keep you going.

338
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:24,511
People are better
than no people.

339
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:39,125
Uh... It's not a good
time, he's still scrubbing in.

340
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,094
I know, it's just...
he should wear this.

341
00:24:41,196 --> 00:24:44,064
It's his ferryboat scrub
cap. He loves ferryboats.

342
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,858
- Meredith.
- What are you doing?

343
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,427
You're gonna have to re-scrub.

344
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:00,114
- I'm not ready.
- Yes, you are.

345
00:25:00,216 --> 00:25:02,882
I need to know that
at least I have you.

346
00:25:02,985 --> 00:25:05,586
No matter what happens in
there, I need you to say yes.

347
00:25:05,688 --> 00:25:07,232
- I need to know...
- I can't say yes.

348
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,017
Not if agreeing to
be with you forever

349
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:10,986
will make it OK if Izzie dies.

350
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:15,546
I can't say yes. I love
you, and you can do this.

351
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:18,432
You can do this. I know you can.

352
00:25:33,683 --> 00:25:34,948

I get why I haven't been camped out
at Izzie's bedside holding her hand...

369
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,950
- I'm not talking about this.
- Why not?

370
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:01,780
Maybe it's the fact
that I asked Izzie

371
00:27:01,804 --> 00:27:07,908
a hundred times what was
wrong, and she just ignored me.

372
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,711
Then there's the fact that
when she actually needed help,

373
00:27:10,813 --> 00:27:14,548
she trusted
Cristina, of all people!

374
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:16,883
And there's the fact that
she's your best friend,

375
00:27:16,985 --> 00:27:18,368
and she might die on you.

376
00:27:20,155 --> 00:27:22,322
There's also that.

377
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:33,400
Come on. We are
going to go wait for Izzie.

378
00:27:33,502 --> 00:27:37,320
George, you were my
husband and you slept with her.

379
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:40,340
You are the reason I wished
her dead. You owe me this.

380
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:43,276
You can lie to
yourself all you want,

381
00:27:43,378 --> 00:27:47,530
but I know you.
I loved you once.

382
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,900
And I know you care
if she lives or dies.

383
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:57,240
Surgery started.

384
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:05,048
- Hey, have they
started surgery yet?
- Yeah.

385
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,413
Dr. Grey? We were wondering,

386
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,237
did Dr. Stevens'
surgery start or...?

387
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:12,923
Keep it moving. No
loitering. That's the rule.

388
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,925
If they wanna
stay, let 'em stay.

389
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:19,095
People are better
than no people.

390
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:24,768
Clamp.

391
00:28:26,322 --> 00:28:28,655
I am ready to... No.

392
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,711
Yes. OK. I'm ready to buzz
the superficial temporal artery.

393
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:38,231
- Tenting sutures.
- There's no rush. Take your time.

394
00:28:38,334 --> 00:28:40,654
- Everyone is on your side.
- You sure that's gonna hold,

395
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,903
- with all the
friable scar tissue?
- Dr. Swender?

396
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,707
Actually, I saw Dr. Shepherd

397
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,959
do three different
craniotomies last month,

398
00:28:49,044 --> 00:28:53,013
each with easily double
the amount of friable tissue.

399
00:28:53,115 --> 00:28:55,182
They held just fine.

400
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,152
Next tenting suture, please.

401
00:29:00,855 --> 00:29:02,523
Clear!

402
00:29:04,025 --> 00:29:07,861
Push another epi. Charge again.
Come on, Mrs. Wallington. Clear!

403
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,594
I'm so sorry. She's
not responding.

404
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,770
We've done everything,
so she's gone.

405
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:21,858
Thank you. You
did a wonderful job.

406
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,068
- Are you kidding me?!
- Oh, God, this is
never gonna end!

407
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:35,588
No... No, she's gone.
She's really gone.

408
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,975
It's really gone.
It's her pacemaker.

409
00:29:38,077 --> 00:29:40,610
It's still firing. Makes it
seem like there's a heartbeat.

410
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:44,881
She's gone. Just
with a heartbeat.

411
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:48,351
- Are you sure she's dead,
young lady?
- I'm an intern.

412
00:29:48,436 --> 00:29:51,972
I'm not authorized to call time
of death in a situation like this.

413
00:29:52,074 --> 00:29:54,558
So I'm gonna get my superior.

414
00:29:54,643 --> 00:29:57,894
Excuse me. I'll be
right back. Excuse me.

415
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:07,182

- - Meredith...

416
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:09,673
- Choking.
- Stop.

417
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:12,475
- It's unacceptable.
- Back off.

418
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:16,780
- Hands around the neck.
- Ring thrown in your face.

419
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:27,591
This'll shut the pacemaker down.

420

00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:36,867

00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:47,897
<i>♪ You did what you needed to ♪</i>

502
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:51,101
This is a CT for Katie Bryce.

503
00:37:51,203 --> 00:37:53,970
16-year-old female,
subarachnoid aneurysm.

504
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:56,306
From a fall during
gymnastics. I remember.

505
00:37:56,408 --> 00:38:01,144
It was the first surgery we ever
scrubbed in together on. Our first save.

506
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:04,964
Right here is a cerebral
cyst. Tough save, but we did it.

507
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:08,234
I kissed you in the
stairwell after this surgery.

508
00:38:08,336 --> 00:38:10,870
This is where Dr. Bailey
kicked you out of the surgery

509
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:13,840
because she caught us
in your driveway in my car.

510
00:38:15,476 --> 00:38:18,244
And right here, this was
a seven-hour craniotomy.

511
00:38:18,346 --> 00:38:20,980
You held a clamp the entire
time and never flinched.

512
00:38:21,082 --> 00:38:25,068
That's when I knew you were
gonna be an incredible surgeon.

513
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,702
Beth Monroe,

514
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,339
who made our clinical
trial a success by surviving.

515
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:32,442
You talked me into
putting her under.

516
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,945
That's when I knew I needed you.

517
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:42,201
And this is today. Post-op
head CT of Izzie Stevens.

518
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:46,773
See that?

519
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:50,042
Right there. Tumor-free.

520
00:38:51,146 --> 00:38:55,832
Because of you. You
got me into the OR.

521
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:59,469
If there is a crisis,
you don't freeze.

522
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:01,203
You move forward.

523
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:03,384
You get the rest of
us to move forward

524
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:05,708
because you've seen worse,

525
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:10,629
you've survived worse. And
you know we'll survive too.

526
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:16,419
You say you're
all dark and twisty.

527
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,287
That's not a flaw.

528
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:21,608
It's a strength.

529
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:23,809
It makes you who you are.

530
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:29,148
I am not gonna get
down on one knee.

531
00:39:29,985 --> 00:39:32,505
I am not gonna ask a question.

532
00:39:34,022 --> 00:39:36,489
I love you, Meredith Grey.

533
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:41,394
And I want to spend the
rest of my life... with you.

I can't handle this after all.

545

It was out of line.
