1
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:12,311
<i>Doctors spend a lot of
time focused on the future.</i>

2
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:15,080
<i>Planning it.</i>

3
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,949
<i>Working toward it.</i>

4
00:00:23,307 --> 00:00:26,158
<i>But, at some point,
you start to realize</i>

5
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,842
<i>your life is happening now.</i>

6
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:31,246
- Any changes overnight?
- No.

7
00:00:31,348 --> 00:00:36,484
<i>Not after med school, not
after residency. Right now.</i>

8
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:39,637
<i>This is it. It's here.</i>

9
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,959
<i>Blink, and you'll miss it.</i>

10
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,079
That's the chief. Somebody
better make a coffee run.

11
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:49,898
You all look like hell.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,901
I gotta be in surgery
in ten minutes. Um...

13
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:56,771
- Mer, will you let me know...
- Yeah.

14
00:00:56,874 --> 00:00:58,794
We should go too. It's
probably gonna be a while.

15
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:03,429
Shepherd said she'd wake up.
What'd he tell you? Was that all crap?

16
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:08,066
- What did he say?
- He said it may be a while.

17
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,123
She's gonna wake up.

18
00:01:15,225 --> 00:01:17,142

26
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:43,168
Stevens still isn't awake and
I'm having something of a day,

27
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,172
even aside from that, so
don't take my face personally.

28
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,242
- It's just my face today.
- Did you tell her?

29
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:54,045
Uh, you should tell her. And
don't take her face personally.

30
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:58,283
OK. Well, on behalf of the
Department of Pediatric Surgery,

31
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:01,186
welcome to the fellowship
program. You're in!

32
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,489
- We're gonna
get you wheelie sneaks!
- Congratulations.

33
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:14,082
All right, I know I didn't
support you during this process.

34
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:17,969
In any event, I am
behind you now.

35
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:24,692
I'm trying to be a big person here.
How about you meet me halfway?

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,185
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

37
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:36,872
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

38
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:39,240
I have a headache.

39
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:42,894
You're up.

40
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,014
You're up and you're talking.

41
00:02:46,116 --> 00:02:48,283
You talked, right?

42
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:50,485
- Talk!
- Ow...

43
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,721
I said I have a
headache, stop yelling.

44
00:02:52,823 --> 00:02:54,303
- Page Shepherd!
- Ow.

45
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,740
Sorry.

46
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,515
Hey. What's with
hugging O'Malley?

47
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:08,536
I slept, Cristina. Last night.
I slept for the first time...

48
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:13,058
- I slept.
- Hugging O'Malley
because you slept?

49
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,128
I hugged O'Malley because he's got
great news which I will let him tell you.

50
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:22,300
But yeah, I guess, yeah, maybe
I hugged him because I slept.

51
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:26,037
And that's because of you. You came
with me to see my mom, and then I slept.

52
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:30,509
And I slept without nightmares.
That's not a small thing, Cristina.

53
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:33,545
That... That is everything.

54
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:37,098
I can be a better man. I
can be a better man for you.

55
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,702
I hope, if you'll let me,

56
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,138
I can be a better man with you.

57
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:48,860
Don't say anything. Just
think about it. OK? OK.

58
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:58,220
- Bailey? I need
to tell you something.
- Not now, O'Malley.

59
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:01,362
It'll be quick. I got to get to
the OR to scrub in with the chief.

60
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:05,627
I think you're gonna be mad at first.
But I'm about to do something important,

61
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:08,696
and I'm very sure
about this decision.

62
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:13,235
And I think eventually you're gonna
be proud but, you know, before that,

63
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,837
you're probably gonna
be like "What did you do?"

64
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,357
- I don't mean to imitate.
- You call that quick?

65
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:21,659
I joined the Army to be a trauma
surgeon. I report for duty tomorrow.

66
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:28,282
- You did what?!
- That's where
I thought we'd start.

67
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:30,919
- Something's going on
with George.
- What?

68
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,255
Owen hugged him.
They were happy.

69
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,541
We don't hug when we're happy.

70
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,811
- Are you better?
- What?

71
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:44,499
You know, with your therapy or
whatever. You said you got well.

72
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:48,336
Well are you? Better?
Or are you just fake better?

73
00:04:48,438 --> 00:04:52,057
- What do you mean?
- I'm asking you if people...

74
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:55,960
I mean, are you actually
different? Do you feel different?

75
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,213
I'm getting married today.

76
00:04:59,616 --> 00:05:02,184
City Hall. No muss, no
fuss. Just quick and dirty.

77
00:05:02,286 --> 00:05:06,704
- Uh... Do you want me to come?
- No, no. Just letting you know.

78
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,757
Wait. Uh... Uh...

79
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:12,260
OK. This is my
grocery list: it's old.

80
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:15,263
Uh, this is new. Um...

81
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:19,250
This is my favorite pen,
so I want it back. Borrowed.

82
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:22,420
All of it's blue,
so you're covered.

83
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,707
Now see, if we were George
and Owen, we would hug right now.

84
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,250
Dude!

85
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:38,986
Unidentified male, dragged by a bus.
Clamped down so we couldn't intubate.

86
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,339
- Didn't they stop?
- Bus driver didn't know

87
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:45,093
- till they got halfway
down the block.
- Is he gonna be OK?

88
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,179
OK, I'll take over CPR.

89
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,015
Push 20 of etomidate
and 100 of sux.

90
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:58,440
He saved my life. The bus was gonna
hit me, he threw me out of the way.

91
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:01,776
- Grey, get her out of here.
- Was supposed to be me
under the bus.

92
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:04,629
He's alone. They don't
even know who he is. Please!

93
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:06,782
Stand over there
and just don't move.

94
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:08,850
- He's back.
- Let's get a trauma series,

95
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:13,288
trauma labs and O-neg blood in
here. Severe injury to the left forearm.

96
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,048
- Skull's bashed in. Page Shepherd!
- And Sloan.

97
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,034
Start antibiotics and start
cleaning out those wounds.

98
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,880
Uh...

99
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:30,922
Now can you get her out of here?

100
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,561
Did you get the whole thing?

101
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:39,898
- Did you get
the whole tumor out?
- Just let me finish my exam.

102
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,334
- Can you tell me your name?
- My name is Isobel Stevens,

103
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:45,470
it's 2009

104
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:49,807
and I'm in the Neuro ICU
at Seattle Grace Hospital.

105
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,793
- Did you get
the damn thing out?
- Got the whole damn thing.

106
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,397
- You got it!
- Yeah.

107
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,217
Oh, God, you got
the whole thing.

108
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:03,154
And I can talk and I know
my name. And I'm not a turnip!

109
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:07,525
- Nope.
- No offense,
you are a great surgeon,

110
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,128
but I really thought I
was gonna be a turnip.

111
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:15,467
- This is so unbelievably great!
- Your kidneys are a little
sluggish,

112
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,970
so we're gonna keep an eye on
your electrolytes for a few hours.

113
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:22,891
- Your post-op crit was fine.
- OK, good.

114
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:24,893
Good.

115
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:31,750
How'd the surgery go?

116
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:34,920
Did you get the brain
tumor? Did you get it out?

117
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:37,756
Iz, you just asked him
that. We just talked about it.

118
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:41,776
No, no. It's OK. She's gonna be
foggy for a while. The tumor's out.

119
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:45,179
There was a little
bleeding during the post.

120
00:07:45,282 --> 00:07:47,181
- You got it?
- Yeah.

121
00:07:47,284 --> 00:07:49,050
All of it?

122
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:51,786
That's amazing!

123
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:55,923
Derek Shepherd, you are a hero!

124
00:07:56,042 --> 00:08:01,312
And I know that that's Derek
Shepherd, and you're Alex.

125
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,264
And you should kiss me.

126
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:09,737
Alex, I don't have
a brain tumor.

127
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,374
- I'm tumor free.
- Yes, you are.

128
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,931
What's wrong?

129
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:23,534
- Why do you look weird?
- Nothing. Nothing.

130
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,237
Your kidneys are a little
slow. We're gonna watch them.

131
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:31,943
OK, you'll re-check my
electrolytes in an hour. OK.

132
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,579
How did the surgery go?

133
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,166
Did you get the tumor?

134
00:08:42,306 --> 00:08:44,439
We did.

135
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,041
Tumor's gone.

136
00:08:46,143 --> 00:08:48,944
There was a little bit of
bleeding and we took care of that.

137
00:08:49,046 --> 00:08:51,212
- You got it?
- Mm-hm.

138
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,733
Oh, my God!

139
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:58,469
And I can talk and
you didn't kill me.

140
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,940
What's wrong with you people?
We should be celebrating.

141
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,493
She's like the woman who couldn't
remember her husband was dead.

142
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:13,367
- We had to keep telling her.
- Could be a normal haze.

143
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:18,256
Or the bleeding blitzed her short-term
retention. Did you screw up her brain?

144
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:22,227
Karev... I'll be back.
Try and stay calm.

145
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,729
Freaking her out
is not gonna help.

146
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,036
Wake up.

147
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,450
Whoa.

148
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:36,257
- Man versus bus.
- Bus won.

149
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:37,625
Check out the left arm.

150
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,847
- He's crashing again!
- What do we got?

151
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,966
- Roadkill.
- You mind?

152
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:47,852
Stepped in front of a bus to pull
a woman out of the way. Hero.

153
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:50,332
- Can you can fix the arm?
- If it's gonna happen,

154
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,802
- gotta be in the next few hours.
- - Pupil's blown.

155
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,927
Get me a cranial drill. Grey,
want to practice your burr holes?

156
00:09:57,113 --> 00:09:58,913
Stabilize his neck, please.

157
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,002
Give me a ten-blade.

158
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,539
Give me the drill. Go in
slowly. Feel a grab, stop.

159
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,341
Otherwise, you'll hit brain.

160
00:10:11,294 --> 00:10:12,977
Let's go, quickly.

161
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,484
- OK!
- That's it!

162
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:26,374
Nice work, Dr. Grey.

163
00:10:26,476 --> 00:10:28,626
I'm gonna get some
Bacitracin for that face.

164
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,795
- Let's get his head rotated.
- Easy.

165
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:34,532
Welcome back, sir. You had
us worried there for a minute.

166
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,856
- You think he's gonna make it?
- I hope so.

167
00:10:43,693 --> 00:10:45,760
He really has to make it.

168
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:51,399
- Dr. Sloan.
- There's gonna
be too much tension.

169
00:10:51,501 --> 00:10:53,434
Start over and do
a layered closure.

170
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:55,070
Um...

171
00:10:55,172 --> 00:10:58,739
Can I ask a question about that?

172
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:09,234
OK, you brought up moving in
together and marriage, and I put it off,

173
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,736
now you're embarrassed
and won't make eye contact

174
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,088
because you feel I
have all the power.

175
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,675
But I don't want all the
power. I'm happy to share it.

176
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,161
Can we just skip this part?

177
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:24,365
Get some 4-0 Vicryl so you
can redo your patient's sutures.

178
00:11:30,673 --> 00:11:34,091
I'll totally pretend I
didn't hear any of that.

179
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,555
Women do this to
me. I don't do this.

180
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:39,680
- "Let's get a house."
- Sucks being the girl.

181
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,516
I'm not the girl.

182
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,286
What do girls do?

183
00:11:45,388 --> 00:11:50,641
Well, we start with the cold
shoulder, so you're right on track.

184
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:53,194
Then we go to our
girlfriends and we bitch.

185
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,114
And our girlfriends say,
"You want to build a future,

186
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,951
build it yourself.
You don't need...

187
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:05,123
a man to give you that. You
want to buy a house? Buy a house."

188
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,744
Huh. You're good at this.

189
00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:14,065
I ought to help someone get
a love life. I suck at my own.

190
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:18,953
He jumped in front
of a bus for me.

191
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,007
- What did you do to O'Malley?
- Excuse me?

192
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,943
Somebody else here likely to
convince someone to join the Army

193
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:29,030
- and be a trauma surgeon
in Iraq?
- What? Army?

194
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:31,716
What?

195
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:34,018
- V-fib!
- Charge the paddles to 360!

196
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,960
- Call who you have
to and undo this.
- Bailey, busy here.

197
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,851
- Clear!
- George O'Malley?

198
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,208
- It wasn't my idea!
- No change.

199
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,195
- Charge again.
- Clear!

200
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:49,083
I gave him a decent education in trauma.
I didn't know he was gonna go enlist.

201
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,637
- He keeps coding.
- Open-book pelvic fracture.

202
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:56,424
Too much bleeding. We take him
to an OR now, he'll die on the table.

203
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:59,494
He needs to go to Angio if
we're gonna stop the bleeding.

204
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:02,296
Sinus tach. We have a rhythm.
Barely there, but it's there.

205
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,976
Let's stabilize the pelvis.

206
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,778
I know what goes
on in this hospital.

207
00:13:05,802 --> 00:13:09,470
I know you're messed up from
that war. And not in a small way.

208
00:13:09,572 --> 00:13:10,855
Get him out of it.

209
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:15,409
Page me if you need
me. I've got other patients.

210
00:13:17,313 --> 00:13:19,947
How'd you piss
off all the women?

211
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:24,719
- Let's get our guy to Angio.
- Angio? He's barely got
a pulse!

212
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,688
It's now or never, if we
want him to live. Move!

213
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:34,428
I know it's tough, but I'd be grateful
if you'd stay alive for a few minutes.

214
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,469
Maybe we're bouncier in
peds than general surgery,

215
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:45,740
but I thought there would be a
"Yay!" or some jumping around.

216
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:50,311
You look pretty dour for someone
about to start a highly prized fellowship.

217
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:54,698
You are about to start a
highly prized fellowship, right?

218
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,813
Hey, I've got a plan to
stop George. You in?

219
00:13:56,837 --> 00:14:00,455
- Stop George from what?
- He joined the Army. Yes, I'm in.

220
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:05,043
Bailey! I'm talking to you...

221
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:07,865
- Why are you trying
to stop him?
- He joined the Army.

222
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:11,499
- And?
- And because he's my ex-husband

223
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,567
and I know his mom
and I love his mom.

224
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:17,305
And normally, Izzie would talk
sense into him, but she's got cancer

225
00:14:17,407 --> 00:14:20,674
and kind of a bad mental
deficit, so it's on me to stop him.

226
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,755
- Why would you want to?
- He joined the Army.

227
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,880
- Don't you think
that's a problem?
- I think that's awesome.

228
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:28,249
Awesome?

229
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,328
- You gonna chew?
- My dragged under
a bus guy's in Angio.

230
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,297
They're gonna page me.
How's Izzie? Retaining anything?

231
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:46,117
- No.
- OK.

232
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:50,271
Uh, at 6pm, your idiotic
colleague George O'Malley

233
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:52,213
will finish his
surgery with the chief.

234
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:55,743
At 6pm, you will be standing beside
us in the OR hallway prepared to join

235
00:14:55,845 --> 00:14:58,074
- in an intervention.
- - What polite company call

236
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:01,048
an intervention, though
I'm not sure interventions

237
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,983
involve whupping
people on the behinds

238
00:15:03,085 --> 00:15:05,685
- with a belt.
- What? He's got
a drinking problem now?

239
00:15:05,722 --> 00:15:07,165
- He joined the Army.
- What?

240
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:10,057
Double O Seven? He can't
go, he's the guy that gets killed.

241
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,692
Gets killed cleaning
his own gun.

242
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:14,695
Grey is going to coax
him back as a loving friend,

243
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:19,133
you're gonna use logic and reason
to point out the idiocy of his ways,

244
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:23,204
Stevens will make sad cancer
eyes, and if all of that doesn't work,

245
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:27,608
Karev, you pull out your "I was raised
out back with the trash cans" roots

246
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,695
- and just beat
the crap out of him.
- Six o'clock.

247
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,263
Six o'clock.

248
00:15:39,222 --> 00:15:41,255
Hey, there.

249
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:45,726
I know this must be scary. If it's any
consolation, you're a hardcore hero.

250
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:48,012
You saved that woman's life.

251
00:15:55,638 --> 00:15:57,805
Is he trying to write something?

252
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,296
Can you hold this?

253
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:17,958
OK. You'll be stronger tomorrow.

254
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,227
Call OR 1, tell them
to get ready for him.

255
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:21,595
OK.

256
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,167
Amanda, you can't be out here.

257
00:16:28,271 --> 00:16:31,138
Would you want to be all
alone at a time like this?

258
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,559
We had 30 seconds of
interaction before he saved my life,

259
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:39,213
and I wasn't even nice.

260
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:44,017
I was standing on
a corner when this

261
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,421
ordinary-looking guy
stands next to me and smiles.

262
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:52,526
And... And I'm so busy
scoping for someone hotter,

263
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:58,382
that... I don't even
give him a second look.

264
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,867
Next thing I know, he throws
me out of the way of a bus

265
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,805
I'm about to walk in front of
and almost gets himself killed.

266
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:09,910
He literally... he
swept me off my feet.

267
00:17:10,013 --> 00:17:12,897
That is my prince in that bed.

268
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:18,035
OK. You can stay until
they take him to surgery.

269
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,283
Not a good time.

270
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,519
Walk away from me again, I will
grab you by the hair and pull hard.

271
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,472
I grew up with the name
Arizona. I learned how to play dirty.

272
00:17:38,574 --> 00:17:40,558
I stuck my neck out for
you. You were my pick.

273
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,477
And I appreciate that.
But it's a big decision.

274
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:47,381
It's not, it's the brass ring. It's the
most exclusive, most competitive

275
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,617
and we're as good as it gets.
Nobody lands this thing and says "no."

276
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,856
My husband informed me yesterday
that if I accept the peds fellowship,

277
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:59,060
if I sign on for another
two years of training

278
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,145
and the hours and
workload that come with it,

279
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:06,250
when I could be a general surgery
attending and make it home for dinner,

280
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:08,118
he will divorce me.

281
00:18:09,606 --> 00:18:11,706
It's a big decision.

282
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,350
Gonna have a hard
time saving that arm.

283
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:32,042
I can get him back to full
function if I can get there in time.

284
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:34,044
- Thinking about buying a house.
- Good.

285
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:38,132
Meredith and I are gonna
go to City Hall this afternoon.

286
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:42,069
- Getting married.
- Really? That's great news.

287
00:18:42,171 --> 00:18:45,523
- If I could
just save Stevens...
- You're allowed to be happy.

288
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,809
You're allowed to get married.
You've earned that right.

289
00:18:48,911 --> 00:18:52,513
Congratulations, you lucky
bastard. Come here, give me a hug.

290
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:58,002
- Why is everyone hugging today?
- The blushing bride.

291
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:00,004
Here's the plan
for our John Doe.

292
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:03,674
Shepherd, evacuate the epidural,
Grey and I correct internal injuries.

293
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,043
Torres will place
the internal fixator.

294
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:10,480
Sloan should work on the arm if
the patient doesn't get too acidotic.

295
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:14,618
- You think he has a shot?
- I've seen people come back
from worse.

296
00:19:19,175 --> 00:19:22,276
- Hey. I thought
you were in surgery.
- I'm on my way.

297
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:24,328
You talked to Bailey
about peds and Tucker?

298
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,581
No. I talked to Bailey about
the Army thing and George.

299
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:31,151
Are you upset with me?

300
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,053
No. I'm awesome.

301
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:37,241
- Calliope...
- No. Do not "Calliope" me.

302
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:41,128
You said it was awesome.
George, sweet, kind George,

303
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:44,799
who can't even kill a fly is
joining the Army to go to Iraq

304
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:46,934
- and you said awesome.
- It is. Awesome.

305
00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:51,088
No, it is not awesome!
God! Who are you?

306
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:55,654
- How's the arm?
- Nerves are intact,

307
00:19:55,678 --> 00:19:59,346
- just have to reattach these vessels.
- - You ready for me?

308
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:02,333
I'm almost done with the
major internal crush injuries.

309
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,818
Pelvis will be all yours.
Get me some more laps.

310
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,639
You think you could do it? Step in
front of a bus for a perfect stranger?

311
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:10,508
We'd all like to
think we would...

312
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,354
More or less what
Hunt's been doing

313
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,858
- every day
for the last couple years.
- No. The guys did.

314
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:18,965
I just came in behind them with a
dustpan and broom and swept up.

315
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:22,736
You sewed up soldiers
under fire. You didn't sweep up.

316
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:29,977
How do you think O'Malley's gonna
do over there? Think he can handle it?

317
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,963
- No, I don't.
- I think he's gonna
surprise us all.

318
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,976
He's coming back in a body bag.

319
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,762
I think you all
should just shut up.

320
00:20:36,786 --> 00:20:38,219
Just shut the hell up.

321
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,973
Please, shut up.

322
00:20:47,596 --> 00:20:52,817
"Shepherd got your whole
tumor out." Oh, my God!

323
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,703
Alex, why didn't you
tell me? Oh, my God!

324
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,272
- Oh.
- We're working on it.

325
00:20:58,374 --> 00:21:00,775
Remember what time
you woke up this morning?

326
00:21:00,877 --> 00:21:01,975
Um...

327
00:21:02,078 --> 00:21:04,545
- Not exactly.
- 7:45.

328
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:07,198
7:45. "O'Malley
joined the Army?"

329
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,683
Gonna be a trauma
surgeon in Iraq.

330
00:21:09,785 --> 00:21:13,471
- When'd you wake up?
- 7:45. He's gonna get killed.

331
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:17,374
- We're dealing with it.
- Did you know about this George thing?

332
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:20,678
Yup. Cannon fodder. I'm just
gonna take some more blood.

333
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,682
Last time we checked, your potassium
was 6.3. When'd you wake up?

334
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:30,237
- Um, early,
I can't quite remember.
- 7:45.6.3, 7:45.

335
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:37,077
- "O'Malley joined
the Army?" George?
- We're dealing with it.

336
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:39,263
- What's your potassium?
- I...

337
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:43,200
- Iz, what's your potassium?
- - Give her the chart to read

338
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:47,888
and try and memorize, OK? I can
talk to you about her hyperkalemia.

339
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,883
She had brain surgery, and an
incredibly aggressive course of IL-2.

340
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:01,786
- She needs rest.
- She needs to exercise memory

341
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:05,689
- before it all turns to mush.
- Not with you barking orders
at her.

342
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,559
- Butt out.
- I don't care
if you're her husband.

343
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,756
Want to see how fast I can get
your visiting hours down to zero?

344
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,713
She signed a DNR.
She signed a friggin' DNR

345
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:17,334
and made me promise she'd come out
of this with a life. Not in a hospital bed.

346
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,120
Not with no brain. I had to
promise she'd have a life.

347
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:22,856
You want to know what happens
if she can't make new memories?

348
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:26,560
Forget about being a doctor. She'll
need round the clock babysitters.

349
00:22:26,662 --> 00:22:29,563
We get an apartment, she
can't find her way to the toilet!

350
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:32,733
Tracker on her ankle in case
she wanders out the front door!

351
00:22:32,835 --> 00:22:36,487
Alex. You can handle
this. She will get better.

352
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,956
Maybe, maybe not.

353
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:42,175
It's on me. Her future is on me.

354
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:53,554
- Is he gonna be OK?
- We'll know more
in the morning.

355
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,909
Go ahead.

356
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:18,345
How's she doing? Any better?

357
00:23:20,783 --> 00:23:23,801
- No.
- Damn.

358
00:23:24,854 --> 00:23:28,155
Well, I'm going to City Hall

359
00:23:28,257 --> 00:23:31,308
- to go do the thing.
- Seriously?

360
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,894
It doesn't seem
like the day for it.

361
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:39,216
Look at Alex. He's in there
working so hard all day.

362
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:42,519
And she doesn't know.
And if she stays like this,

363
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:46,006
she may never know how much
he loves her. And that girl Amanda?

364
00:23:46,108 --> 00:23:51,328
She's in there loving a stranger.
She thinks that's her Prince Charming.

365
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:54,931
He's probably gonna
die today. Chances are.

366
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:58,619
So, yeah, I'm gonna go get
married. Because I think it's important

367
00:23:58,721 --> 00:24:02,406
to take the time to tell the people
you love how much you love them

368
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:04,575
while they can hear you.

369
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:17,921
I love you, Cristina Yang.

370
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:28,032
- You have changed.
- Maybe I have.

371
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,271
- What?
- I'm gonna hug you.

372
00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:50,570
Maybe I don't understand
people. I don't see things.

373
00:24:50,672 --> 00:24:53,757
Maybe I just don't get what's
going on with you or why you're mad,

374
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:57,394
but I think it's awesome. George
joining the Army is awesome.

375
00:24:57,479 --> 00:25:00,297
- Shut up!
- Um, no.

376
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:03,234
You asked me who I was.
I am a person who thinks

377
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:07,054
that what George is doing is
dangerous and terrifying and brave.

378
00:25:07,156 --> 00:25:10,490
He's going to serve his country.
He's going to risk his life to save

379
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:15,245
the men and women who make it possible
for you and I to sleep in our beds.

380
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,349
I am a person who
thinks that that is brave.

381
00:25:18,451 --> 00:25:22,019
And I am a person who
stood in an airplane hangar

382
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:26,223
and watched them unload
my brother's body in a coffin,

383
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:28,759
and all we got was a flag.

384
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:34,698
My brother died over there because
there weren't enough doctors.

385
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,918
So for my money, George
O'Malley is a patriot. He's a hero.

386
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:44,158
And I am grateful that he exists.
So, yeah, the word I use is "awesome."

387
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,959
That's who I am.

388
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:55,819
I'm sorry.

389
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:06,630
- I'm sorry...
- Wait!

390
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,663
I love... you.

391
00:26:27,236 --> 00:26:29,036
- I... I love you too.
- No.

392
00:26:29,138 --> 00:26:30,418
Just...

393
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:35,259
I love you.

394
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:40,931
I said I love you!

395
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,700
Me.

396
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,703
Cristina Yang!

397
00:26:52,461 --> 00:26:55,812
- You traumatized me.
- I didn't know... I'm so sorry.

398
00:26:55,914 --> 00:27:00,550
No, damn it, not about the choking.
You come here and you pull out my icicle

399
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,752
and you make me
love you and I can't...

400
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:07,708
I don't want to...
I can't breathe...

401
00:27:08,977 --> 00:27:11,011
without you.

402
00:27:14,983 --> 00:27:17,467
You can do this,
Cristina. We can do this.

403
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:20,854
All you have to do
is meet me halfway.

404
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,008
All you have to do is say "yes."

405
00:27:28,096 --> 00:27:30,380
All you have to do is say "yes."

406
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,321
- What's your crit?
- Ugh.

407
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:43,427
This is disgusting. I can't
believe we serve it to the patients.

408
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:46,930
"You keep asking for
lime Jell-O and don't like it."

409
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,015
So stop giving it to me.

410
00:27:49,117 --> 00:27:50,317
You get mad if I don't.

411
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:54,354
- OK. Now what's your crit?
- I don't know.

412
00:27:54,456 --> 00:27:57,541
- I'm tired.
- What's O'Malley
doing tomorrow?

413
00:27:57,643 --> 00:27:59,242
Joining the Army.

414
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,263
- I need a break.
- You don't think
I need a break?

415
00:28:03,365 --> 00:28:07,200
- Suck it up.
- God!

416
00:28:07,303 --> 00:28:11,738
Back off. I'm sorry
if this is hard for you,

417
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,109
but you are not the one with
the short-term memory of a carrot.

418
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:25,468
Hey, go ahead, get it off your chest.
It's not like I'm gonna remember.

419
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,505
I'm not the one with the carrot
brain, but I'm married to it.

420
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:33,726
Some wedding we walked into, because
we thought you'd be dead in a week.

421
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:36,062
You made me promise
you wouldn't live like this.

422
00:28:36,165 --> 00:28:39,199
What am I supposed to do?
Smother you with a pillow?

423
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:43,269
Shoot you up with an overdose of
morphine? Not really psyched about that.

424
00:28:43,372 --> 00:28:47,107
Leave you? Not psyched about that,
either. So I'm kind of screwed, right?

425
00:28:47,209 --> 00:28:50,877
Not as bad as you, but not a
friggin' walk in the park either!

426
00:28:58,053 --> 00:28:59,952
I'm sorry, Iz.

427
00:29:00,055 --> 00:29:05,291
No, I told you to get it
off your chest. You did.

428
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,917
Did you forget yet?

429
00:29:14,637 --> 00:29:16,202
Nope.

430
00:29:16,304 --> 00:29:18,505
Not yet, give me a minute.

431
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:31,034
Um...

432
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:36,023
If there's still a spot for me in
general surgery, I'd like to take it.

433
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:40,027
I spent months trying to talk
you off peds, I finally get on board,

434
00:29:40,129 --> 00:29:44,047
- and you change your mind?
- Tucker gave me an ultimatum.

435
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:47,066
The fellowship or our marriage.

436
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:53,674
- You chose your marriage.
- No, I'm leaving him.

437
00:29:53,775 --> 00:29:57,711
Because a marriage that resorts
to ultimatums is not a marriage.

438
00:29:57,813 --> 00:30:01,047
I mean what kind of
husband does that?

439
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:06,303
So I'm going to be a single mom.

440
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:10,924
It's not the time
for new specialties.

441
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:14,578
Damn!

442
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:19,900
I'm sorry. It's just the first
time I've said it out loud.

443
00:30:20,002 --> 00:30:22,636
It kind of took the
wind out of me.

444
00:30:24,006 --> 00:30:30,060
Miranda, are you sure about
this? He might come around.

445
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,463
- He's just scared.
- We're all scared!

446
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:36,800
If you're not scared,
you're not paying attention!

447
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:41,388
One of my residents just signed
up to go to war! That's scary!

448
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:44,841
Another one almost
lost her life to melanoma,

449
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,010
and doesn't know what
day it is! That's scary!

450
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:50,280
What Tucker's
facing isn't scary!

451
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:53,350
He's just weak!

452
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:03,176
A pat on the back
isn't gonna help, sir.

453
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:06,412
Should I go?

454
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:11,752
OK.

455
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,172
OK.

456
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:21,627
I'll just stand here with
you, if that's all right.

457
00:31:21,729 --> 00:31:25,265
Yes, sir. That would be fine.

458
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,495
I thought you were
operating on John Doe.

459
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:44,434
I already did. I'm looking at houses.
One has a stone fireplace which I like.

460
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:47,337
This one has a backyard
the size of Montana.

461
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:51,924
- Uh-huh. You're buying a house?
- Yeah.

462
00:31:52,027 --> 00:31:55,345
Right. OK.

463
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:59,032
I'm buying a house. Right now. It's a
buyers' market and I'm buying a house.

464
00:31:59,134 --> 00:32:02,685
The only reason you're even talking
about a house is to make me feel bad.

465
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:07,490
You're trying to prove you're moving
on without me so I'll change my mind.

466
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,804
This what women are doing
when they say they're moving on?

467
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:12,596
Yeah. They don't usually
take out a home loan to do it.

468
00:32:12,698 --> 00:32:16,149
Pathetic. Let me be
clear. I'm moving on.

469
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:19,886
I'm a better woman than you.

470
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:26,559
- Ready to go?
- I just got a page.

471
00:32:26,661 --> 00:32:28,495
Our John Doe needs
to go back into surgery.

472
00:32:28,597 --> 00:32:33,199
Post-op CT showed a re-bleed.
I'm gonna have Nelson take care of it.

473
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:35,618
- No. Really?
- I'd prefer to do it myself,

474
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,773
but I wanna check in on Izzie. We
can do that first then get married after?

475
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:44,060
- We have the George
intervention after.
- I'll have Nelson do it.

476
00:32:44,145 --> 00:32:45,785
Tell them to prep.
We'll run to City Hall,

477
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:48,481
- we'll come back
and we'll do it.
- Meredith.

478
00:32:48,584 --> 00:32:51,350
No. Let's go. We gotta go.
We gotta run to City Hall,

479
00:32:51,453 --> 00:32:54,137
come back, check on
Izzie, we'll monitor John Doe,

480
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:57,340
- talk George out of the Army...
- We could do this another day.

481
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:00,726
There is no other day!
Every day is like this.

482
00:33:00,828 --> 00:33:03,830
Every day there's a
crisis. There's no time.

483
00:33:03,932 --> 00:33:07,768
- Meredith...
- I love you. I wanna marry you today.

484
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:10,536
But there is no time.

485
00:33:16,612 --> 00:33:19,612
- You have a piece of paper?
- For what?

486
00:33:19,714 --> 00:33:23,716
I wanna be with you forever,
and you wanna be with me forever.

487
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:27,454
And in order to do that,
we need to make vows,

488
00:33:27,556 --> 00:33:30,707
a commitment, a contract.

489
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:36,312
- Give me a piece of paper.
- I don't... I don't.

490
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:39,316
I have Post-its.

491
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:41,551
OK.

492
00:33:46,392 --> 00:33:48,052
What do we want to
promise each other?

493
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:50,510
<i>♪ Seems to hide ♪</i>

494
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:56,149
<i>♪ Deep inside your mind ♪</i>

495
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:01,087
That you'll love me
even when you hate me.

496
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:06,292
To love each other even
when we hate each other.

497
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:13,550
No running, ever. Nobody walks
out. No matter what happens.

498
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,236
- No running.
- What else?

499
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:22,108
That we'll take care of each other even
when we're old and smelly and senile.

500
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:26,563
If I get Alzheimer's
and forget you...

501
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:30,349
I will remind you
who I am every day.

502
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:35,689
To take care when
old, senile, smelly.

503
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:40,526
This... is forever.

504
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:46,349
Sign.

505
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,936
- This is our wedding? A Post-it?
- Mm-hm.

506
00:34:50,038 --> 00:34:51,571
Well, if you sign it.

507
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,523

Now I kiss the bride.

512
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:17,063
<i>♪ What a feeling ♪</i>

513
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:22,435
- Married?
- Married.

514
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:28,725
See that?

515
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,529
Plenty of time.

516
00:35:38,286 --> 00:35:42,288
- Gotta do an EKG.
- I don't even get
any small talk?

517
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:45,653
- What's your problem?
- I'll tell you.

518
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:49,612
I know I'm supposed to be
grateful for my new lease on life.

519
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:54,885
But Alex marched in here and
basically told me that being married to me

520
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:58,521
was the worst thing that
ever happened to him. Yeah.

521
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,791
And that he was trying to decide
if smothering me with a pillow

522
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:05,662
was the best way to put
us both out of our misery.

523
00:36:11,486 --> 00:36:14,737
- OK, where is it?
- Where's what?

524
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,417
Where's the note that says that?

525
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:19,108
- Did you write that down?
- No.

526
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,713
No!

527
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:31,334
I'll be right there.

528
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,748
Yes.

529
00:36:42,584 --> 00:36:45,151
Yes!

530
00:36:45,253 --> 00:36:48,655
- I've gotta go. I've gotta find Alex.
- Go.

531
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:58,314
Oh. Sorry. I was looking
for George. It's after six.

532
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,617
Uh, we scheduled an intervention

533
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:05,020
so we could give O'Malley a piece of
our minds about this idiotic Army business.

534
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:08,742
- Did he leave already?
- He never scrubbed in.

535
00:37:08,844 --> 00:37:11,827
He told me he was enlisting, I
sent him home to spend the day

536
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:16,248
with his mom since he's leaving
so soon. He took off this morning.

537
00:37:22,724 --> 00:37:25,374
- How's his ICP?
- Worse. OR's expecting us.

538
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:28,494
- I thought you were
getting married.
- We did.

539
00:37:28,596 --> 00:37:31,281
Sure you want to start
your honeymoon in an OR?

540
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:33,133
We're sure.

541
00:37:34,903 --> 00:37:38,454
You can't be in here. I'll come
get you in the waiting room.

542
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:42,625
Hold his hand until you put him
under. It does make him feel better.

543
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:43,843
OK.

544
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,120
Well, you made a
good friend there.

545
00:37:54,222 --> 00:37:56,856
That happens when you
take a bus for somebody.

546
00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:04,213
OK. I know this is scary. But
you do have a great team up there.

547
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:08,051
You wanna try to write again?

548
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:13,073
Can you hold the pen? No?

549
00:38:13,175 --> 00:38:15,107
OK. O?

550
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:17,393
O.

551
00:38:20,348 --> 00:38:22,381
Seven?

552
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,275
Double O... Seven.

553
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:43,002
Oh, God! Oh, God!

554
00:38:46,974 --> 00:38:49,242
- You paged. What do you need?
- Way to go dipwad.

555
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,377
Telling your wife
you're trying to off her?

556
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:54,447
Mind your business... Wait.

557
00:38:54,549 --> 00:38:57,483
- How did you know that?
- She told me.

558
00:38:59,721 --> 00:39:01,221
You remember?

559
00:39:02,224 --> 00:39:04,758
Pillow or morphine.
I got the whole thing.

560
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,110
- I didn't mean that.
- Of course you didn't.

561
00:39:07,195 --> 00:39:10,646
You love me too much to shoot me
up with morphine even if I asked you to.

562
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:14,283
And my stupid gorked
brain is coming back.

563
00:39:14,386 --> 00:39:16,731
Oh, my God, I was so scared.

564
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:19,972
I mean, I would have
loved you no matter what.

565
00:39:20,742 --> 00:39:23,426
You're back. You're back.

566
00:39:23,511 --> 00:39:27,246
Iz. Iz?

567
00:39:27,348 --> 00:39:28,798
Izzie!

568
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,769
- Yang!
- It's George! It's George!

569
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,506
It's George! John Doe is George!

570
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,205
Izzie, look at me!
Open your eyes!

571
00:39:41,229 --> 00:39:42,796
Page Shepherd,
the chief, Bailey.

572
00:39:42,898 --> 00:39:45,448
We have you, you hear me?
We have you, we'll fix this.

573
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,601
- Just stay with us.
- - O'Malley, it's Shepherd.

574
00:39:48,703 --> 00:39:51,036
- You're not going anywhere.
- BP's dropping.

575
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,623
Put him out now!

576
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:55,625
- What happened?
- Is it her brain?

577
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,205
- Hyperkalemia.
- Couldn't control
the arrhythmias.

578
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,480
- Pressure's dropping.
- Intubation tray.

579
00:40:00,581 --> 00:40:04,818
- Alex, she signed a DNR.
- Shut up!

580
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,870
- She knew this might happen.
- I don't give a crap!

581
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:09,889
It's not what she wants.

582
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,708
Get a crash cart!

583
00:40:13,962 --> 00:40:17,463
- Karev, if she didn't...
- Look at her! Get a crash cart!

584
00:40:24,906 --> 00:40:29,008
- Screw the DNR! Hand me those paddles!
- Yang, take over compressions.

585
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,910
- I got it.
- One, two, three.

586
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,145
And down.

587
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,500
Charge to 300.
