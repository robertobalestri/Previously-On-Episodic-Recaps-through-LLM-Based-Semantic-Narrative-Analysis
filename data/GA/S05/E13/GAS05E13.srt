1
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,751
<i>I believe in heaven.</i>

2
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:29,061
<i>I also believe in hell.</i>

3
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,736
<i>I've never seen either,
but I believe they exist.</i>

4
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,048
<i>They have to exist.</i>

5
00:00:57,758 --> 00:01:00,125
<i>Because without a heaven...</i>

6
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,994
<i>without a hell...</i>

7
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:05,531
<i>we're all just headed for limbo.</i>

8
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:08,233
You coming?

9
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:10,347
If it's bad, the nurses
will come get us.

10
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:13,171
Dr. Grey, he's seizing!

11
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,256
How about now? Now can we go?

12
00:01:15,358 --> 00:01:19,161
Sadie, go find something
else to do. Now.

13
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,443
That's an order.

14
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,118
Why are you still here?

15
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:46,581
I'm here for you, Izzie Stevens.

16
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:47,856
No, you're not,

17
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:51,560
because I broke up with you.
So you are not here for me.

18
00:01:51,662 --> 00:01:53,829
I'm sorry, but...

19
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:57,131
you have to go.

20
00:01:57,234 --> 00:02:01,870
- I can't go. I'm here for...
- Me. Yeah. Right.

21
00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:04,889
- I am. I'm here for...
- Stop saying that!

22
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:25,060
Dr. Bailey, I just called UNOS.

23
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:27,963
Jackson's at the top of the
list for a liver and small bowel.

24
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,308
They can't come soon enough.

25
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:31,299
His ammonia
level's starting to rise.

26
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,486
I thought the shunt was
supposed to buy us 24 hours.

27
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:38,807
Isn't that what you said, that
it should give us 24 hours?

28
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,109
We're doing everything we can.

29
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:45,546
I know. I know you are.

30
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,819
Excuse me.

31
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,511
- Oh, my God - He had a seizure.

32
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:02,063
- I gave him lorazepam.
- You page Shepherd?

33
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,566
- I paged you.
- Page Shepherd.

34
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:07,319
- The patient doesn't want that.
- He tell you that?

35
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,722
Yes. Don't page him.

36
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:13,858
He's terribly unpleasant.

37
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,477
Mr. Dunn is a match

38
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:18,513
for your kid who
needs the transplant.

39
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,947
He's a match.

40
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:21,599
Uh-huh.

41
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,852
All of this wasn't
caused from the seizure,

42
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,154
but I'm sure you
know that already.

43
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:27,122
Oh, no.

44
00:03:27,224 --> 00:03:28,740
This is my project.

45
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:31,777
Dr. Grey does
not get the credit.

46
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,961
You probably have a brain bleed,

47
00:03:34,063 --> 00:03:36,075
which is why we need
to get Shepherd in here.

48
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:38,333
Dr. Bailey, he's
gonna die anyway.

49
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:44,122
The boy who needs organs,
I presume, wants to live.

50
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,625
And me?

51
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,160
I have organs...

52
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:53,114
and I'm ready to die.

53
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:00,772
- Dr. Sloan.
- Dr. Grey.

54
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:04,409
- After you, Dr. Grey.
- Thank you, Dr. Sloan.

55
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:12,183
It feels wrong on so many
levels I can't even count them.

56
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,353
But there is no case
in any medical book

57
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:16,321
that tells you how
to deal with this.

58
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,057
I don't need a book. I do
what's best for my patient.

59
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:20,904
I suggest you do the same.

60
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,829
- I am.
- Really? You page Shepherd yet?

61
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,764
Are you gonna page him?

62
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:32,787
I'm gonna do my best to
keep that beautiful boy alive

63
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:35,457
long enough to find
him some organs.

64
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:39,728
I suggest you do everything
you can to keep your patient alive.

65
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,648
Because we're doctors,
Grey. We're not... executioners.

66
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,094
- Don't even tell me.
- Locked.

67
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,379
People sleeping or...?

68
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:00,048
Why do I bother asking?

69
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,183
This is ridiculous.
I need sleep.

70
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:04,385
Oh, my God!

71
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:07,021
- That's not a good noise.
- That's a bad noise.

72
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:09,224
That's a really bad noise.

73
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,546
- Oh, my God! Are you OK?
- No!

74
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:17,432
It's bent. In the
middle. I think I broke it!

75
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:19,867
- Get Torres! Go!
- Um! Oh, OK.

76
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:53,563
I'm getting a 911 page

77
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:55,464
and I have a
casserole in the oven

78
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,100
I spent half the night baking...

79
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:59,207
- Hey.
- Whoa. I'm so sorry.

80
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:01,709
- Is Cristina a... a... around?
- No.

81
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:03,144
OK, then. OK, then.

82
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:05,847
Yep.

83
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,483
There's casserole in
the oven if you're hungry.

84
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:10,151
Thank you.

85
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:16,586
Has there been a change?

86
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,944
Has Matthew improved?

87
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,179
I'm sorry. Still
no brain activity.

88
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:26,784
- What are you doing to him?
- Blood test.

89
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,754
It's standard. Excuse us.

90
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:33,708
You two are on
Jackson all day today.

91
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,688
He doesn't have
a liver or intestines,

92
00:06:35,712 --> 00:06:38,312
toxins will build,
his brain will swell.

93
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:40,576
We can't stop it,
we can slow it down.

94
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,417
You don't have time for this,
to think about anyone else.

95
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,905
Stevens, I need a nod. A
yawn. Maybe even a little burp.

96
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,802
Something that lets me know

97
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,170
you're capable of
keeping this boy alive.

98
00:06:51,194 --> 00:06:53,845
Yes. Sorry. I'm all yours.

99
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,467
Way to listen. Thanks for that.

100
00:06:55,532 --> 00:06:58,683
Dr. Bailey, how much
time do we have left?

101
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,246
Sixteen hours, at the most.

102
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,348
There's a liver
dialysis machine.

103
00:07:02,372 --> 00:07:03,916
GI is using it
for a clinical trial.

104
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,707
- Liver dialysis?
- It's new. Completely
experimental.

105
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:08,588
It could help get
rid of the toxins.

106
00:07:08,612 --> 00:07:12,531
It may give Jackson a
few more hours... maybe.

107
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:15,082
All right, Stevens,
put in the ICP monitor.

108
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,129
Start tracking his
intracranial pressures.

109
00:07:17,153 --> 00:07:19,165
Karev, go get the machine.

110
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,157
What if it's hooked
up to somebody?

111
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:25,059
If that somebody has
more than 16 hours to live,

112
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:27,641
then we'll unhook them.

113
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:31,766
- I want off this case.
- Dr. Bailey?

114
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,335
Oh, God, I want off
this case. I want off...

115
00:07:34,438 --> 00:07:36,149
This little boy is gonna die.

116
00:07:36,173 --> 00:07:38,906
And I don't wanna be
there to see it. I just don't...

117
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:40,442
I can't see it... I want off.

118
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:42,643
I want off this
case. I want off.

119
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:46,175
When was the
last time you slept?

120
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,732
No, no, I'm OK.

121
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:50,079
You need one or
two hours of rest.

122
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,252
I'm good.

123
00:07:51,354 --> 00:07:53,972
I'm fine. Just go.

124
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,460
OK...

125
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:01,328
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

126
00:08:05,668 --> 00:08:07,569
Mmm.

127
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:10,705
- Mmm. You're very happy.
- I am happy.

128
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:13,275
I'm happy to see
you. You're not happy.

129
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:14,842
No, I've just been
here all night.

130
00:08:14,945 --> 00:08:18,730
How is our resident
psychopath? Is he gone yet?

131
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:19,832
Yeah, yeah, soon.

132
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,967
Good. Sooner he
gets out, the better.

133
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,602
Mm-hm.

134
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:29,574
By the way, Mom likes you.

135
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:33,194
She thinks you're good for me.

136
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:49,610
Oh! Dr. Torres!
Thank God you're here.

137
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:53,031
I'm headed to the
pit, got a 911 page.

138
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:56,067
It was me. I paged
you 911 for Dr. Sloan.

139
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,986
He's the emergency.
Himself. It's on his person.

140
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:02,424
- Mark's hurt?
- Yes. No. Yes. Badly injured.

141
00:09:02,526 --> 00:09:05,526
In a bad way, that is bad
for anyone who is a man,

142
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,728
but for Dr. Sloan in particular.

143
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,264
He may have broken a bone.

144
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,833
- A bone?
- He broke a bone.

145
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:16,020
I broke his bone.

146
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:20,374
You're kidding, right?

147
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:23,525
You're not kidding.

148
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,261
Cristina, I wanted to
apologize for last night.

149
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:43,298
It was not my intention
to arrive in that state.

150
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,880
You don't have to say anything.

151
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:48,052
As a rule, if I'm
showering with a woman

152
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,554
I do it without my clothes.

153
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:53,024
And if I get in her bed naked,
I don't pass out, and if I...

154
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,376
It's OK.

155
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:58,496
- It's not.
- It's not.

156
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:02,634
But you don't
have to talk about it.

157
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:12,827
It's getting a little
harder to breathe.

158
00:10:14,798 --> 00:10:16,731
You can stop
doing this, William.

159
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,499
You can stop at any time.

160
00:10:19,903 --> 00:10:21,183
I know.

161
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,521
I know.

162
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,774
Do you want me to
page Dr. Shepherd?

163
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,427
He's your boyfriend, isn't he?

164
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:36,016
Yes. I had a feeling.

165
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,986
Yes.

166
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:41,222
I had a feeling.

167
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:45,176
The man has very good taste.

168
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:50,481
Right now all I think
about are lemons.

169
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,324
Lemons?

170
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:05,396
When my grandfather was
dying, he said he smelled lemons.

171
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:11,069
It's all he could talk about for
three days, the smell of lemons.

172
00:11:13,523 --> 00:11:16,825
I keep waiting to
smell them, and I don't.

173
00:11:19,295 --> 00:11:23,998
Of course, he
was a big liar, so...

174
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,569
Are you sure you don't want
me to page Dr. Shepherd?

175
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:31,422
I'm sure.

176
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:34,742
OK.

177
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:48,106
O'Malley, whatever you're
doing, I need you to drop it.

178
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,541
- I was going home.
- Not anymore.

179
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,812
I need you to
talk to the nurses.

180
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,480
Find out if any
patients on life support

181
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,583
are O positive or brain dead.

182
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:01,318
Then cross-match those
folks against Jackson Prescott.

183
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,937
- Kid's running out of time.
- OK.

184
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,023
And O'Malley...

185
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,025
Be sensitive to their families.

186
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:10,828
We need organs for this
boy, but we can only ask.

187
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,914
We can't pressure. We
can't coerce. Understood?

188
00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:15,316
Of course, sir.

189
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:20,638
- Um, Cristina?
- Oh, Shepherd.

190
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,264
- It's a ring.
- It's from my mother.

191
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:32,394
It's from me. It
was my mother's,

192
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,812
I'm gonna give it
to Meredith soon.

193
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,955
I'm looking for an opinion
on whether she's gonna like it,

194
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:39,757
or I should have the
setting redone more modern.

195
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,358
That's really not my job.

196
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,821
I know you two
are still fighting.

197
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,024
Isn't it about time
you wrap that up?

198
00:12:45,048 --> 00:12:47,476
I ask, because when I propose,

199
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,251
she's gonna need
somebody to freak out to.

200
00:12:51,588 --> 00:12:53,120
She misses you.

201
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,039
A lot.

202
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:58,726
You must miss her. I don't
know what's going on in your life,

203
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,111
but you must have something

204
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,908
you need to freak
out to her about.

205
00:13:01,932 --> 00:13:04,682
I'm sorry. You should
ask someone else.

206
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,457
Ms. Prescott? Have you
had anything to eat today?

207
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,987
You should keep
your strength up.

208
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:17,212
Get a cup of
coffee or some food.

209
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:19,980
I'll stay here with Jackson.
He's stable for now.

210
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:24,168
Go on. I'll stay.

211
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:34,379
You are like the guy who
graduated from high school

212
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,864
and still hangs out
on the football field.

213
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:39,951
- Do you believe in heaven?
- What?

214
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,903
Heaven.

215
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,090
I don't know. I guess.

216
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,762
Because I thought that,
maybe, this was heaven.

217
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:52,708
Getting to be here with you.

218
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:58,603
But now... Now I'm
not so sure. I think this...

219
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,615
I think this may be hell, or...

220
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,240
What are you talking about?

221
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,325
- I'm here for you.
- For me, I know.

222
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:08,162
I got it, I hear you...
a thousand times.

223
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:12,783
I chose Alex. I'm sorry. I am.
I'm really sorry about that...

224
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,251
And I'm still here.

225
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,154
You broke up with
me and I'm still here.

226
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,801
Doesn't that tell you anything?

227
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:20,574
It tells me that you're jealous.

228
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:22,727
That you don't want
me to be happy,

229
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:24,106
you don't want me
to choose Alex...

230
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,398
Damn it, listen!
You can't pick Alex.

231
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,200
- I'm here for you!
- Denny...

232
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,854
I want you to be happy, Izzie.

233
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,914
I do. And I would
leave, if I could.

234
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,593
You think I want to stay here

235
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,535
while you tell me you
want another man?

236
00:14:50,073 --> 00:14:53,691
I can't go because
you won't listen to me.

237
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:58,162
- I am here for you.
- What does that even mean?

238
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:02,483
- What does it mean?
- You're a doctor, Izzie.

239
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,336
Figure it out.

240
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:10,658
Thank you.

241
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:14,312
What?

242
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,998
Did... What?

243
00:15:19,402 --> 00:15:20,718
Nothing.

244
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:26,890
How's your serial killer? Did
you monitor him last night?

245
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,877
Yeah. I got it covered.

246
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:39,119
Cristina, I said
I've got it covered.

247
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,301
Tell me you paged Shepherd.

248
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:56,136
- He wants to die.
- Meredith!

249
00:15:56,238 --> 00:15:59,173
He's gonna die anyway, in
a few days. If he dies here,

250
00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:01,875
we can donate organs to
the ten-year-old down the hall.

251
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:03,393
Derek won't allow it.

252
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,264
I didn't page him. I
hope you won't, either.

253
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,349
I know you think this is
wrong. Just let me do this.

254
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,656
Please... please help.

255
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:18,492
Help me.

256
00:16:18,595 --> 00:16:20,894
I don't want to die.

257
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:24,682
- I don't want to die.
- Page Shepherd right now!

258
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:28,970
<i>Code blue, 3rd floor.
Code blue, 3rd floor.</i>

259
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:37,327
- Should I thread the catheter?
- I want to see
the Grand Canyon.

260
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:40,247
- Visualize it on the ultrasound.
- - I wanna hike it.

261
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:42,149
Look out over Dead Man's Drop.

262
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,584
Not because I'm
dead. Just 'cause,

263
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:45,720
- you know, the view.
- Shut up.

264
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:48,723
- What was that?
- Nothing.

265
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:51,342
- Should I be able
to see the needle?
- Yeah.

266
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,961
That shadow within
the lumen is the catheter.

267
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:58,532
Have we heard anything from
UNOS? Have we heard anything?

268
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,201
I'll call them back.

269
00:17:01,304 --> 00:17:03,416
I'd also like to see the
Great Wall of China.

270
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,766
I did a lot of
traveling in my life

271
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,641
but never made it
to Asia. I regret that.

272
00:17:07,743 --> 00:17:10,344
My point, you unbelievably
stubborn woman,

273
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:15,132
is that there are other things
I would like to do and see.

274
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:18,035
Things that I would
like to, but I can't.

275
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:21,054
I can't go to heaven
or hell or to Asia.

276
00:17:21,157 --> 00:17:24,992
I can't do anything but
this until you figure it out.

277
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:26,831
Would you just tell me already?!

278
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,884
I'm sorry.

279
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:38,839
Why don't you take a
little break, Dr. Stevens.

280
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,357
Does your sister talk to you
anymore or just boss you around?

281
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:58,037
She used to talk to me.

282
00:17:58,061 --> 00:18:00,311
Now she tells me to get
lost, like we aren't friends.

283
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:02,824
- You hear Sloan
broke his goods?
- What?

284
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,866
- On-call room. I heard him scream.
- With Torres?

285
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:09,220
Maybe. Whoever it was,
whoever rode him and broke him?

286
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,655
That's a girl I want on me.

287
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,707
Was it Torres?

288
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:15,459
- What?
- Those two are off and on.

289
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,422
Think she's the
one who broke it?

290
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:19,597
How should I know?
It's not my business.

291
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,898
It's nobody's business.
It's definitely not yours...

292
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,884
Not that I know.

293
00:18:23,986 --> 00:18:27,037
If I did know who broke
Mark's penis, I wouldn't tell you.

294
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,222
We're not friends.

295
00:18:28,324 --> 00:18:30,458
I took out your appendix,
almost ended my career.

296
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,593
That doesn't make us close.

297
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:38,746
I want him prepped and
in the OR in 20 minutes.

298
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:40,167
Yes, sir.

299
00:18:42,772 --> 00:18:44,538
Should have paged
me a long time ago.

300
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,708
Better yet, when I asked how
he was, you should have told me.

301
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,088
I was following the
patient's wishes.

302
00:18:50,112 --> 00:18:51,429
He doesn't get wishes.

303
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,831
- He killed five women.
- You believe you're right,

304
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,444
I think I'm right.
If I said something

305
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,046
there'd have been a debate.

306
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,371
He's been manipulating you since
he got here. He preys on women.

307
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,518
I made a decision as his doctor.

308
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:03,390
A bad decision.

309
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:05,709
It was the wrong decision.

310
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,545
You're gonna scrub
in on his surgery

311
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,914
and watch while I try like
hell to undo what you did.

312
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,323
- His ICP's not going under 25.
- Is the catheter occluded?

313
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:20,669
- Looks fine.
- All right.

314
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,371
Try adjusting the height
of the drip chamber.

315
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,295
Raise his bed 10 degrees.

316
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,963
- What'll that do?
- Not much.

317
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:30,301
Jackson. Jackson,
listen to Mommy.

318
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:34,371
It's not time. You
do not get to go yet.

319
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,485
You have to stay here with me.

320
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,487
You hear me? You
stay with Mommy.

321
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,722
It is not time,
baby. I love you.

322
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:44,715
And I need you to fight. I
need you to fight, Jackson.

323
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:49,520
Come on, come on.
You fight to stay alive.

324
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,858
Yeah, that's a penile fracture.

325
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,188
Oh, I'm gonna kill myself.

326
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,092
We should operate,
then kill yourself.

327
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,396
Oh, God!

328
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:19,433
- Can you do it?
- Him? No! He's a meatballer.

329
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:22,002
He is meticulous and he
will keep his mouth shut.

330
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:25,238
Mainly because I've seen you
naked in a resident's bedroom.

331
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:27,607
I've done this before.
It's not complicated.

332
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,743
Guys run into this
on the battlefield?

333
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:32,023
Don't think we should talk
about how guys run into this.

334
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:33,380
Line up an OR.

335
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,183
We need to get in fast or
you risk permanent damage.

336
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:38,652
Oh, God! No permanent
damage, please.

337
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:45,892
- Hey...
- Little Grey, go away.

338
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,695
I don't want you
to see me like this.

339
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:49,140
I made you like this.

340
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,964
I'm saying "please," here.

341
00:20:53,403 --> 00:20:55,536
Please.

342
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:01,291
Uh...

343
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:08,048
Talk to me, O'Malley.

344
00:21:09,952 --> 00:21:11,952
- My God.
- The guy's not a donor.

345
00:21:12,054 --> 00:21:14,414
They're about to unplug him.

346
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:36,777
- Dr. Shepherd!
- Dr. Bailey?

347
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:39,946
I need you to stop.

348
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,916
I need you to put
down the scalpel.

349
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,068
This man is trying
to kill himself.

350
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,937
God forgive me, I
need you to let him.

351
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,420
You need to leave
my OR, Dr. Bailey.

352
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:07,391
In five days... In five days
this man is going to die,

353
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,877
and his organs are
gonna go with him.

354
00:22:09,979 --> 00:22:14,198
They'll be buried with his body,
and they'll rot in the ground,

355
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,168
and that is a crime.

356
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,870
It's a crime against life.

357
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:23,006
It's only five days. That's it.

358
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,975
That's all we're
taking from him,

359
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,160
and he doesn't want them anyway.

360
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:34,418
- We took an oath, Miranda.
- I know... that.

361
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,688
I know we took an oath, but...

362
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:41,375
right now, that oath
makes no sense.

363
00:22:41,477 --> 00:22:44,544
It makes no sense. It doesn't.

364
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:48,699
Just stop. Don't do
anything else for this man.

365
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:53,854
If I stop this surgery,

366
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:57,424
it's the same as me sticking
this scalpel into his brain.

367
00:22:59,528 --> 00:23:01,695
Is that what you want?

368
00:23:03,598 --> 00:23:06,133
Yes. That's what I want.

369
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:19,162
- I'm sorry, what do you want?
- I'm sorry.

370
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:21,948
I know this is excruciating.

371
00:23:22,051 --> 00:23:23,700
But what I want...

372
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,102
what I need...

373
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:31,241
are your husband's organs.
His liver and his bowels.

374
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:34,244
- He's a match for...
- Go away.

375
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,380
- I'm sorry?
- Please, go away.

376
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:39,766
I don't want anyone
cutting into him anymore.

377
00:23:40,436 --> 00:23:41,902
I can't.

378
00:23:43,206 --> 00:23:45,139
I can't take any more.

379
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:47,424
He was healthy.

380
00:23:48,577 --> 00:23:50,528
He was healthy two days ago.

381
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,479
He's my love.

382
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:56,033
And he put his head
through a windshield.

383
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:59,719
And I have to unplug him.

384
00:23:59,821 --> 00:24:01,016
He is the person who is supposed

385
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,457
to hold my hand
when things go bad.

386
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:05,792
He is supposed
to be here to help.

387
00:24:07,263 --> 00:24:09,647
But he gets to go to heaven.

388
00:24:10,733 --> 00:24:13,350
I can't take any more.

389
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,530
I can barely do this.

390
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,788
So, please, go away.

391
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,758
I don't want anyone
cutting into him.

392
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,211
Thanks for doing this, by the
way. I know you didn't have to.

393
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:45,732
Apparently I did, or you would
blackmail me to keep me quiet.

394
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:47,801
I wasn't gonna
actually do anything.

395
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:50,344
I wasn't gonna say anything.

396
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:56,276
Uh, it wasn't me, by
the way. With Mark.

397
00:24:56,378 --> 00:24:59,113
- In case you were wondering.
- Wondering what?

398
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:00,447
Who broke him.

399
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:04,368
We're just friends.
I mean, we also...

400
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,871
We don't really,
actually, anymore.

401
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:08,583
He got involved
with somebody else

402
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,424
plus I'm a lesbian now, maybe.

403
00:25:10,526 --> 00:25:13,076
Sort of. I don't know.

404
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,679
Anyway, he took up
with somebody else.

405
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:17,831
That's cool,
'cause I'm celibate.

406
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,434
I cook now, which
is totally great.

407
00:25:20,536 --> 00:25:23,103
I roasted a chicken.
I'm happy for him,

408
00:25:23,205 --> 00:25:27,023
that he's got somebody who can,
you know, shake and break him.

409
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:30,360
I guess I'd be lying if I said

410
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,863
I didn't miss having
a backup penis,

411
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:34,932
just in case I'm not a lesbian.

412
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,784
And he was my friend,
too. I guess he still is,

413
00:25:37,886 --> 00:25:39,166
but it's never the same

414
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,138
when somebody's getting
all into somebody new,

415
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,341
so it's kind of like I've
lost both those things,

416
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:47,764
the penis and the friend.

417
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:53,600
I hate to lose one good
thing, never mind two.

418
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,426
Sometimes I get started talking

419
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:05,128
and I... say more than I should.

420
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,297
Picked up on that.

421
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,788
Cristina can seem cold, but...

422
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,957
that's just a lid,

423
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:20,577
a lid on a jar that
holds her feelings.

424
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,897
But... it's a big jar.

425
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,834
So don't give up too easy.

426
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:30,904
Torres, I hope you
find your backup penis

427
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,506
or a great lesbian to cook for.

428
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:37,528
- Whichever.
- Thank you.

429
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,466
How's he doing?

430
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,140
Intercranial pressure's
through the roof.

431
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:51,992
Where the hell have you been?

432
00:26:52,928 --> 00:26:56,079
I... had some stuff.

433
00:26:57,433 --> 00:26:59,817
Dead man talking stuff?

434
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,386
Yeah, I... I don't know.

435
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:05,522
This kid is dying
in front of his mom.

436
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,758
It's so bad
Dr. Bailey, Dr. Bailey

437
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:10,927
can't stay in here and watch.

438
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,679
But we're busting
our asses to save him,

439
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:15,148
and you're talking
to a dead guy.

440
00:27:15,251 --> 00:27:16,661
You want to do that
crap at home, fine.

441
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:19,035
But not here. Here
you're a doctor.

442
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,121
Start acting like one.

443
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,076
ICP's too high.

444
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:27,711
I just gave him
hypertonic saline.

445
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:28,857
When was his last lorazepam?

446
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:30,347
Gave him a bolus 20 minutes ago.

447
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:33,800
Put him on a drip with Vec.
And put him on a BIS monitor.

448
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,586
Check with UNOS again.

449
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:37,721
I know it's a long
shot. Just go.

450
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,607
Uh-huh.

451
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:41,992
Whatever Bailey's doing,

452
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:44,577
I hope she's having
better luck than we are.

453
00:27:46,648 --> 00:27:48,859
He's hemorrhaging
through his craniectomy.

454
00:27:48,883 --> 00:27:51,403
Should I put in a drain?

455
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,227
That's up to Dr. Bailey.

456
00:27:53,322 --> 00:27:55,872
Dr. Bailey?

457
00:27:57,192 --> 00:28:00,927
- Dr. Bailey? Should
I put in a drain?
- No.

458
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:03,091
There's a lot of bleeding...

459
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:06,183
- I'm aware of that, Dr. Yang.
- Sir, really soon.

460
00:28:13,509 --> 00:28:15,409
It's your call, Dr. Bailey.

461
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:17,460
It's up to you.

462
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:21,264
Am I an executioner
or am I a surgeon?

463
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:26,669
It's up to you. It's your call.

464
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:45,205
Pick up the scalpel.

465
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,863
He can't take his
liver to heaven,

466
00:29:10,965 --> 00:29:13,483
can't take his
bowels or kidneys.

467
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,453
His brain is gone, but those
organs are probably good

468
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,438
because he's a young man.

469
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:21,475
And I know this is not
what you want to think about.

470
00:29:21,577 --> 00:29:24,828
It's more than anyone should
ever have to think about.

471
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:28,665
But he can't take
his organs with him.

472
00:29:31,786 --> 00:29:34,165
I heard it was this
physical therapist

473
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,724
from the rehab floor who
does this fancy yoga thing,

474
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:41,261
where she turns herself into a
pretzel while she's on top of a guy.

475
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:44,130
- She quit two weeks ago.
- I thought it was Torres.

476
00:29:44,232 --> 00:29:47,267
Whoever it was is going
down in Seattle Grace history.

477
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,202
Sloan is a legend.

478
00:29:49,304 --> 00:29:53,339
Can you imagine the kind of muscle
it takes to break a man like that?

479
00:29:53,442 --> 00:29:56,760
Shut up! Just shut up about it!

480
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,780
You know something.

481
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:03,350
I know that it's
nobody's business.

482
00:30:03,452 --> 00:30:04,851
She knows something.

483
00:30:04,953 --> 00:30:06,581
Did you see somebody
come out of the room?

484
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:08,121
Maybe it was her.

485
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,857
What?

486
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:13,510
It was me. OK? Can we drop it?

487
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:16,246
It was me.

488
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:20,367
I do this twist and shout thing
that blows most guys' minds,

489
00:30:20,469 --> 00:30:21,879
and I guess I
twisted a little too far,

490
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,938
and almost took the
whole thing off. OK?

491
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,628
I can feel you.

492
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,564
I can smell you.

493
00:30:50,665 --> 00:30:53,166
If you're dead, how come
I can smell your skin?

494
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:57,437
So I'm thinking,
maybe, you're not dead.

495
00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:00,674
Maybe that was the
part of me that was crazy.

496
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,994
Maybe this is the not
crazy part. You're still alive.

497
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:05,796
Right? That's it?

498
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:09,332
I'm sorry. No.

499
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:13,520
Then how come I
can feel your heart?

500
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,507
Because I'm real... to you.

501
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:23,447
Are you a ghost
or a dream or...?

502
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:26,616
You're a doctor,
Izzie, a scientist.

503
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,469
- Think like a scientist.
- I am.

504
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:31,371
I am!

505
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:34,774
Scientists believe
what they can see.

506
00:31:34,876 --> 00:31:37,494
What they can feel. Facts.

507
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,463
Hard facts.

508
00:31:41,182 --> 00:31:43,616
I slapped you. That is a fact.

509
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:48,639
I felt your face
on my hand. Fact.

510
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:52,141
We made love. That's a fact.

511
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,696
I can feel your breath
against my skin. Fact.

512
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,414
Fact. Fact.

513
00:32:00,853 --> 00:32:03,353
Izzie. Izzie, Izzie.

514
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:05,622
What's happening?

515
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,825
You tell me.

516
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,645
I'm scared.

517
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:32,548
ICP's still going up.

518
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,535
- Are you
hyperventilating him enough?
- Yes.

519
00:32:35,637 --> 00:32:37,749
Raise him all the way up.

520
00:32:37,773 --> 00:32:41,107
Jackson, you have
to hold on. OK, baby?

521
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,344
Melinda, step back. You're in
the way. You need to step back.

522
00:32:44,446 --> 00:32:48,615
Hold on for Mommy, OK?
Please, Jackson. Please!

523
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,300
Ms. Prescott.

524
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:53,603
- No. No, no, no, no, no, no!
- You have to let
them work on him.

525
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:57,841
I can't leave my son. I can't.
I can't leave him. Please.

526
00:32:57,943 --> 00:33:01,478
- Let me stay, please!
- We'll be outside.

527
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,681
- You see any bleeders?
- Field looks clear.

528
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:07,751
Nice work, Dr. Yang.
Go ahead and close up.

529
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:10,703
- Thank you, sir.
- What a waste.

530
00:33:11,673 --> 00:33:14,775
He's alive, Dr. Grey.
We saved a life.

531
00:33:14,877 --> 00:33:16,342
That's never a waste.

532
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,815
He's just a little boy.

533
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,550
He's never had a sleepover.

534
00:33:23,652 --> 00:33:25,652
He's never learned
to ride a bike.

535
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,604
Melinda, listen to me.

536
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:32,092
Miracles happen. Medical
miracles happen every day.

Even when they shouldn't.

539
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,815
I need to be with him. He's
never been anywhere without me.

540
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:42,869
He can't go alone. I
need to be with him.

541
00:33:42,971 --> 00:33:44,304
You are here with him.

542
00:33:44,406 --> 00:33:47,340
You're here for him even
though you aren't in the room.

543
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,943
You are. You are here for him.

A good friend. And since no
one is going to be coming in,

651

I am now going to climb into
bed with you and stroke your hair.

652
