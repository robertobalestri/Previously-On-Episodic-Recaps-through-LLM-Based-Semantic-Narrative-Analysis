00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,964
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:03,988 --> 00:00:05,781
<i>You got some problems.
You got some big problems.</i>

3
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,133
<i>I kissed a peds surgeon.</i>

4
00:00:07,157 --> 00:00:09,341
Calliope, this is
Julie. My date.

5
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:11,109
I'm seeing Lexie.

6
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:17,866
- Oh, my god,
I think I broke it!
- This is Patient X.

7
00:00:17,968 --> 00:00:21,636
She's a 29-year-old female
we misdiagnosed with anemia.

8
00:00:21,738 --> 00:00:24,690
I'm applying for a
fellowship in Pediatric Sur...

9
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:26,174
Which is not what
we had discussed!

10
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,359
Where's my wife? You killed her!

11
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:30,029
You're a murderer.

12
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:35,417
<i>Every surgeon I
know has a shadow.</i>

13
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,720
<i>A dark cloud of fear and doubt</i>

14
00:00:38,822 --> 00:00:41,790
<i>that follows even the
best of us into the OR.</i>

15
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:44,359
- Dude, he is fried.
- He is not fried.

16
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:48,413
He lost a patient and got a lawsuit
all in one week, he just needs time.

17
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:51,833
He's been there for three days.
The cushions are bonding to his ass.

18
00:00:51,935 --> 00:00:55,220
- And he's eating all my cereal.
- He's taking stock.

19
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:59,441
Something huge and
life-altering happened to him,

20
00:00:59,543 --> 00:01:03,027
and he's taking stock,
figuring out his next move.

21
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,770
We shouldn't judge and rush him.

22
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:07,382
Whatever. Sylvia Plath's
picking out the marshmallows.

23
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,484
They're the best part.

24
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:11,498
I'm pretty sure he's
sitting on my keys.

25
00:01:11,522 --> 00:01:15,240
I'd ask him to move,
but he looks so... comfy.

26
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,625
You guys are cowards.

27
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,096
Hey.

28
00:01:21,198 --> 00:01:24,149
You're eating, that's
good. Appetite is good.

29
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:28,003
You know what else is good?
Showering. Cleansing. Water.

30
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:30,955
Are you thinking you'll
shower, go in to the hospital?

31
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:32,618
I have to for the deposition.

32
00:01:32,642 --> 00:01:34,409
I have to go explain in detail

33
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,511
how I killed a
man's pregnant wife.

34
00:01:36,613 --> 00:01:39,414
That's good. Not
the killing part,

35
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,956
but the... I think you'll
feel better once you...

36
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:46,404
go to... work.

37
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,929
He'll be fine.

38
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,042
<i>We pretend the
shadow isn't there.</i>

39
00:01:57,801 --> 00:02:00,435
<i>Hoping that if we
save more lives,</i>

40
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,887
<i>master harder techniques,</i>

41
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,223
<i>run faster and farther,</i>

42
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:07,809
<i>it'll get tired and
give up the chase.</i>

43
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:09,978
<i>But like they say...</i>

44
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:13,782
<i>You can't outrun your shadow.</i>

45
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:17,052
Hey.

46
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:23,825
Morning.

47
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:34,919
I dreamt once I was falling out a
window, hanging on to the drapes.

48
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:37,172
I woke up pulling
Meredith's hair.

49
00:02:38,174 --> 00:02:39,975
Ha.

50
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:43,411
So we have a trauma coming,
a trampling on a football field.

51
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:45,831
- I don't need your help.
- I'm on your service today.

52
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:49,100
I'm telling you, Dr. Yang,
to take care of that elbow.

53
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:51,619
There you are. What
happened to you?

54
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:54,957
- I tripped and fell. It's fine.
- No, no, it's not.

55
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,044
It's... It's nothing.

56
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:01,580
It was an accident.
What's wrong with you?

57
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,626
Derek won't get off the couch.

58
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,251
So the weaker sex.

59
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,322
It's still swollen. I'd
give it another day rest.

60
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:13,225
- I haven't operated in days.
- Don't hit with
your scalpel hand.

61
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,777
- Have you talked to him?
- He threw the first punch.

62
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:19,180
- You did catch him
at a bad time.
- So he lost a patient. Boo-hoo.

63
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,583
We're surgeons, we're
men, we lose patients.

64
00:03:21,685 --> 00:03:24,764
Doesn't give him the right to go
around behaving like a drunk frat boy.

65
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:29,074
Now I'm supposed to go crawling
back, begging for his forgiveness?

66
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:32,143
- What... What are you doing?
- Shh, shh, shh.

67
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:37,982
I went<i> Say Anything</i> on the ped
surgeon in front of the ped surgeon's date,

68
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:41,803
- so I am hiding
from the ped surgeon.
- Mature.

69
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:44,422
You got in a fist
fight. No judging.

70
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:47,486
- Hi.
- Hand!

71
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,379
Hand! Oh, God,
I'm sorry. I forgot.

72
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,347
I am so sorry, I feel terrible,

73
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:55,984
about everything, about the fight,
and your hand, and Derek and...

74
00:03:56,086 --> 00:03:58,687
He's not doing so well, I
think you should talk to him.

75
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:01,022
- I should talk to him?!
- Mm-hmm.

76
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:08,246
Look at you, with your stethoscope
around your neck, charting...

77
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,332
I can totally see
you in ten years,

78
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:13,218
little salt and pepper in
your hair, big shot attending...

79
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,253
You're gonna be
a rockstar, Alex.

80
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,456
- What is this?
- What?

81
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:22,093
I can't fantasize about my
boyfriend and his bright, bright future?

82
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:25,480
- Shut up.
- Dr. Stevens?

83
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:28,478
We've been working on the Patient
X case and we have a couple of ideas.

84
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,085
Great. Let's get to work.

85
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:35,474
What's this Patient X
that's taking the interns?

86
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:38,343
When's it gonna be over? I
need minions to do my crap work.

87
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,777
Some new teaching thing.

88
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,630
We're killing
ourselves to get OR.

89
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:43,812
When is the last time
Izzie held a scalpel?

90
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,501
She's falling behind.
She's like the new O'Malley.

91
00:04:46,603 --> 00:04:48,698
- Izzie's nothing
like O'Malley.
- Hello...

92
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:52,073
OK, O'Malley,
you're in the clinic,

93
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:54,921
Grey and Yang, with me.
Karev, you're in the pit with Hunt.

94
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:56,728
Dr. Bailey, I'm on trauma today.

95
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,175
Save it, Yang. Hunt wants Karev.

96
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,682
Oh! Sir, there you are.

97
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,451
Shepherd planning to
grace us with his presence?

98
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,420
Yes, he's fine.

99
00:05:07,124 --> 00:05:09,591
Sir! I've been trying to
page you all morning.

100
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:13,411
- I could use help on a case.
- No peds today?

101
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:14,596
Uh, no.

102
00:05:14,698 --> 00:05:18,933
- Must be slumming.
- Excuse me? Sir...

103
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,403
Tricia Shelley, 31,

104
00:05:21,505 --> 00:05:24,439
Megan Shelley, 27,
Michael Shelley, 23.

105
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:28,343
Genetic testing revealed
they all carry the CDH1 gene

106
00:05:28,445 --> 00:05:30,561
for hereditary
diffuse gastric cancer.

107
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,197
Which means what, Dr. Grey?

108
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:34,977
Which means they all have a 3-in-4
chance of developing the cancer.

109
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,336
Dr. Bailey's taken tumors out of
everyone on our mother's side.

110
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:42,073
Unfortunately, it's a highly aggressive
cancer, the tumors grow quickly,

111
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,677
- by the time I get in...
- Our family's tree's
down to a branch.

112
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:49,164
How is... Uncle Bud doing?

113
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,465
Dead.

114
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:53,552
- And Aunt Helen?
- Dead.

115
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:56,014
- What about
the Minnesota cousin?
- Not dead!

116
00:05:56,106 --> 00:06:00,108
- She's 90 pounds
and in hospice, Meg.
- Still. Not dead yet.

117
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,345
So, uh, you've decided you're
ready to take the next step.

118
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,131
We've made a pact,
we're all in this together.

119
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,018
Cut our stomachs
out, Dr. Bailey.

120
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,144
Beth Dearborn, 17-year-old
with a history of seizures,

121
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:22,980
had a grand mal during band
performance, started seizing on arrival.

122
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,833
Push two of lorazepam.

123
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:27,118
She's in v-fib! Charge
the paddles to 200.

124
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,556
The v-fib could be from the seizure.
If she's not in v-fib, she'll flatline.

125
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:34,492
- You got a pulse?
- I don't think so. It's hard to tell.

126
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,795
- Lorazepam's not working.
- What do we do?

127
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:40,131
We shock her and save
her or shock her and kill her.

128
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,887
What the hell. Clear!

129
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,395
Clear!

130
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,190
- Sinus tach.
- Good call, Dr. Hunt.

131
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,975
The odds are 50-50 shot.

132
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,814
Oh, no... it happened again?

133
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,833
I'm Dr. Robbins, the pediatric
surgeon on call, this is Dr. Hunt.

134
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:19,754
You got beat up while marching,
I'm going to check for internal injuries.

135
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:22,990
I seized during the
performance? But I took my meds...

136
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:25,159
Relax, it's not like you
crapped your pants.

137
00:07:25,262 --> 00:07:29,164
It is like I crapped my pants. I had
a seizure in front of the entire band.

138
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:33,818
It is exactly like I crapped my
pants. They're going to kill me.

139
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,187
- Who?
- Seizure patrol.

140
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:43,294
- You're the seizure patrol?
- I'm first clarinet,
he's drum major.

141
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,046
Whenever Beth has a seizure,

142
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:49,100
we drop our instruments, roll her on her
side so she doesn't choke on her tongue.

143
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:52,465
We were in the Northwest Regional
Parade. We were favored to win.

144
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:55,423
Yeah, until Beth took down
the snare drum, woodwinds...

145
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:58,242
the tubas tried to avoid
her but she was in formation.

146
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,879
Yeah. Why don't you
go call her parents?

147
00:08:02,865 --> 00:08:06,234
I'm gonna run some tests, but
she's coded once, so watch her,

148
00:08:06,336 --> 00:08:09,521
- standby with a crash cart.
- You want me to baby-sit?

149
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:12,807
- That's an intern job.
- I don't see
any interns around.

150
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:17,162
Dr. Grey?

151
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:20,565
Patient X, a previously
healthy 29-year-old female

152
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,801
presented with stable vital
signs, a normal physical exam,

153
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:28,356
with symptoms of right upper quadrant
pain, nausea, and hallucinations.

154
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,108
Head CT, chest X-ray,
CBC were normal,

155
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,378
but chemistries revealed
an elevated LDH.

156
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:38,416
You are this girl's doctor, she comes to
you, scared, doesn't know what's wrong,

157
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,152
you have to diagnose
her. What do you do next?

158
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,950
- What test do you run?
- A retic count
or peripheral smear?

159
00:08:43,974 --> 00:08:46,774
You'd be wasting your time.
The CBC was normal, remember?

160
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:49,794
You said there was abdominal
pain, what about an upper GI?

161
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,162
Good.

162
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,999
That is exactly what
Patient X's doctor did next.

163
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,235
What does this tell us?

164
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:02,857
- What is this?
- Side effects
and complications

165
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,828
from prophylactic gastrectomy, so
post-op you know what to expect.

166
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,281
Malnourishment, weakness,
fatigue... dumping syndrome?

167
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,268
- That doesn't sound good.
- Possible anal leakage?!

168
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,254
A gastrectomy isn't like
getting your appendix out.

169
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:20,342
We're changing the way your digestive
system works, a serious adjustment.

170
00:09:20,444 --> 00:09:23,528
I'm president of my frat, have
a girlfriend, go snowboarding!

171
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,331
How am I supposed to do that when
I'm a weak old man with anal leakage!?

172
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,393
You know how
important this is to Trish.

173
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,603
Trish has run our lives
since we were kids,

174
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:35,306
she decides where we go to dinner,
vacation, where we do Thanksgiving...

175
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,476
I'm 23. If I don't want to butcher
myself, she can't make me.

176
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:42,680
So you'd rather die like Mom?
Or Grandpa? Or Uncle Bud?

177
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,417
It's not quick, Mike. It's
a slow, painful way to go.

178
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,136
There's a 1-in-4 shot
we don't get it, right?

179
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,200
- That's something!
- Don't be stupid.

180
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:52,751
You are doing
this, we discussed...

181
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:56,077
You're not in charge
of me anymore!

182
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,598
Meg?

183
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,302
I didn't realize it
was such a big deal.

184
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:09,090
I just... I need a little
time to think about it, OK?

185
00:10:12,396 --> 00:10:16,531
No, Callahan on the
bypass, Levin on the appy.

186
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:19,267
Damn craniotomy. Where
the hell is Shepherd?!

187
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,087
You can't rely on Shepherd.
Is there anything I can do?

188
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:26,274
My neurosurgeon has been missing
for days, I have no head of cardio,

189
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,843
general surgeons quitting
on me left and right,

190
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:31,545
surgeries piling up like
dead fish and no surgeons!

191
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:33,330
Now would be a
bad time to tell you

192
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:37,268
my hand's still out of
commission and I can't operate.

193
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:41,422
Leave me on the board,
chief. I won't let you down.

194
00:10:41,524 --> 00:10:43,324
I could do that craniotomy.

195
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:48,896
Um...

196
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:51,349
Put Dr. Nelson
on the craniotomy.

197
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:56,437
- Appreciate it, John.
- It... It's Jim.

198
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:58,940
You must be new.
Welcome to Seattle Grace.

199
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:00,958
I've been here ten years.

200
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,928
I was interim chief of neuro
before Shepherd in his red cape

201
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,646
swooped in from New York.

202
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:10,368
- Mark Sloan, plastics.
- We've met. Three times.

203
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:18,426
I don't know why Mr. Bimm
ever let her join band.

204
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:21,595
- Not like she's
a master flautist...
- OK, get out!

205
00:11:21,697 --> 00:11:23,978
Mr. Bimm said
to stay until her...

206
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:26,217
I got it! I'm
seizure patrol now.

207
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:33,107
- Your friends are asses.
- They're not my friends.

208
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:36,211
Once you spazz out in school,
friends are hard to come by.

209
00:11:36,313 --> 00:11:40,164
You can't help the epilepsy, but
nobody made you join the marching band.

210
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,967
- It's spreading nerd on nerd.
- I like being in the band.

211
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:46,432
It's the one thing I'm good at.
What'd you do in high school?

212
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,689
- I wrestled.
- You're a wrestler?

213
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,509
- You wearing tights under that?
- It was a long time ago.

214
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,394
That was high school,
I'm a surgeon now.

215
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:57,231
How would you feel if you seized every
time you went into the operating room?

216
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,434
Yeah, OK.

217
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:06,490
You realize, as your doctor,
I'm not recommending this, right?

218
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,726
I need to get through
my surgeries today.

219
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,591
You're gonna get through
them, just hurt later.

220
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:14,581
You heard of a
Dr. Nelson in neuro?

221
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:19,287
Oh, yeah. Shadow Shepherd.

222
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:21,222
- Shadow Shepherd?
- Yeah.

223
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,707
He's a solid surgeon,

224
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,509
but sort of the JV player
to Shepherd's varsity.

225
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:29,497
The B team to Shepherd's A. The
bricklayer to Shepherd's architect.

226
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:31,031
I get it.

227
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:34,068
Just 'cause the guy doesn't
publish fancy clinical trials,

228
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,339
or take on flashy surgeries, or have
creepy perfect hair, he's less of a man?

229
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:39,791
Kinda.

230
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,086
How'd it go with the lawyers?

231
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,300
They told me my death rate.

232
00:12:54,324 --> 00:12:57,091
These are the people I saved.

233
00:12:58,395 --> 00:13:00,515
These are the people I killed.

234
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:07,485
Most of those were terminal when they
came to you, you were their last chance.

235
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:11,289
And you take on impossible
cases. Look at the clinical trial.

236
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,324
There's so many people.

237
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:16,644
More than Dahmer,
Manson and Bundy combined.

238
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:19,146
You're not looking
at the big picture.

239
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:25,102
This is the big picture.

240
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,908
Shepherd! Thank God you're back.

241
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,978
- Can you swing
two brain biopsies?
- I'm not operating.

242
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,914
I know you've got a big lawsuit
breathing down your neck,

243
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,066
I know you lost a patient,
but I need you back,

244
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:41,947
- doing the job
I hired you to do.
- I am not operating.

245
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,955
I'm not asking, I'm
telling as Chief Surgeon,

246
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:48,193
if you don't get back into
that OR today, Shepherd...

247
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,835
And he just walked out.
Without saying a word.

248
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:01,121
Hunt won't look at me since he
went all <i>Apocalypse Now</i> this morning.

249
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:05,009
Had to get scalpel happy in that
patient's brain and can't face it.

250
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,839
He thinks I'm this wilting
flower. I'm the strong one.

251
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:10,559
- I'm the strong one.
- If I had that
stomach cancer gene?

252
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,901
I'd get that gastrectomy. I
face things, I don't walk away.

253
00:14:14,003 --> 00:14:16,237
Derek walks away. Maybe
walking away is the answer.

254
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:19,607
It's not emotional, it's science.
Have a problem, don't ignore it.

255
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:22,743
If you have to pee, and you
ignore it, it does go away.

256
00:14:22,845 --> 00:14:25,157
You guys are hilarious!

257
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:29,133
Do you even know what she
just said? Or what she just said?

258
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,869
I see you guys in 50
years in a nursing home,

259
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:36,574
just talking at each other with
your hearing aids off. Hi-larious.

260
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:40,411
Oh! I love lunch.

261
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:52,423
What the hell?

262
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,209
Beth?

263
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:58,245
Code blue!

264
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,862
After I take out the
stomach I'll do what, Yang?

265
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:08,689
- Sew the esophageal
anastomosis.
- Or the other option is, Grey?

266
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,724
You could staple
the anastomosis.

267
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,654
Now why would I want to do that?

268
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,896
Fistula rates can be
higher when you hand sew.

269
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:19,066
You might say that using the
old stapler is sort of my specialty.

270
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:24,088
Thought your specialty was baby-sitting.
I'm sure you'd rather be doing that.

271
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,173
Frankly, sir, I feel like I am.

272
00:15:26,275 --> 00:15:29,460
Excuse me, sir, I think
you should feel this.

273
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,278
Right here.

274
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:39,853
Tell me that's not
what I think it is.

275
00:15:43,226 --> 00:15:44,858
Wait, I think I got it.

276
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,545
Liver enzymes are normal,
cardiac workup's negative...

277
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:50,014
- If LDH is a false positive...
- It's a trick question.

278
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:53,367
- What?
- She's fine. Patient X is fine.

279
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:56,670
- She's not fine.
- Her SED rate
is slightly elevated.

280
00:15:56,773 --> 00:16:00,591
- Did we check for
autoimmune disease?
- ANA and CRP were negative.

281
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:04,895
At worst, she's got an anxiety
disorder. The girl is totally fine.

282
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,949
She is not fine!

283
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:10,969
She had hallucinations.

284
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:16,273
She had visual, auditory
and tactile hallucinations

285
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:18,893
about her dead fiancé.

286
00:16:18,995 --> 00:16:23,147
She thought she could
talk to him and touch him.

287
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:25,549
She is not fine.

288
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,952
She is not fine.

289
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,808
You're missing something.

290
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:38,545
You're not looking in the right place.
Go back, figure out what you're missing.

291
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:44,935
She has it? Trish has cancer?

292
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:49,806
The cancer was stage one. We got to it
so early, the gastrectomy was curative.

293
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,625
She had her endoscopy
a few months ago.

294
00:16:51,727 --> 00:16:54,429
It was an aggressive
cancer that grew quickly.

295
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:58,633
- The fact we took
her stomach today...
- It saved your sister's life.

296
00:17:01,971 --> 00:17:04,099
The reason Trish
decides everything,

297
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,958
Thanksgiving,
dinners, vacations...

298
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,738
She's the only one left who
knows how to cook a turkey, Mike.

299
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:13,213
She's the only one left
who likes planning vacations,

300
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:16,184
who ever remembers to
make dinner reservations.

301
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:20,587
She's in charge of us
because everyone else is dead.

302
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,273
I want it. Now.

303
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,443
I want the surgery right now.

304
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,885
Why is she coding when she
seizes? It doesn't make sense.

305
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,099
Not this young. Her
heart should be fine.

306
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:40,541
Beth coded before her seizure not
during. I saw her heart go into v-fib.

307
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:44,178
- She's 17 with
no heart history, Karev.
- I saw it on the monitor.

308
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,348
You think you saw it on the monitor.
Seizures are chaotic. Doctors panic...

309
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,017
I didn't panic. I
know what I saw.

310
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:51,864
You suggesting
I tell her parents

311
00:17:51,888 --> 00:17:54,038
she's been wrongly
treated for six years?

312
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,390
We should run a cardiac
workup with an EP study.

313
00:17:56,492 --> 00:18:01,195
You want me to deliberately shock a
perfectly healthy heart? Absolutely not!

314
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:06,050
- Dr. Hunt?
- If right, it'd explain
the coding.

315
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:09,454
- If he's wrong,
it will kill her!
- I'm not wrong!

316
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,562
Then it's your call, Karev.

317
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,706
Maybe Cristina's right.

318
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,409
Maybe trying to teach
the interns is pointless.

319
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:35,646
Don't listen to Cristina. She
thinks because you'd rather teach

320
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:38,516
than take out a gallbladder,
that you're the new me.

321
00:18:39,936 --> 00:18:44,221
- O'Malley the sequel.
- O'Malley 2.0.

322
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:51,511
You read more journals
and do more research

323
00:18:51,614 --> 00:18:55,866
and log more hours in the skills
lab than any other resident here.

324
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,280
You never give up trying
to be a better doctor.

325
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:02,039
And you don't step
on other people to do it.

326
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,542
I would be lucky
to be the new you.

327
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,218
You gonna tell me
about Patient X?

328
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,254
- I know what we missed.
- I gotta go, George.

329
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:20,057
She had enlarged lymph
nodes, but it's not mono.

330
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,059
What if we missed a
malignancy in her brain?

331
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,895
- You ruled that out
with the CT.
- That was a mistake.

332
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,748
I'd like an MRI with contrast,
maybe biopsy a lymph node.

333
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,401
Whatever's wrong,
it's already in her brain.

334
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,303
Yeah.

335
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,022
Clamp's going in.

336
00:19:35,124 --> 00:19:36,869
I don't feel any masses.

337
00:19:36,893 --> 00:19:38,158
2-O vicryl please.

338
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,844
Sir, if I may one more time,

339
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,912
I think stapling would
be a better choice.

340
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,649
Dr. Bailey, you no longer wish
to be a surgeon in this hospital.

341
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,813
So leave the technical
calls up to me.

342
00:19:47,837 --> 00:19:50,655
I was expressing my opinion
what would be best for my patient.

343
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:54,658
You don't get an opinion! This is
my patient because it's my hospital.

344
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,989
When it's your hospital you
make decisions, but until then,

345
00:19:58,013 --> 00:20:02,132
this is my hospital and I want
all of you people to do what I say!

346
00:20:07,523 --> 00:20:09,223
Yes, sir.

347
00:20:09,325 --> 00:20:11,625
2-O vicryl, please.

348
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:25,256
You're gonna be OK.
You're in really good hands.

349
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:36,249
I'm going to ask you
one more time, Karev.

350
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:38,285
Are you sure about this?

351
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:40,437
Yeah.

352
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:44,124
Then you're on crash cart.

353
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:46,109
If you're wrong...

354
00:20:47,096 --> 00:20:48,812
be ready to use it.

355
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,563
Your path report
came back clear,

356
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:09,177
there were no cancerous cells in
your stomach. How's your pain?

357
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:12,552
The wound hurts a
little... not too bad, right?

358
00:21:12,654 --> 00:21:14,388
Yeah.

359
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:20,759
Don't you remember how much
pain Mom was in at the end?

360
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,362
No.

361
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,810
You used to help me wet
her lips with an ice cube.

362
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:27,334
It was awful. She
couldn't even drink.

363
00:21:27,436 --> 00:21:30,137
She had so many
tubes everywhere.

364
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:34,574
I don't remember. I was two
years old when Mom died.

365
00:21:34,676 --> 00:21:37,611
The only reason I know
it was sad and horrible

366
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,647
is because you
tell me all the time.

367
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,568
I don't have nightmares
about funerals.

368
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:49,256
I don't freak out and think it's cancer
every time I have indigestion. You do.

369
00:21:49,358 --> 00:21:52,259
- Mike...
- This is your fear.

370
00:21:52,862 --> 00:21:54,695
It's not mine.

371
00:21:54,797 --> 00:21:58,799
So just let me decide
when I'm scared.

372
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:06,824
- Let's take the pace
down to 300.
- Vitals are still stable.

373
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:10,406
This is pointless. The study is
showing no sign of arrhythmia.

374
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:14,465
- Wait. She's in v-tach.
- Let's pace her
out of it at 330.

375
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,750
- BP's down to 60 over 10.
- 340. Damn it.

376
00:22:16,852 --> 00:22:18,902
Karev, get in there, now.

377
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,939
Wait, hold the shock.

378
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,416
She's coming out of it.

379
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:36,078
This could be ARVC. The right
ventricle's causing arrhythmia.

380
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:39,873
- The brain doesn't get oxygen.
- And she seizes. Oh, my God.

381
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:46,347
Karev, you just
saved this girl's life.

382
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:02,228
It's OK. It's OK, just breathe.

383
00:23:03,265 --> 00:23:04,976
Put the paddles
down and breathe.

384
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,469
It's OK... it's OK.

385
00:23:20,516 --> 00:23:22,733
Well, it wasn't easy.

386
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:27,003
Not only did I push through my hare
lip reconstruction and a tympanoplasty,

387
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:32,143
but I pulled out a burn graft so
beautiful it could bring a man to tears.

388
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,532
Chief?

389
00:23:38,634 --> 00:23:41,151
You haven't heard from
Shepherd, have you?

390
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:47,458
No, sir. I haven't.

391
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:54,681
Sir, I have tried to let it
go, I know it's not personal,

392
00:23:54,783 --> 00:23:56,950
I understand it's
very hard for you,

393
00:23:57,052 --> 00:24:00,303
I understand you're under
a great deal of pressure,

394
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:03,674
but the way you
yelled at me in the OR,

395
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,343
today, in front of my residents?

396
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,796
Not OK, sir. Not OK at all.

397
00:24:09,898 --> 00:24:15,185
Now you and me, we're going to have
to find a way to work together so you...

398
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:18,288
Not talking to me now?

399
00:24:19,342 --> 00:24:20,607
Oh! Well...

400
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:24,979
That's just real mature, sir.

401
00:24:26,315 --> 00:24:28,515
Real mature.

402
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:33,570
We have a diagnosis.

403
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,374
Go ahead, Dr. Grey.

404
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:42,146
Patient X. An elevated
LDH was our only clue.

405
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:46,400
We found out she had enlarged lymph
nodes and a mole, which was biopsied.

406
00:24:46,501 --> 00:24:51,405
Meanwhile, this MRI with contrast
showed a met on her right temporal lobe.

407
00:24:51,507 --> 00:24:54,024
The biopsy revealed
dividing cells.

408
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:56,459
That, coupled with
further staging tests,

409
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:59,797
led to our final diagnosis
of metastatic melanoma

410
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:02,866
with mets to the
liver, skin, and brain.

411
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:12,876
- Your prognosis?
- With chemo
and radiation...

412
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,696
- a few months.
- At best. The girl's toast.

413
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:17,993
Survival rate's five percent.

414
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,817
If I were her I'd go on
a really good vacation.

415
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,460
Good job, everybody.

416
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,229
That's it?

417
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:36,650
- The last contest,
we got a prize.
- What's our prize?

418
00:25:39,054 --> 00:25:44,658
You think every time you hand
someone a death sentence there's a prize?

419
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:50,614
The prize is, you didn't
screw it up this time.

420
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:53,651
The prize is, you people
actually did something right.

421
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:58,956
The prize is, you were doctors today!
You are doctors. That is the prize.

422
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:19,193
- Adele, what are you
doing here?
- Conference room, Richard. Now.

423
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:23,330
You too, Miranda. Let's go.

424
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:34,741
It's a pacemaker. It's gonna
regulate your abnormal arrhythmias,

425
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:38,011
so you won't have
any more seizures.

426
00:26:38,113 --> 00:26:42,549
So... I'm not sick anymore?

427
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:43,850
A wrestler fixed me.

428
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,253
Not exactly. You have
a serious heart condition,

429
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,667
we're gonna set you
up with a cardiologist...

430
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:51,775
But no one has to know. I
won't be frothing at the mouth,

431
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:54,461
I don't have to wear
a bracelet to school.

432
00:26:54,563 --> 00:26:58,999
- I can cover this with a shirt.
- Yeah. That's something.

433
00:26:59,101 --> 00:27:00,534
It's everything.

434
00:27:00,636 --> 00:27:03,904
Once people see you as sick,
they don't see anything else.

435
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:09,926
Mr. Bimm just called.
We didn't get a trophy.

436
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,830
There's next season.

437
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:16,344
Yeah, we were thinking, maybe
you should try out for choir or debate.

438
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:21,905
Something requiring less movement.
We're just worried for your safety.

439
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:26,626
You don't have to be. We
fixed her. Epileptic bone.

440
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,906
What?

441
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,791
There's no such thing
as an epileptic bone.

442
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,080
Are you a doctor?

443
00:27:34,202 --> 00:27:37,170
So she's like...
totally normal now?

444
00:27:37,273 --> 00:27:41,241
Dude, none of you are normal.
You're freaking band nerds.

445
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,552
Of all the petty,
ridiculous, infantile...

446
00:27:51,654 --> 00:27:53,503
Are you running a
hospital or a playground?

447
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:57,374
- Adele, I will not be
spoken to...
- Hospital or playground?!

448
00:27:59,861 --> 00:28:02,062
- Hospital.
- Then start acting like

449
00:28:02,164 --> 00:28:06,750
the chief of a hospital and
apologize to that woman. Right now.

450
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,704
- Sorry.
- You call that an apology!?

451
00:28:10,806 --> 00:28:13,691
Now you better not leave this
room until you work this out.

452
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:17,277
If I have to drag myself here
through rush hour traffic again

453
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:21,298
- to police this damn
jungle gym...
- Adele, you've made your point.

454
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:26,119
And you wipe that smile off
your face. You're no better.

455
00:28:26,221 --> 00:28:29,139
Tattling on a man to his wife.

456
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,211
When you have your stomach
out, you can't eat sugar.

457
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:38,365
If he's doing this because he doesn't
want to give up damn jelly beans...

458
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,534
- It's more than that.
- Or football

459
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:43,603
or girls or snowboarding,
whatever, it doesn't matter.

460
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:45,099
Not compared to the alternative.

461
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:46,951
We'll be as vigilant as we can.

462
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:50,194
- Use every screening
tool available.
- That won't be necessary.

463
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:53,864
Mikey's gonna have the
surgery. Maybe not today,

464
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:57,184
but I'm gonna be on him like glue,
to my dying breath, until he does.

465
00:28:57,286 --> 00:29:00,053
And if he just wants
to be left alone?

466
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,390
You don't leave the people
you love alone, Dr. Grey.

467
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:06,993
That idiot may not know it, but my
fear is what's going to save his life.

468
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:11,931
<i>♪ Hold on ♪</i>

469
00:29:15,437 --> 00:29:19,423
I learned a lot, diagnosing a
patient from beginning to end.

470
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:23,159
So... thank you for teaching us.

471
00:29:26,248 --> 00:29:27,947
What would you say?

472
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:34,521
To Patient X. How would
you break the news?

473
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,073
Um...

474
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:39,909
I would say that
I was very sorry

475
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:44,698
and that there were
support groups...

476
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,285
I don't know. What do you say
to somebody who's going to...

477
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,606
You say they have a choice.

478
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,376
They can run away
and hide from it,

479
00:29:56,478 --> 00:29:58,444
or they can face it.

480
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,613
You say to be around
people who love them,

481
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:04,034
it's gonna be the toughest fight of
their life, no one should do it alone.

482
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,820
And then you give them the odds,

483
00:30:06,922 --> 00:30:11,508
and even though a five percent survival
rate is bad, it's really bad, you say...

484
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:19,282
- You say...
- Screw the odds.

485
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:22,051
People die of the hiccups.

486
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,065
My mother died of the hiccups.

487
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:28,574
Survival rate for that
is, what, 100 percent?

488
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:32,428
The odds are that she
should be alive right now.

489
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:35,699
The odds are that
the odds mean crap.

490
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:40,520
So people should face
it and they should fight.

491
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:46,143
Maybe not those words.

492
00:30:47,228 --> 00:30:51,697
No... exactly those words.

493
00:30:54,703 --> 00:30:56,970
Thank you, Dr. Grey.

494
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:02,725
How's she doing?

495
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,395
- Uh, she's stable.
- Hmm.

496
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,413
You did a hell of a job.

497
00:31:07,516 --> 00:31:08,877
The chief's gonna hear about it.

498
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:11,501
Pretty impressive
for a resident.

499
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:14,699
Fix that attitude, you could
be the future of this hospital,

500
00:31:14,723 --> 00:31:18,942
the one to watch. You go, Karev!

501
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:27,383
Iz!

502
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,432
Hunt's letting me do the distal
anastomosis on his fem-pop.

503
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,640
- That's awesome.
- It's crazy.

504
00:31:33,742 --> 00:31:38,762
They told me I could be the future
of this hospital, the resident to watch.

505
00:31:38,847 --> 00:31:41,447
I mean, I'm not the
kind of guy who...

506
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,184
I don't rise, OK? I
sink to the bottom.

507
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:47,487
And now I'm getting
all this... this respect.

508
00:31:47,589 --> 00:31:52,325
And... And you... you gotta stop
wasting your time with this Patient X crap.

509
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:54,845
- Alex...
- I know you like teaching,

510
00:31:54,947 --> 00:31:59,515
but you need to start treating
real patients with real surgeries

511
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:03,086
because once they see you
as weak, it's over, and Iz...

512
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:04,982
you could be a great surgeon.

513
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,741
We could be great together.

514
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,677
You just, you gotta
stop screwing around.

515
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:15,398
I don't wanna be the future of this
hospital if you're not with me. OK?

516
00:32:16,784 --> 00:32:18,485
OK.

517
00:32:21,823 --> 00:32:23,924

That didn't exactly
leave me many options.

524
00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:02,528
Would you have reacted like this
if I left general surgery for neuro?

525
00:33:02,631 --> 00:33:04,764
- Or cardio?
- I don't follow.

526
00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:07,884
Is it because you regard
peds as a soft specialty,

527
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,285
is that what's bothering you?

528
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:12,088
- That's ridiculous.
- Maybe. But...

529
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,442
It seems that every time I do
something you perceive as "soft,"

530
00:33:15,544 --> 00:33:19,129
like having a baby, taking
some time off to see my baby,

531
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:23,233
specializing in
babies... I'm dead to you.

532
00:33:23,318 --> 00:33:25,935
- Wanna know what I think?
- Not particularly.

533
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:30,089
I think you're scared
that you've gone soft.

534
00:33:30,191 --> 00:33:33,109
You blame this hospital's
decline on it. Know what I think?

535
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:36,212
- You're gonna tell me.
- It's not doing
you one bit of good!

536
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,114
Surgeons are
dropping like dominoes.

537
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:41,268
So, maybe it's time you got in
touch with your feminine side.

538
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:44,087
Maybe you need a little soft.

539
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:50,376
You still shouldn't
have ratted me out.

540
00:33:50,478 --> 00:33:54,731
- Sorry.
- Me, too.

541
00:34:02,924 --> 00:34:04,056
What are you doing?

542
00:34:04,158 --> 00:34:06,476
Assigning myself to
trauma with you tomorrow.

543
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:10,080
I'm a big girl. I can
handle my share of trauma.

544
00:34:10,182 --> 00:34:12,732
And I get to decide
when I've had enough.

545
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:19,071
It's gonna take a lot more than
a bad dream to scare me off.

546
00:34:21,442 --> 00:34:23,709
It is more than a bad dream.

547
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:26,946

but I need your help.

552
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,838
I need you to bring Derek back.

553
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:57,327
And he's not "fine."

00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:03,200

just want to be left alone.

555
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:18,932
He's planning to propose.

556
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:23,036
He's been carrying
around a big ring for weeks.

557
00:35:23,138 --> 00:35:26,172
That's not a man who
wants to be left alone.

563
00:35:55,787 --> 00:36:00,806
I'd say our survival rate is about
three percent. And that's bad.

564
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,776
But it's not nothing.

565
00:36:02,878 --> 00:36:05,896
I don't think we should
give up on this. Not yet...

566
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:07,914
OK.

567
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,454
You think you broke
me, Little Grey?

568
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:15,572
You're the one who
put me back together.

569
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:24,447
- Hand.
- Hand.

570
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:28,684
Mark. I've got a couple of
Shepherd's post-ops to check in on,

571
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:32,421
- but after that,
feel like a drink?
- How about a rain check, John?

573
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:38,527
It's Jim.

574
00:36:47,355 --> 00:36:51,791
So I've had quite a day. Got my
ass handed to me by Alex Karev.

575
00:36:51,893 --> 00:36:55,679
A second year resident.
Which is humbling for a surgeon,

576
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:00,082
- especially a know-it-all...
- We don't have to do this,
be friends.

577
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:03,236
It's a big hospital, lots of
floors, lots of places to hide.

578
00:37:03,338 --> 00:37:05,889
I'm perfectly OK with doing
that for the next few years.

579
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,307
You're not hearing me, Calliope.

580
00:37:08,409 --> 00:37:11,261
Sometimes I panic in
the moment, I call it wrong.

581
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:13,446
I misjudge a situation.

582
00:37:13,548 --> 00:37:18,134
So if you're up for it, I'd
like to take you to dinner.

583
00:37:22,623 --> 00:37:24,223
Maybe.

584
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:26,376
Maybe?

585
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:28,961
My schedule's kind of
insane right now, so...

586
00:37:29,064 --> 00:37:30,846
I'll get back to you.

587
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:37,437
