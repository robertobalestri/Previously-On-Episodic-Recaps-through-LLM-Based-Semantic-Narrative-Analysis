2
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:10,909
- Chicken!
- Good chicken.

3
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:12,138
It's chicken.

4
00:00:12,162 --> 00:00:13,612
I know it's chicken.

5
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:15,191
I want to know
what it tastes like.

6
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:16,715
Tastes like chicken.

7
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:19,818
- I'm having surgery today.
- Maybe. If the mets
have shrunk.

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,089
I am maybe having surgery and as
such I cannot taste the chicken for myself.

9
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,820
So I really need you guys
to tell me what it tastes like.

10
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:30,173
I need to announce it on Meredith
and Derek's wedding website.

11
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,925
- There's a website?
- Can you please be
more articulate

12
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,466
than just "chicken?"

13
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:37,752
Yay! Oh!

14
00:00:37,854 --> 00:00:39,838
That's the one!

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,857
Very dapper, Dr. Shepherd.

16
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,743
You're serious about this?
It's not some cruel joke?

17
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:47,562
And you look fantastic.
He looks fantastic, right?

18
00:00:47,665 --> 00:00:49,948
- Yeah.
- Whatever.

19
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:52,979
<i>Remember when we were
little and we'd accidentally</i>

20
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:55,287
<i>bite a kid on the playground?</i>

21
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,222
- Good luck.
- Good chicken.

22
00:00:58,342 --> 00:00:59,491
So?

23
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,409
Pork!

24
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:05,463
<i>Our teachers would
go, "Say you're sorry."</i>

25
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,216
Oh! Fine, I'll
taste the chicken.

26
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:12,053
<i>We would say it, but
we wouldn't mean it.</i>

27
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,456
<i>Because the stupid kid
we bit... totally deserved it.</i>

28
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:17,309
Sorry. I'm sorry.

29
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:21,412
Take care now.

30
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,193
Hey. So, I can't afford rent.

31
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:26,251
- Owen just told me
to "Take care now."
- Nice. Three words.

32
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,448
More than she's getting
from any of her family.

33
00:01:28,472 --> 00:01:31,573
My mom, silent. My
aunts, silent. My sister Aria?

34
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:35,627
I know, I know how much power
my father wields. But seriously?

35
00:01:35,713 --> 00:01:38,413
What am I, invisible? Dead
to them? To my mother?

36
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,259
You just have to give them time.

37
00:01:40,283 --> 00:01:45,053
Why can't you just tell them you
broke up? It's no one's business, right?

38
00:01:45,155 --> 00:01:47,689
And I will leave
you to ponder that.

39
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:52,093
<i>But as we get older, making
amends isn't so simple.</i>

40
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,729
- You really think I should lie?
- I think you should pay rent.

41
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:57,366
But, you know,
whatever. Take care now.

42
00:01:57,468 --> 00:02:01,003
<i>After the playground days
are over, you can't just say it.</i>

43
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:03,371
<i>- You have to mean it.</i>
- I got you a present.

44
00:02:03,473 --> 00:02:06,519
You can't give me money. Even
if you are a fancy plastic surgeon.

45
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:10,344
I'm not your charity case. Not your
mistress. I am your friend. Your equal.

46
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:11,947
It's not money.

47
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:15,061
Really? I was just doing the
"poor but proud" thing for show.

48
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:17,835
Better than money. Wait.

49
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:22,407
<i>Of course, when you become a
doctor, "sorry" is not a happy word.</i>

50
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,121
<i>It either means, "You're
dying and I can't help"...</i>

51
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,080
She fell out of a tree
and broke all her limbs.

52
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:30,882
Ooh! That is better.

53
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:34,319
<i>Or it means, "This
is really gonna hurt."</i>

54
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,283
How many days?

55
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:40,692
- Twenty-nine.
- Fresh from rehab?

56
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:43,027
I could tell you some
good meetings in the area.

57
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,410
Thanks, they gave
me a whole list.

58
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,002
One more thing
we have in common.

59
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,476
Have you... talked to Meredith?

60
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:00,562
To Lexie?

61
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,672
Ow!

62
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:14,059
OK, Willow, I'm afraid your
cheekbone looks broken, too.

63
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:18,063
I'll need to wait a few weeks until
the swelling goes down to repair that.

64
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:20,899
In a few weeks, I'm
gonna be up a tree in Utah.

65
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,601
Those corporate bastards,

66
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,921
the same ones who just
bulldozed me out of Kaili?

67
00:03:26,023 --> 00:03:29,807
They wanna clear-cut acres to
build another ski condo complex.

68
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,142
Sons of bitches.

69
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:34,490
There is so much about that
sentence I do not understand.

70
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,716
You were "bulldozed"
out of something?

71
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:42,537
Kaili. She was the tree that I
was living in for the past six weeks.

72
00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:45,691
She was a beautiful
200-year-old oak

73
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,910
in a grove full of beautiful
200-year-old oaks.

74
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:51,312
You named a tree "Kaili?"

75
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:55,483
Kaili is Hawaiian for
"divine beauty and wisdom."

76
00:03:55,585 --> 00:03:58,186
And she was all of those things.

77
00:03:58,288 --> 00:04:02,090
She was all of those
things and now she's gone.

78
00:04:02,192 --> 00:04:05,693
They're all gone. And
for what? Yuppie housing?

79
00:04:05,795 --> 00:04:07,679
Those corporate bastards.

80
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:12,083
I'm sorry, but you're not gonna be
climbing any trees for a long while.

81
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,130
How does one
exactly live in a tree?

82
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:17,789
I mean, how exactly does
one, say, eliminate waste?

83
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:22,394
He's asking where your poo goes, which
may not be the most sensitive question

84
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:25,197
while she's mourning
the death of her...

85
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:26,939
tree friend.

86
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:38,560
Excuse me, doctor?

87
00:04:38,662 --> 00:04:41,529
Oh! Excuse me, young
and yummy doctor.

88
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:45,099
- Can I help you?
- I don't know, can you?

89
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,601
Are you looking for
someone, ma'am?

90
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:50,221
Oh, gosh, I'm gonna pretend
you didn't just call me ma'am,

91
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:53,057
because I have this image of you
and me in my head playing doctor

92
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,959
and that just kinda ruined it.

93
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:59,230
OK. I'm gonna go back to work
now. But good luck with... whatever.

94
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,399
Well, I am looking for a doctor.

95
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:05,153
Gosh, I guess she's a
patient now. Isobel Stevens?

96
00:05:05,255 --> 00:05:07,155
I'm, uh...

97
00:05:07,257 --> 00:05:08,990
I'm an old friend.

98
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,789
- After you.
- Oh, a doctor
and a gentleman.

99
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:16,181
Now, that's a double yummy.
Oh, my God, who's getting married?

100
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:20,452
- Oh, my God. Mom. What are you doing here?
- Mom?

101
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:23,622
Shh! Cricket, you don't want
that hot doctor to think I'm old.

102
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,498
Hey. You got paged, too?

103
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,561
Yeah. "Report to the
chief's office, stat."

104
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,236
What do you think? Why?
Why would he page us stat?

105
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,972
I don't know. We kill anyone
lately and don't remember?

106
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:50,165
Your father's here.

107
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,902
He's 29 days sober,
just out of rehab.

108
00:05:54,004 --> 00:05:56,655
He's taking it seriously.
He's working his steps.

109
00:05:56,757 --> 00:06:00,258
The ninth step is to make
amends wherever possible.

110
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,193
It's the key to an
alcoholic's recovery.

111
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:05,913
To take responsibility for
the wreckage of his past.

112
00:06:06,016 --> 00:06:09,768
I paged you here to ask
you to please hear him out.

113
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,606
As a favor to me, to
please hear him out.

114
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,444
- Uh, I'm covering
the pit, chief...
- I'll cover it.

115
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,046
- But there's a trauma...
- I've got it, Meredith.

116
00:06:23,934 --> 00:06:25,466
Please.

117
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,386
Please.

118
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,083
What are you doing?

119
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,219
The chief asked me
to cover Mer in the pit.

120
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:52,877
- I'm on Hunt's service
all month.
- O'Malley! Hey there, now.

121
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,479
O'Malley, update me.

122
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:59,016
Two ambulances. Three patients,
one critical. Multiple gunshot wounds.

123
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:02,019
Mike Carlson, 35, multiple GSWs.

124
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:04,923
Last BP, 88 systolic
after two boluses of LR.

125
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,057
Where was he shot?

126
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,942
Chest, abdomen,
back, legs, shoulder...

127
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:10,205
- Someone meant business.
- Not so sure about that.

128
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,025
She didn't mean it, it was
an accident. She really didn't.

129
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:15,199
She's sorry. Maddy,
tell them you're sorry.

130
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,402
She's the shooter?

131
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,354
Somebody page the chief.

132
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,329
- Breath sounds are better.
- Three to
the thoracoabdominal area.

133
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:28,671
What's that bring the count to?

134
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:31,511
Three plus seven to the
legs... Two on the side.

135
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,729
Could be through. Put a swab
through, see where it goes.

136
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,937
- Do we roll him now?
- Finish his catheter.

137
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,123
- Does it enter and exit?
- Hold on.

138
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,708
Yeah, that makes 11.

139
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,761
- What can we infer from these?
- Blood in the urine. Guessing kidney.

140
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,729
O'Malley, let's roll
him. On your count.

141
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,581
One, two, three.

142
00:07:47,683 --> 00:07:50,268
- Yeah, more wounds here.
- Yang, page Shepherd.

143
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,354
Let's get an accurate count
while we have him positioned.

144
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:58,026
Maddy, how's this feel?
Does it hurt when I do this?

145
00:07:58,128 --> 00:07:59,128
Good.

146
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,262
What about this cut?

147
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:03,915
Can you tell me how you
got this big cut on your face?

148
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,650
She's scared.

149
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,764
Scared she did a bad thing
and you're gonna take her away.

150
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:11,690
The police will want to talk to both
of you about how Maddy got the gun.

151
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:14,125
We called social services
and they'll be here soon.

152
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,911
They'll give you the support
you need to come back from this.

153
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:21,232
And nobody's gonna take you
away from your mom, OK, Maddy?

154
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,119
It hit her in the face.
The gun, the kickback.

155
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:27,872
Huh...

156
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:31,092
- 'Cause this doesn't
look like...
- That's how she got the cut.

157
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:33,511
Her daddy shoots
targets in the backyard.

158
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:37,165
He put the gun down for a
minute. It was really stupid.

159
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,484
She never meant to hurt him.

160
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:43,346
OK. You'll tell the
police that and it'll be OK.

161
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:44,936
Everything'll be OK.

162
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:51,179
And I'm so deeply sorry...

163
00:08:52,882 --> 00:08:56,935
for every time that I ever
hurt you or disappointed you,

164
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,903
or let you down.

165
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:08,396
I don't deserve your
forgiveness, but I hope...

166
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:14,068
I so hope that you'll give
me the opportunity to earn it.

167
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:32,837
Thank you. Congratulations on...

168
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,259
You seem well.

169
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:37,692
Good luck.

170
00:09:55,412 --> 00:09:58,412
And you remember
Jade, from 114? Well...

171
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,314
She had a spot of cancer
last year. It was breast cancer.

172
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,962
That was such a shame, I
thought. She had such a great rack.

173
00:10:03,986 --> 00:10:06,204
Remember what a
great rack she had?

174
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:09,941
You used to do all those exercises
to try to get yours to grow like hers.

175
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,876
Anyway.

176
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,479
My point is, Jade,
she had 'em cut off.

177
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,948
Both, just to be
on the safe side.

178
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,316
They look even
better now. For real.

179
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:23,121
Life gave her lemons
and she made cantaloupes!

180
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:27,809
So, maybe, honey, there's an
upside in this for you, too. Right?

181
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:31,513
Um... Mom. Just,
uh, just listen, OK?

182
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:34,548
I... I don't have breast cancer.

183
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:42,640
OK. I have skin cancer, or
what started out as skin cancer...

184
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,493
Hang on. Skin cancer?

185
00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:49,797
Oh, God, Isobel Stevens, oh,
you scared the hell out of me.

186
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:54,268
And you made me come all the way up
here to Seattle for some ugly old mole?

187
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,449
- Sweetheart.
- No, I didn't.

188
00:10:56,473 --> 00:10:59,006
I didn't make you
come up here. I, uh...

189
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:03,844
I didn't even call you. I'm really...
I'm curious. Who did? Who called?

190
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,614
Who called her?

191
00:11:06,716 --> 00:11:10,384
Seriously. Who called her?

192
00:11:15,058 --> 00:11:17,308
You OK? Are you crying?

193
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,260
- My dad's here.
- OK...

194
00:11:19,362 --> 00:11:23,281
He's here and he's sober, and
I'd really like for you to meet him.

195
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,466
Oh...

196
00:11:24,568 --> 00:11:26,451
Oh.

197
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:29,020
Umm... Oh.

198
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,522
How about dinner
tonight? Camparo's at 8?

199
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,191
Lexie, uh...

200
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,895
dads historically
do not love me.

201
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:41,415
And by that, I mean that
when I was a teenager...

202
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,402
dads did not love me,

203
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:47,705
and then that's the last time
I had to meet anyone's dad.

204
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,623
I'm crazy about you.

205
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:53,344
I know that my dad will be, too.
You have nothing to worry about.

206
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,207
That's what you said when
you told me to tell Derek.

207
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:59,083
Lexie, I'm closer to your
dad's age than yours.

208
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:03,304
So I'm thinking he may
not love me so much.

209
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:05,957
You know, what
we have is fantastic.

210
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,293
Why don't we
just keep it for us?

211
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,863
Excuse me, I'm looking for
my sister, Karen Zelmann?

212
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,743
We have a Willow
Zelmann in there.

213
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:17,401
- Her name is Karen.
- My name is Willow!

214
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:22,990
I told you this would happen. I told
you to come out of the damn tree.

215
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:27,695
How'd it go?

216
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:31,932
Dr. Grey, Maddy could use a little
cleaning and repair. I'm being paged.

217
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:35,352
- Absolutely.
- Meredith.

218
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,757
- You OK?
- I'm great.

219
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,043
Thanks.

220
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:45,647
Hey, Maddy, I'm Dr. Grey.

221
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:48,060
Mind if I take a look at
that cut on your face?

222
00:12:48,084 --> 00:12:51,151
She's so sorry. She's so sorry.

223
00:12:54,057 --> 00:12:56,640
Is my daddy gonna die?

224
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,960
I don't know. I hope not.

225
00:13:00,062 --> 00:13:02,141
Five bullets still inside.

226
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:03,375
How many gunshots total?

227
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,582
Twenty-five wounds total,

228
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,604
five are lodged inside,
two graze wounds,

229
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:08,486
nine through and
through, so about 17.

230
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:12,257
Seventeen? Thought this
was an accidental shooting.

231
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:15,943
- How come?
- How come what?

232
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:20,565
How come he don't die?
I shot him lots of times.

233
00:13:27,624 --> 00:13:29,390
How come he don't die?

234
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:37,282
She's just a
little girl, a baby.

235
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:40,301
She wasn't really trying
to kill him, she was...

236
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,853
She doesn't even
understand what that means.

237
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,756
She was just trying to stop him,
she was only trying to stop him.

238
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,810
So that cut on her face
didn't come from the gun?

239
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,645
He was hitting her.

240
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,546
He loves us.

241
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:55,716
Daddy loves us, Maddy.
Sometimes he just gets mad.

242
00:13:55,818 --> 00:14:00,238
And he's been working on it.
He's been working on it so hard.

243
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,907
But she was just
trying to stop him.

244
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,725
She wasn't trying to kill him.

245
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:07,244
Please understand.

246
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,881
She's just a little girl.

247
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:17,956
Uh-huh. Oh. Really?

248
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:21,425
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Really?

249
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:25,563
Oh... Yeah, that's great,
that's great. Oh, thank you.

250
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:29,100
Yeah, thank you, hon.
Thanks a million. Oh!

251
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,136
Oh, that's great news, Cricket!

252
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,154
You're gonna be just fine!

253
00:14:34,256 --> 00:14:36,107
Oh, yeah?

254
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,810
Let me guess. Your
psychic told you that?

255
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:43,748
It's not just any old psychic. He's
the best that I've ever heard of.

256
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,886
Anyway, he said that skin cancer
is highly curable if caught early.

257
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:51,772
Oh, that's so great. A
psychic with Internet access.

258
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:56,276
Let me guess how much that call
cost you, mother. $19.99 a minute?

259
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:58,123
When you have a
sick child, Cricket,

260
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,993
money's not really the
first thing on your mind.

261
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:03,937
You seem like a very
capable doctor, Dr. Bailey.

262
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:09,290
Can I trust that you caught
my daughter's skin cancer early?

263
00:15:09,392 --> 00:15:13,461
- Um, well, Mrs. Stevens...
- Oh, no. Call me Robbie, hon.

264
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:17,347
No, Mom, don't call her
"hon." Don't call Bailey "hon."

265
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,985
You know, if you have
questions, you can just ask me.

266
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:26,273
She's very busy and this thing
I have... It's complicated, so...

267
00:15:26,376 --> 00:15:29,643
I know it's complicated,
Isobel. I'm not a complete idiot.

268
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,529
Now, I saw this
thing on Tyra's show...

269
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:35,410
There was this woman who
had a mole on her private parts.

270
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,085
The dermatologist did not check

271
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:41,250
'cause she thought the gynie
would've done it. The gynie didn't do it...

272
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,586
Maybe she didn't even go to
the gynie... Anyway, it was bad.

273
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,039
She was bald and everything.

274
00:15:47,063 --> 00:15:50,815
She did not have a mole
on her private parts, did she?

275
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:54,685
No, ma'am. No, she did not.

276
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,421
Good.

277
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:01,854
We need to take him in now.
GSWs to the abdomen, hematuria,

278
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,512
vital signs are unstable. Ma'am,
he has major internal injuries.

279
00:16:05,614 --> 00:16:07,676
We're rushing
him to surgery now.

280
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,968
Wait! Maddy needs to tell her
daddy she's sorry before he goes.

281
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,387
Baby, you need to tell
your daddy you're sorry.

282
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:15,422
Maddy, people die in surgery.

283
00:16:15,524 --> 00:16:18,893
You don't want your daddy to die
without telling him how sorry you are.

284
00:16:18,995 --> 00:16:21,462
Come on, let's go
tell him we love him.

285
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,815
- You know? No. No.
- What?

286
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,951
Maddy, stay right here, OK?

287
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,464
- Dr. Grey...
- No.

288
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,398
She will not go
apologize to him.

289
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,400
You should be
apologizing to her.

290
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,085
I understand you're a victim,

291
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:37,106
but there's no room for you to be
when your six-year-old is on the line.

292
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:41,181
She's stronger than you. Your
six-year-old is stronger than you.

293
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:44,079
At least she did something.
She stood up for the two of you,

294
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,048
which is more
than you did for her.

295
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:48,392
No, she won't apologize to him.

296
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,647
Thank you so much.
All right, I'll call you back.

297
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,560
Listen, I have great news.

298
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,901
I have a contact at
Schuster and Werner.

299
00:17:01,003 --> 00:17:02,737
More like Dirtbag and Felon.

300
00:17:02,838 --> 00:17:06,285
They've agreed to pay your medical
bills and to not sue you for trespassing

301
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:08,959
if you sign a contract
saying you won't sue them

302
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:11,423
and you won't trespass on
their properties ever again.

303
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:15,966
Do you know how many acres of forest
they have single-handedly destroyed?

304
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:19,120
How many ecosystems
will never be restored?

305
00:17:19,222 --> 00:17:22,006
The bees are dying, Julie.
The temperature is rising!

306
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:25,559
I'm sorry. Is it possible I could
have a moment alone with my sister?

307
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:35,319
- You'll sign this deal, Karen.
- My name is Willow!

308
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:38,038
Can't say I'm sorry
I never had siblings.

309
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,974
- They're yelling
'cause they care.
- That how it works?

310
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:45,145
Yeah, it is, in
some families. It is.

311
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:49,233
I expected them to yell, you
know? I didn't expect silence.

312
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:52,136
Call them and claim
temporary insanity.

313
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:55,384
You don't have to end it with
Roller-girl. Just say you did.

314
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,773
Yang said the same thing.

315
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,054
That's because it's
none of their business.

316
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,638
There's no reason you
should have to hurt this much.

317
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:15,460
I can see that
you're angry with me,

318
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,562
and maybe angry
with your mother...

319
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:21,515
Don't do that. I'm not your
friend, and I'm not your family.

320
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:24,596
You don't get to call me into
your office on personal business,

321
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,065
and you don't get to speak
to me this way right now.

322
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:30,289
It's an abuse of power. I'm
a resident. I work for you.

323
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:33,806
You have to speak to me like
I'm a resident. And for the record?

324
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:38,199
Someone had to stand up for that
girl. I make no apologies for that.

325
00:18:39,936 --> 00:18:42,336
You want to just be a resident?

326
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:47,642
Fine. All right then.

327
00:18:47,744 --> 00:18:52,246
That woman is a victim
of domestic violence.

328
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:56,250
This hospital is supposed to be a
safe place for her to come tell her story.

329
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:59,470
As her doctors, it is
our job to help her.

330
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,322
You did not do your job.

331
00:19:01,424 --> 00:19:03,774
You further battered
a battered woman.

332
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,093
- What about...
- Dr. Grey!

333
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:08,162
You will stay away
from that child.

334
00:19:08,264 --> 00:19:10,197
You will stay away
from that family.

335
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:12,949
You will not come
within 100 feet of them.

336
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:16,470
If you do, you will be
suspended from this hospital,

337
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:21,525
pending re-evaluation of your
emotional and mental fitness for residency.

338
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:35,639
The IVC and the aorta are nicked.
O'Malley, get in there with some clips.

339
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,559
Gonna need the
angled vascular clamp.

340
00:19:38,661 --> 00:19:41,862
Nothing's stopping.
Still bleeding out.

341
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:45,065
Don't move, Yang! Need
some more suction in there.

342
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:47,767
- I know Webber
is your friend.
- Not about Richard.

343
00:19:47,837 --> 00:19:50,437
It is. It is about him.

344
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:53,852
I have to deal with him on a
professional basis every day.

345
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:57,522
I've tried to draw a line with
him and he won't respect it.

346
00:19:57,546 --> 00:19:59,586
He uses his
relationship with you...

347
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,672
- Richard doesn't...
- Stop defending him.

348
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:04,096
Be on my side. I need
you to be on my side.

349
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,686
- OK.
- He's not your best friend.

350
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,901
He's not your Cristina. Which
is why I feel OK to say to you

351
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:11,687
he is not invited to our
wedding. I swear, Derek,

352
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,745
if he's there, I won't be.
I'm the bride, so I have to be.

353
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:18,349
So I'm begging you.
He's not invited. OK?

354
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,584
- OK.
- Thank you.

355
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,853
Mm-hmm.

356
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:26,641
If you don't make this deal, who's
gonna pay your bills? Take care of you?

357
00:20:26,743 --> 00:20:29,510
They tried to kill me,
just like they killed Kaili,

358
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:32,779
just like they kill all
those defenseless trees,

359
00:20:32,882 --> 00:20:35,799
all of the creatures
that live in those trees.

360
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,669
You are not a defenseless
tree-living creature.

361
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:42,256
You are an adult woman who
made a decision to trespass.

362
00:20:42,358 --> 00:20:46,460
It was unbelievably stupid, naive,
just unbelievably irresponsible.

363
00:20:46,562 --> 00:20:50,047
- What about
unbelievably brave?
- Excuse me?

364
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,310
Trees may not
be my thing, but...

365
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,535
even if it was
stupid, it was brave.

366
00:20:54,637 --> 00:20:57,466
She slept in a 200-year-old
tree and watched as a bulldozer

367
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,335
knocked her off. She was
standing for what she believed.

368
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,237
You have to admit, she's brave.

369
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,762
How can trees not be your thing?

370
00:21:07,283 --> 00:21:10,818
Karen? Karen?

371
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,181
Damn it. Pulse is
weak. Start her on O2.

372
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,923
See if you can get
a femoral pulse.

373
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:19,559
She's bleeding out.
We need her stabilized.

374
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:23,213
- What's happening to my sister?
- Julie, you need to clear out.

375
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:26,350
- Get her out of here.
- Karen? Karen?

376
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,972
Get her ready for transport and
tell the OR we're on our way, now!

377
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,740
Damn it. Too many bleeders.

378
00:21:32,842 --> 00:21:35,509
Hang another bag of O neg
and get me some fibrin sealant.

379
00:21:35,611 --> 00:21:37,728
- Can I help?
- You are helping.

380
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,247
You've got more bleeders
than you have hands.

381
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:42,600
- Sorry.
- No, that's it.

382
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:44,635
You get in there and take over.

383
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,570
- Yang, run to my truck!
- What?

384
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,690
Run to my truck. It's
where I always park it.

385
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:52,376
Run fast. In the glove
box, there's a green bag.

386
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,890
- Pull harder
on that retractor.
- I am a surgeon...

387
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:58,549
I'm trying to save
a life, Yang. Run!

388
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:06,857
Oh... The Lovers card.

389
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,392
Do you know what this means?

390
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:12,196
Yes. No. Yes... Mom,
can you please shut up?

391
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:14,715
Meat. Definitely
some kind of meat.

392
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:16,967
You're killing me,
you know that?

393
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,936
It means the sex is hot.

394
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,656
I bet that little mole
didn't get in the way, right?

395
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,725
Honey, hey. Listen.

396
00:22:24,827 --> 00:22:28,528
Isn't it time for my scan? Isn't
it time for my scan right now?

397
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:30,080
I'll go check.

398
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,117
- See if I can
get things moving.
- Thank you.

399
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:37,470
Tell me about Dr. Hottie. How
long have you been together?

400
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:44,044
Mom? It's not just a mole.

401
00:22:44,146 --> 00:22:46,930
I have stage IV melanoma.

402
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,967
It's in my organs.
It's not just a mole.

403
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:54,154
You don't have skin
on your organs, hon.

404
00:22:54,256 --> 00:22:56,022
Doesn't make a
whole lotta sense.

405
00:22:58,094 --> 00:23:00,627
Don't just sigh at me, Isobel.

406
00:23:00,729 --> 00:23:03,481
Just, you know... just explain.

407
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,650
OK, um...

408
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:11,922
You remember when Grammy
had that tumor on her thyroid?

409
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,826
Grammy died.

410
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:19,563
She died. She...

411
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:23,033
Really soon after
that, she died.

412
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,089
Why are you...

413
00:23:30,726 --> 00:23:32,559
telling me...

414
00:23:33,428 --> 00:23:37,648
You have a mole.

415
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,118
I don't understand...
You have a mole.

416
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:45,255
OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
that was a bad comparison.

417
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,885
What I have is nothing
like what Grammy had.

418
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:50,527
- No. No...
- OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

419
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:54,164
Just breathe. It's OK.
I'm OK. Just breathe. OK?

420
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:58,818
It's OK. It's OK. I'm
OK. Just breathe.

421
00:24:03,826 --> 00:24:06,310
I've got a good
feeling about this.

422
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:08,892
I think those mets
are shrunk way down,

423
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:12,291
and I think I'm gonna go
right in and take the rest out.

424
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:13,984
Really? You think that?

425
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:17,321
Did your psychic tell you so?

426
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:21,191
This scan has to be
good. It has to be good.

427
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:25,963
Listen, if it's not, it's not the end of
the world. There are other therapies...

428
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:27,247
She'll never leave.

429
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:30,668
If this scan isn't good? If I
can't give her good news...

430
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,919
She won't leave.

431
00:24:32,021 --> 00:24:35,405
I love my mom. I don't
mean to sound... ungrateful...

432
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:37,107
I just...

433
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,793
It was me. I called her.

434
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,562
I really...

435
00:24:41,664 --> 00:24:45,282
I thought it was
Alex. Or George.

436
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:47,651
It was me. Because...

437
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:49,714
I'd want to know
if my kid was sick.

438
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,739
And if I was sick, I
would want my mom.

439
00:24:52,841 --> 00:24:55,425
I thought you were
being too proud,

440
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:58,595
or you were trying
to protect her.

441
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:01,843
Now I get that you were
trying to protect yourself.

442
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:05,703
She's not a bad person.
She was a great mom.

443
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:09,006
She's just... limited. She's...

444
00:25:09,525 --> 00:25:11,158
limited.

445
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,660
This scan has to be good.

446
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:18,131
It has to be good.
It has to be good.

447
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,596
Hang more blood.
Come on, Willow.

448
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,005
Come on. You lived in a tree. You
crapped in a bucket, for God's sake.

449
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,341
- You can do this.
- She crapped in a bucket?

450
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:30,010
- What're you doing here?
- Saw it on the board.

451
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,796
Never seen an intermedullary
rod put into a femur.

452
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:33,731
So... bucket?

453
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:36,133
Yeah. Bucket on a pulley.

454
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:40,187
She's up in the tree. She
lowers a crap bucket to her friend,

455
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:45,258
every day, who empties it, cleans it,
puts food in it and sends it back up.

456
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,561
- That's friendship.
- Yeah.

457
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:55,318
They teach us in med school
how not to care so much.

458
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:57,671
We drape the patients,
so we don't see faces.

459
00:25:57,773 --> 00:26:00,657
We do a thousand
things to care a little less.

460
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,193
But you care like
crazy and I love that.

461
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:05,696
And I'll keep loving that,

462
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:08,098
even if you decide
to lie to your family.

463
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:15,172
Nice work, Yang. Open the bag.

464
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:17,757
See the bottle
with the blue label?

465
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:21,619
Open it, pour it in a sterile
basin and give it to O'Malley.

466
00:26:23,032 --> 00:26:26,767
Shake it onto the wound. Right
over the bleeders. A lot of it.

467
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:29,185
What is this stuff?

468
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:32,634
Use it in the field all the time.
It's not FDA-approved, but...

469
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:36,476
it's saved a lot of lives. When you
don't have time to stitch a guy up,

470
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:40,430
pour some of this on, and it
holds things till you get to an OR.

471
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,127
Look, it's locking up the wound.

472
00:26:42,151 --> 00:26:44,195
Replicates the clotting process.

473
00:26:44,219 --> 00:26:47,571
Not a permanent solution,
but it buys us some time.

474
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:50,757
BP's going up. He's stabilizing.

475
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,292
Magical.

476
00:26:54,563 --> 00:26:57,581
I think it's gonna be fine.

477
00:26:57,683 --> 00:27:00,634
I think those mats are
gonna be teeny tiny.

478
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,653
It's, uh, "mets," Mom. Mets.

479
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,890
- Mets. Like baseball?
- Yeah. Like baseball.

480
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,095
Good news. Great news.

481
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:15,248
The cancer's practically gone.

482
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:19,035
Looks like your psychic
was right, Mrs. Stevens.

483
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,121
Looks like we
caught it early after all.

484
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:25,792
Oh, thank you, God.
Thank you! Oh, my baby.

485
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:29,279
Jesus, Mary and
Joseph. Thank you!

486
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:32,415
Thank you! Thank you!

487
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:36,153
Thank you, thank you. Mm!

488
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,824
But I knew it. Didn't I?

489
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:45,061
I knew it. I knew.
Because you're my Cricket.

490
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,480
Nothing can happen to you.

491
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:53,203
- I love you, Mom.
- Oh, I love you, too,
my baby girl.

492
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:56,640
I love you so, so much.

493
00:28:02,364 --> 00:28:04,776
God, look at me,
I must be a mess.

494
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,034
I'm gonna go clean
up. And then, uh...

495
00:28:08,136 --> 00:28:10,937
And then I'm gonna
call Jade and Ms. Norris.

496
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,640
I got them all so worried.

500
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,938
The mets have shrunk some.

501
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,208
But there are new mets, too.

502
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:35,345
Several new mets.
In the small bowel.

503
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:38,182
- No surgery, then.
- Oh, I'm gonna operate.

504
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:41,085
I'm gonna take out
absolutely everything I can,

505
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:45,172
be as aggressive as I
can. We'll take it from there.

506
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,942
- OK.
- OK.

507
00:28:52,914 --> 00:28:55,777
You just have to give her
room. You two have history...

508
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:58,068
- I apologized.
- I know and it's loaded.

509
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:01,905
She keeps yelling at me that
I'm not her father. Well, I'm not.

510
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:05,875
I fell in love with her
mother. That's all I did.

511
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:08,345
Her mother never got
over you, and she...

512
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:10,380
That's not my
fault! I was young.

513
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:12,182
Lots of people have affairs.

514
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,201
They have affairs
and they don't...

515
00:29:14,303 --> 00:29:17,204
What Ellis did after
I left, that's on Ellis.

516
00:29:17,306 --> 00:29:19,572
And I'm trying to
run a hospital here.

517
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:23,059
- She's doing
the best she can.
- Her best isn't good enough.

518
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:27,414
If any other resident pulled
the crap she did today...?

519
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:30,000
She is still here because
of my history with you.

520
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,701
That's it. That's
the only reason.

521
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:34,616
Keep saying you're not her
father, but... Since we're talking...

522
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,991
You're the most professional
guy. The most level-headed.

523
00:29:38,093 --> 00:29:40,805
Except when it comes to
Meredith. You gave me hell.

524
00:29:40,829 --> 00:29:44,175
You weren't gonna give me Chief
because I was dating Meredith.

525
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:47,033
You told her about the ring,
sent her to bring me back.

526
00:29:47,135 --> 00:29:48,696
That's not running a hospital.

527
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,548
You paged her to try on dresses.

528
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:52,566
You paged her
today for Thatcher.

529
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:56,410
You have history with her. You
keep saying you're not her father.

530
00:29:56,512 --> 00:29:59,179
But the way you act,
you consider her family.

531
00:29:59,948 --> 00:30:01,681

537
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,035
I'm sorry for the way
I spoke to you earlier.

538
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:23,447
- Dr. Grey!
- Don't.

539
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:25,338
I know I was out of line.

540
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,591
I know I can't possibly imagine
what you've been through.

541
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:31,745
But I also know that this can
not be your daughter's story.

542
00:30:31,847 --> 00:30:35,682
That she shot her dad 17
times to protect her mom

543
00:30:35,784 --> 00:30:38,585
and you went back to him.

544
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:42,572
You have to change her story
while you still have a chance.

545
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,973
For both of you.

546
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:46,510
But for her, for
your little girl...

547
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:49,329
You have to change her story.

551
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:16,206
She lost a lot of blood,
but she's stable now.

552
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:23,213
They weighed the cost.

553
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,331
I'm sorry?

554
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:27,434
They weighed the
cost of killing her

555
00:31:27,536 --> 00:31:29,286
over letting her stay up there.

556
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:33,507
And then they got a bulldozer
and knocked her out of a tree.

557
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,844
They knocked my
baby sister out of a tree.

558
00:31:37,946 --> 00:31:39,846

00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:46,486
Hey, I'm here.

561
00:31:46,588 --> 00:31:49,639
I filed a lawsuit, against
Schuster and Werner,

562
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,324
a ten million dollar lawsuit.

563
00:31:51,426 --> 00:31:56,396
We're gonna make those
bastards pay for this, you hear me?

564
00:31:57,616 --> 00:31:59,633
I'm gonna make them pay.

565
00:31:59,735 --> 00:32:04,121
We can plant so many
trees with ten million dollars.

566
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:08,541
And when we win? The
check will be made out to Karen.

567
00:32:13,948 --> 00:32:16,348
My tree girl made it through?

568
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,304
I can't lie.

569
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:24,991
Even if they think I'm wrong,
even if they don't understand,

570
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:28,728
even if they think I'm crazy...

571
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:32,665
I'm me. They're
supposed to accept me.

572
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:37,103
They're supposed to support me.
They're supposed to love me, you know?

573
00:32:40,275 --> 00:32:42,025
I can't lie.

574
00:33:00,161 --> 00:33:01,895
Great.

575
00:33:01,997 --> 00:33:03,758
Is this another heart to heart?

576
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:05,532
I know you don't like me.

577
00:33:05,634 --> 00:33:08,301
You have every
right not to like me.

578
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,938
I have abused my power,
but now I'm here on your turf.

579
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,273
What I need to say...

580
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:17,861
What I need to say is, I saw
what your mother was doing.

581
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:21,764
I saw how neglected you were.
I saw her drive your father off.

582
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:24,835
I spent a lot of time
beating myself up about that.

583
00:33:24,937 --> 00:33:28,955
But what does that do
for you? Nothing. Nothing.

584
00:33:32,026 --> 00:33:35,562
I wasn't your advocate.

585
00:33:35,664 --> 00:33:40,049
I didn't fight for you. I
never stood up for you.

586
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:43,503
I let myself off the hook.

587
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:47,974
I told myself I was young and didn't
know better. But I did know better.

588
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:51,394
And I wasn't much
younger than you are now.

589
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,601
I should've fought
for you, Meredith,

590
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,502
like you fought
for that child today.

591
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:02,689
I told myself I
wasn't your father,

592
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,002
that it wasn't
my responsibility,

593
00:34:05,026 --> 00:34:07,171
that I was right not to butt in.

594
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:10,263
I let myself off the hook.

595
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:26,145
You were helpless.
You were a baby.

596
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:32,235
A beautiful, smart,
funny little girl.

597
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:38,024
And no one stood up for you.

598
00:34:43,264 --> 00:34:45,732
I'm so sorry.

599
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,587

600
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,163

- "Run to my truck?"

00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:34,023

You know what my truck

628

And that run saved a guy's life.

00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:41,664

O'Malley and ignored me.

Nice work, Yang." What is this?

636
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:16,799

We came up with them together.

637
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,186
They're three-word sentences,
so I'd have something to say

638
00:37:20,288 --> 00:37:22,722
instead of the three
words that are...

639
00:37:25,927 --> 00:37:29,712
that are killing me.

640
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:32,843
The three words that you
know I feel, but I can't say them,

641
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:38,637
because it would be cruel to say
them, because I am no good for you.

00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,807

don't want to look at you longingly

with you. So I'm smiling,

be able to follow us later.

661
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:54,530
So... We're here to say goodbye.

662
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:58,868
Say goodbye to Daddy. This is
the last you'll be seeing of him.

663
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,906
Bye, Daddy. Feel better.

664
00:39:12,633 --> 00:39:15,218
- Bye, Dr. Grey.

Sloan. Dr. Mark Sloan.

669

No. He's my...

Alex...

680
00:40:18,066 --> 00:40:21,267
But listen, the
shrimp kinda tastes...

681
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:24,453
sweet and spicy.
Like our first date.

682
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:28,041
The good part. The part before
I didn't kiss you on the porch.

683
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,842
OK. Nice.

684
00:40:29,944 --> 00:40:32,511
The chicken tastes like...

685
00:40:32,613 --> 00:40:36,415
a drive to the beach with the
windows down and the dog hanging out.

686
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:40,402
Like when you're a kid.
Salty... Tastes good. But...

687
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:42,922
I vote for the shrimp,
if we have to choose.

688
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:45,141
There's one more.

689
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:49,479
OK, yeah, that tastes like crap.

690
00:40:50,898 --> 00:40:54,400
OK, the OR's prepped
and ready. How about you?

691
00:40:54,502 --> 00:40:56,318
Yeah, I'm ready.

692
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:12,068

OK.

699
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:47,236
Packing up your mom's journals?

700
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,006
Yeah, there's nothing
in these for me.

701
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:52,887
I keep thinking... I don't
want to throw them away.

702
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:56,428

give them to the chief.

to the wedding.

704
