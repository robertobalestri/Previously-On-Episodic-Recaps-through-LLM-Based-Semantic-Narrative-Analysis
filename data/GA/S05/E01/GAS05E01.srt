1
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:11,210
<i>We all remember bedtime
stories of our childhoods.</i>

2
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:14,980
<i>The shoe fits Cinderella,
the frog turns into a prince,</i>

3
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:18,083
<i>Sleeping Beauty is
awakened with a kiss.</i>

4
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,818
<i>Once upon a time.</i>

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,754
<i>And then they lived
happily ever after.</i>

6
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:26,525
<i>Fairy tales. The
stuff of dreams.</i>

7
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:30,062
<i>The problem is, fairy
tales don't come true.</i>

8
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:34,900
<i>It's the other stories, the ones that
begin with dark and stormy nights,</i>

9
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:37,236
<i>and end in the unspeakable...</i>

10
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:40,939
<i>It's the nightmares that
always seem to become reality.</i>

11
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:49,230
What happened!?

12
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:51,328
A bus in front of him
hit a telephone pole.

13
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:53,313
- He tried to swerve
to miss it...
- How bad is it?

14
00:00:53,337 --> 00:00:55,771
You are gonna have to be strong.

15
00:00:57,274 --> 00:01:00,008
Derek!

16
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:06,498
No... No!

17
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,538
No! No!

18
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,807
Derek!

19
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:34,593
No!

20
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:38,797
No! Derek!

21
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,958
<i>The person that invented
the phrase "Happily ever after,"</i>

22
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,811
<i>should have his
ass kicked so hard.</i>

23
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,543
Back up, you're
sucking all my oxygen.

24
00:01:57,567 --> 00:01:59,701
- I'm trying to see.
- It's not up yet.

25
00:01:59,803 --> 00:02:02,454
- It supposed to be
posted at four.
- It's 4:15.

26
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:05,190
Hit the refresh button. You
have to reload the page.

27
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,592
I am hitting the button
every ten seconds.

28
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:08,721
- Is it up yet?
- No.

29
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:10,428
- Hi.
- Hi.

30
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,380
- Is it up yet?
- No. Wait.

31
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:15,479
Think we move up a slot. Pass
Hopkins, move to number one.

32
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:17,814
Not passing Hopkins.
We'll stay two.

33
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,537
Mayo could surge
ahead. We'd be three.

34
00:02:19,623 --> 00:02:21,806
- Three? Pessimist.
- Realist.

35
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:25,460
Rankings of teaching hospitals
change based on any number of things.

36
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,707
Three's top five. I
can live with three.

37
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:31,066
- Hit the refresh button.
- Stay back! I'm doing this.

38
00:02:31,168 --> 00:02:33,085
- Is it up yet?
- No!

39
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:36,371
- Here, hit the refresh...
- I am hitting the refresh...!

40
00:02:36,473 --> 00:02:39,675
OK, all of you, back up. Stop
hovering. Stop speculating.

41
00:02:39,777 --> 00:02:43,629
The rankings will go up when they go up.
We have no control when they are posted.

42
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,565
When it is up, I will say
it is! Until then, back up.

43
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,901
- Leave me alone so I can...
- It's up!

44
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,804
Number one, Hopkins.
Number two, Mayo...

45
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,206
Told you.

46
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:56,586
- Number three,
Cleveland Clinic.
- What?

47
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,510
- Number four, Mass Gen.
- What?

48
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,390
We moved down to five?!

49
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:03,582
No. We are not five.

50
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:06,401
- Twelve, O'Malley.
- It's so upsetting...

51
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:08,637
This is not a number
12 teaching hospital.

52
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:10,019
It's a great...

53
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:12,908
I do not run the number 12
surgical program. Out with it!

54
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,695
We've been downgraded from
Level One trauma center to Level Two.

55
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:19,031
What does that mean?

56
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:24,136
You don't need to
explain, it's just details...

57
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,057
Twelve.

58
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,193
I couldn't ask him about when
he's gonna schedule my test,

59
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,563
with all the you-know-what
hitting the fan.

60
00:03:34,665 --> 00:03:38,160
For all I know he's gonna spring
it to me, what, like, in an hour.

61
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:41,453
You'll be ready.
Causes of hypotension?

62
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:46,658
Uh, hypovolemia, MI,
cardiac dysrhythmia...

63
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,193
Uh...

64
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,230
- Hypoxia... Is that good?
- Very good.

65
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:52,847
Yeah? What?

66
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:58,453
The snow... it's so
pretty. It's like a fairy tale.

67
00:03:58,555 --> 00:04:02,207
Lexie, it's... it's the fall.

68
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:05,555
It's not so much a fairy
tale as global warming.

69
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,295
That's the Apocalypse.

70
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:10,398
It's like dropping to number 12.

71
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,018
And me failing my intern
test for the second time.

72
00:04:17,107 --> 00:04:21,509
I adore you, by
the way... Just...

73
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:23,845
Oh! Hey, sorry I'm
late. I was just helping...

74
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:25,891
No talking unless it's medical.

75
00:04:25,915 --> 00:04:28,450
So I keep having the dream.
The Derek is dead dream.

76
00:04:28,552 --> 00:04:31,018
Know who does residencies
at number 12 hospitals?

77
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,756
Losers. And I am not a
loser. Go get the charts.

78
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:38,476
So the dream is about me being
afraid of the house of candles,

79
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:42,147
taking the big step. And I'm
afraid of having a happy ending.

80
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,916
I have a PhD in biochem.
I am a double doctor.

81
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,937
Double doctors should not do
residencies at second rate hospitals.

82
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,218
Wyatt says I should just lean
into the wind. Into the fear.

83
00:04:52,242 --> 00:04:54,692
So I'm gonna ask
Derek to move in with me.

84
00:04:54,778 --> 00:04:57,929
I could transfer. Cleveland
Clinic has a huge cardio program.

85
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,199
- Still top 20. Pretty good.
- Pretty good is not enough.

86
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,234
I want to be great. Greatness.

87
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,265
Which is why I'm going to
ask Derek to move in with me.

88
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:10,192
Just that's it's a big step. Don't wanna
mess up, I've messed it up before...

89
00:05:10,294 --> 00:05:14,245
The break ups and the on and off
again, and the sleeping with George.

90
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:16,448
You slept with George?

91
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,201
No talking unless it's medical.

92
00:05:21,705 --> 00:05:24,372
So, I'm just gonna do it. I'm
gonna ask him to move in.

93
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:26,252
You think it's the right thing?

94
00:05:26,276 --> 00:05:29,477
Ugh. Bailey's paging.

95
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:36,251
Uh, so, medically, Meredith and
George had sexual intercourse?

96
00:05:36,353 --> 00:05:38,853
Uh, when? And how many times?

97
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:46,394
- It's humiliating. Twelve.
- Yeah.

98
00:05:46,496 --> 00:05:50,698
You're the best neurosurgeon
in the country. In the world.

99
00:05:52,236 --> 00:05:54,018
You wanna say anything about me?

100
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,199
You're the best plastics
guy at Seattle Grace.

101
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:59,741
- Nice. Really nice.
- Don't force me
to praise you.

102
00:06:01,411 --> 00:06:04,996
- Hey, Rose.
- Hello, Dr. Sloan.

103
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,282
Mm.

104
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:10,563
She took it well in the beginning,
hoping we could be civilized.

105
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:13,454
- She working my OR.
- Civilized is out. It's gone.

106
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:16,808
It's a trail of fairy dust.
Now she's got delayed rage.

107
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:19,393
- Delayed rage?
- She was being big
before.

108
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:22,080
Putting on a brave face.
She's had time to think.

109
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,732
She hates your guts. You
have to break up with her.

110
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:27,152
- I did.
- You did personally.

111
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:30,738
Now you have to do it
professionally. Good luck with that.

112
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,175
Delayed rage.

113
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,585
I'd like a list.

114
00:06:44,688 --> 00:06:47,989
From you of ways
that I can improve.

115
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:50,098
Not right now.

116
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:52,510
Richard, you told me
that I'm a bad teacher.

117
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:55,580
Now we're number 12, and
I don't like to be number 12,

118
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:58,283
- so I'd like a list.
- Not right now.

119
00:06:59,703 --> 00:07:02,203
But if there are ways
that I can improve,

120
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:05,217
ways that I can help the
program regain its ranking.

121
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:08,610
It's snowing. You know what
happens when it's nighttime,

122
00:07:08,712 --> 00:07:12,130
snowing and the temperature's
hovering right around 32 degrees?

123
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:14,115
- No.
- The snow begins to melt.

124
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:17,318
And then it freezes
again creating black ice.

125
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,055
The deadliest kind of ice,
because it is invisible to drivers.

126
00:07:21,157 --> 00:07:23,458
That'd usually mean
that our ER would fill up.

127
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,845
But Mercy West is a number one
level trauma center and we're not.

128
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,914
Their ER gets the traumas
while we get their castoffs.

129
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,566
Which pisses me off.

130
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:35,086
So when I say not right now,
what I mean is not right now.

131
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,244
Oh, um...

132
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,773
Stop shivering. You're
embarrassing me.

133
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,426
I didn't realize we
were gonna be outside.

134
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:01,830
I'm OK. You don't
have to do that.

135
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:03,442
Bundle up. You're turning blue.

136
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:06,467
- Dr. Bailey,
it is kinda cold...
- Someone will come.

137
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,854
- No one is coming.
- Maybe old people
with hips we can fix.

138
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,240
Stop talking. We are
Seattle Grace Hospital.

139
00:08:12,342 --> 00:08:16,027
Rankings or no rankings,
we are going to stand outside.

140
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,429
At the ready. On alert.

141
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:19,091
Give the best care available

142
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:21,416
to every patient that
arrives at our door.

143
00:08:21,518 --> 00:08:25,770
We may no longer be ranked the best,
but I'm the best. You are my residents.

144
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:29,090
Which means you're the best.
It's a matter of pride, people.

145
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:32,126
What are we doing?

146
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:33,861
- We're waiting.
- For?

147
00:08:33,963 --> 00:08:36,597
- A miracle.
- Someone will come.

148
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:39,951
- Mercy West is getting
traumas first...
- Someone'll come.

149
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:43,555
So we're here in the hopes
that someone is severely injured?

150
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:46,908
Wishing and praying that
someone is so hurt, so near death,

151
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,993
that the ambulance
has to bring 'em here

152
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,229
- 'cause we're closer
than Mercy.
- Yep.

153
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:54,498
Wow. You and God
are cool with that?

154
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,469
Damn it. I forgot about God.

155
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:01,305
All right, let's just
go on back inside...

156
00:09:07,697 --> 00:09:09,781
Go, go, go! Watch out!

157
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,272
- Are you OK?
- I drove a limousine
on ice!

158
00:09:17,374 --> 00:09:19,658
All by myself! Ten blocks!

159
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:25,296
You OK?

160
00:09:25,382 --> 00:09:27,710
My dress. There's
blood all over my dress.

161
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:31,001
- What happened?
- I got us to the hospital
in one piece.

162
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:34,022
Try not to move. Sit until
we can get you a wheelchair.

163
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:35,373
We need a wheelchair!

164
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:38,659
We're not the patients...
What's his name...?

165
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:40,478
- Benny... Billy.
- Billy?

166
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,648
Our limo driver. He flew
through the windshield.

167
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,468
Help him, please.

168
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:50,271
Uh, Yang, come around, help me.

169
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:53,574
Get a board, bring out
a gurney and a c-collar.

170
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:57,896
Wha...

171
00:09:59,316 --> 00:10:01,249
Wha...? Press it. Press.

172
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,942
- What do we have?
- Billy Matthews, 45.

173
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,978
Arterial bleed, haven't
isolated cause...

174
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,657
I got this. Get him
to Trauma One...

175
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:18,249
- Holding pressure
over the bleed...
- I've got this.

176
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:19,717
Wha...

177
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,272
What's going on?

178
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:27,876
Vincent will worry if I'm late.

179
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:29,711
You've been in a car accident.

180
00:10:29,813 --> 00:10:33,214
You're at the hospital. We're
going to take good care of you.

181
00:10:33,784 --> 00:10:35,283
Is she OK?

182
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,820
Might be a concussion. I'm gonna
order a CT to make sure it's nothing.

183
00:10:38,922 --> 00:10:41,956
All this blood. Should've
waited for the ambulance.

184
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,758
We did. They never came.

185
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,227
Billy was hanging
through the windshield.

186
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:50,531
You extracted your limo driver
from the windshield? By yourselves?

187
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:53,134
- Pretty heroic.
- Isn't Michael answering?

188
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:56,353
No. Try Phil again.

189
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:59,908
Shouldn't have even been going
to the stupid ball in a storm like that.

190
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:01,671
- What ball?
- Fire and Ice Ball.

191
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,335
Would you believe? In a storm?

192
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:07,198
Just goes to voicemail.
Maybe their phones are off.

193
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,151
- Can't reach Vincent?
- Husbands were
in another car?

194
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,619
We won't ride with them.

195
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:13,471
We're three happily
married women

196
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,723
except when our
husbands drag out cigars,

197
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:18,576
and they drag out
the cigars in the limo.

198
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,162
Your arm is not
broken, just bruised.

199
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:24,243
O'Malley is gonna suture
your cuts and you're all set.

200
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,600
You're lucky you didn't
sustain more injuries.

201
00:11:26,702 --> 00:11:29,887
- What doctor are you? You're young.
- I'm an intern.

202
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:35,025
Interns don't touch the face. The
plastic surgeon touches the face.

203
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,144
What's happening?

204
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,249
Where am I?

205
00:11:41,351 --> 00:11:44,652
We were in an accident.

206
00:11:44,754 --> 00:11:48,205
You're OK. We're
all going to be fine.

207
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,896
- Hi.
- Hi.

208
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:57,865
I've been really busy.

209
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,568
I know, I've been, like, crazy.

210
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,982
Researching things.
A lot of research.

211
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:05,006
- In the library.
- Oh, yeah? Me too.

212
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:10,578
Incredibly busy. Lot of research.
Like you. Only I use the Internet.

213
00:12:12,282 --> 00:12:14,715
- I've got to check in
with Bailey.
- Me too.

214
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,685
- Bailey, anything else?
- Nothing. Nothing else.

215
00:12:17,787 --> 00:12:19,937
That's the problem.
I'm charting.

216
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:24,391
The chief took my one trauma, I
gave up my clinic and now I'm charting.

217
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,778
Chief wanted you to
take a look at these.

218
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,783
Billy Matthews, limo driver,
multiple crush injuries from the MVC.

219
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,868
Hemopericardium.

220
00:12:35,772 --> 00:12:40,341
Hemopericardium can lead to cardiac
tamponade which can be detected by

221
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:47,431
Beck's triad: increased JVP,
hypotension, and muffled heart sounds.

222
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:51,002
This is a teaching hospital. I'm
trying to improve my teaching.

223
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,104
Don't try it on me.

224
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:53,854
- Wanna know how I teach?
- No.

225
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:57,741
I'm like a guru. They come to
me for help and I gently guide them

226
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:00,995
along the path to
truth and wisdom.

227
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:03,442
Hey, George. I heard a thing.

228
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:06,712
A surprising thing. A very
unexpected non-medical thing.

229
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:08,416
- About you and...
- Hold on...

230
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:12,273
Dr. Sloan, hi. Sarabeth
Briar's got a facial lac,

231
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,927
- but she will only
let you touch her.
- You paged me for a cut?

232
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,545
What kind of moron are you,

233
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:22,583
are you a special moron from the
Isle of Complete and Utter Morons?

234
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:24,351
- I don't...
- Shut up.

235
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,487
Truth and wisdom.

236
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,992
He's an ass.

237
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,645
This is what we
get for being 12.

238
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:42,970
A bunch of women in ball
gowns and a half-dead limo driver.

239
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,206
Those women are
amazing, tried to save his life.

240
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:47,319
- That's who I wanna be.
- An aging princess?

241
00:13:47,343 --> 00:13:50,477
They've been with the same
men for years and they're happy.

242
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,380
They did it. I could do it.

243
00:13:52,482 --> 00:13:54,098
- Mer...
- Hey.

244
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:55,950
Who paged me?

245
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,837
Bailey and Izzie paged
you. You should see Bailey.

246
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:03,190
- She's got the limo driver.
- OK.

247
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:05,610
- Wanna move in with me?
- Wanna live together?

248
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:09,263
- Well, I mean,
I could... I just...
- Yes.

249
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:10,809
- Yes?
- You sure you're ready?

250
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,817
I'm leaning into the fear
to get a happy ending.

251
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,553
I don't even know
what that means.

252
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,388
Damn it!

253
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,424
Time of death, 20:47.

254
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,667
Limo driver, traumatic arrest.

255
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,536
Never regained a pulse.

256
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:34,505
Tell them not to book the OR.

257
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,629
- I have a dream, Yang.
- Excuse me?

258
00:14:41,731 --> 00:14:46,133
That one day, a trauma will
come through those doors.

259
00:14:46,235 --> 00:14:47,651
I have a dream.

260
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:52,356
- I share that dream.
- Number 12.

261
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,475
Number 12.

262
00:14:54,577 --> 00:14:58,513
Right now dispatch is
squawking about three men. Three.

263
00:14:58,615 --> 00:15:02,867
Serious injuries every one.
They're taking them to Mercy West.

264
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,619
- Three men?
- That's what I said.

265
00:15:05,722 --> 00:15:09,824
Three men who could be married
to those ladies in ball gowns?

266
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:13,160
- Little stick.
- Squeeze my hand, squeeze my hand.

267
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:16,663
- Just like when
you had Pete, remember?
- Ugh! Pete hurt less.

268
00:15:16,765 --> 00:15:19,933
You're gonna love me later
when there's virtually no scar.

269
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:23,905
Ladies, um, I've been on the
phone with ambulance dispatch.

270
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:28,559
Three gentlemen in a limo collided
with another vehicle on Broad Street.

271
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,981
- Possible it was
your husbands.
- Oh, no.

272
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,681
- Taking them to Mercy West.
- Across town.

273
00:15:33,783 --> 00:15:36,701
Unless you prefer that
they be brought here.

274
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:39,386
- We can do that?
- Oh! You can insist.

275
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:41,288
If I were you, I would insist.

276
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,976
Oh. Then, I guess...
I guess we insist.

277
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:48,062
- Yes, we insist.
- You insist.

278
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,888
Am I to understand that you stole
these traumas from Mercy West?

279
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,557
- No idea what
you are talking about.
- Good job. It's personal.

280
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,660
Yang, come with me.

281
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:06,630
We got a situation.

282
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,933
Fifty-eight-year-old male, MVC.

283
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:13,987
Tacking 160. VP, 80 palp.
Decrease bilateral and breath sounds.

284
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,089
- What did you do?
- I didn't. He did.

285
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:19,076
GI Joe trached him in
the field before I got there.

286
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,407
With a pen?! You
trached with an ink pen?

287
00:16:21,431 --> 00:16:23,030
So?

288
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:28,018
Move this guy inside. Now! Let's
go. Move, move, move, move.

289
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,354
Pen Trach?

290
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,492
Hot.

291
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,149
OK, what do we got?

292
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,785
Vincent Kenner, 58,
unrestrained passenger

293
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:48,723
of a limo that took a nosedive. Muffled
heart sounds and a large scalp lac.

294
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:50,425
- Vincent!
- Betty...

295
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:52,443
I'm sorry, Dr. Hahn, but she...

296
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,629
That's my husband. What
happened? Is he all right?

297
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:58,315
I promise to give you an
update as soon as we know,

298
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:00,317
but right now I have
to get you to a CT.

299
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,353
- Vincent!
- I'll bring you back.

300
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:05,440
- Free fluid in the abdomen.
- Depressed skull fracture.

301
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:07,675
Decreased breath
sounds, bilaterally.

302
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,005
Guy's getting an
express ticket to the OR.

303
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,949
- Let the chief know.
- Can I scrub in?

304
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:13,130
Fine.

305
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,683
He has a pen in his throat!

306
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:19,453
Michael! Oh, God,
Michael! Are you...

307
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:23,408
Is that a pen in his throat? Does
he have a ballpoint pen in his throat?

308
00:17:23,493 --> 00:17:25,893
- Let the doctors work.
- They have to be careful.

309
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:29,146
Michael's been under stress,
and the last thing he needs...

310
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,948
Can you handle this woman?

311
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:33,233
We're gonna take you to your
husband, around the corner.

312
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:36,203
Sweetheart, I'm here.
Michael, I'm here.

313
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,724
- This is not her husband?
- Nope.

314
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,444
- Oh, my God, Michael!
- It's her husband.

315
00:17:43,546 --> 00:17:45,396
- What happened to him?
- Come with me.

316
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,418
- What happened to him?
- Please, please.

317
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,669
You trached a man in the
field using a ballpoint pen?

318
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,020
It was all I had on me.

319
00:17:53,122 --> 00:17:56,290
What? It's not like I didn't
clean it off with fresh snow.

320
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:57,774
It's awesome.

321
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,478
Really? You're going with
a size 6 shiley tube on that?

322
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,095
Get this guy away from me.

323
00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:07,318
I'm gonna need a CT of his belly,
chief. Karev, get us some line.

324
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,188
His trachea's crushed. Going to need
an OR and hands. Who's available?

325
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,517
- Grey.
- The good Grey?

326
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,692
- The intern Grey.
- And I'll throw in O'Malley.

327
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:18,278
Oh. Nice. Perfect.

328
00:18:19,282 --> 00:18:23,417
Phil? Oh, my God. Oh,
my God. What happened?

329
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:30,090
The limo hit a patch of
ice. Next thing I know,

330
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,077
we're all upside down
and we're rolling and...

331
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,048
- Anna, I can't feel my legs.
- Oh, my God.

332
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,601
Oh, Phil, I'm so sorry.

333
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,971
OK, get her out. I gotta
get a consult from Shepherd.

334
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:52,380
Oh. Sir, Dr. Hahn's working
on multiple crush injuries.

335
00:18:52,482 --> 00:18:56,467
- Wants you to take a look.
- On my way. You're bleeding.

336
00:18:56,569 --> 00:19:01,272
My car was right behind theirs at
the intersection. I cut it on impact.

337
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,090
And you triaged these men?

338
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:07,011
Major Owen Hunt. US Army Second
Forward Surgical. I'm a trauma surgeon.

339
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:12,416
- Just got home on leave.
- Yang, take care
of Major Hunt's leg.

340
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,584
Sir... I'm scrubbing
in with you...

341
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,687
After you take
care of Major Hunt.

342
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:21,576
- Where are you going?
- To check on my
other patients.

343
00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:22,860
No. You are the patient.

344
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:25,378
Hello? Vincent?

345
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:28,415
Are you there? Where am I?

346
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:32,837
You've been in a car accident, Betty.
You're having a CT. It's gonna be OK.

347
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,771
Everything is OK. Don't move.

348
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,919
Some nutjob trached
a guy with a pen.

349
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:39,092
- Pretty cool.
- Want cool? Check this out.

350
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:41,845
- Every 30 seconds.
- Is someone there?

351
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,013
Where am I?

352
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,299
You've been in a
car accident, Betty.

353
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:47,635
You're having a CT. It's OK.

354
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:52,205
Every 30 seconds her memory
resets. Every 30 seconds.

355
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:56,310
Might not be bad. Like hitting the
refresh button, everything's new.

356
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:57,978
How you doing?

357
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,315
You keep asking me that
and I keep telling you I'm fine.

358
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:02,883
I know, it's just...

359
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:05,635
Sometimes I think Denny's
right around the corner,

360
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,383
and he's been dead a long time.

361
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:10,324
It just takes a
while to get used to.

362
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:12,926
Rebecca didn't die.
It's not like that for me.

363
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:15,663
I'm good. But
thank you for asking.

364
00:20:15,765 --> 00:20:17,981
Hello? Is someone there?

365
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:20,083
Where am I?

366
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:23,554
You're in a spaceship, you're
going to the Moon. Enjoy the ride.

367
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,556
Alex.

368
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:30,677
A spaceship? Excuse me?

369
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,313
You're having a CT,
Betty. You're gonna be OK.

370
00:20:33,415 --> 00:20:35,961
You've been in a car
accident. Just don't move.

371
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:40,003
- Thanks a lot.
- Bailey paged me. See you later.

372
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,007
He has a depressed
skull fracture.

373
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,143
I could elevate
the skull fragments,

374
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:49,179
but there's no telling how
much damage has been done.

375
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:52,365
- We're saving this man.
- We're looking
at an aortic tear.

376
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:54,184
Not to mention vast
amounts of blood

377
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:57,037
- in his abdomen...
- I can handle the bleeding.

378
00:20:57,139 --> 00:20:59,859
- He is circling the drain.
- I have other traumas.

379
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,425
We're saving this man.

380
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:05,997
Does everyone understand
or do I have to repeat myself?

381
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,292
- Yes.
- Understood.

382
00:21:07,316 --> 00:21:09,850
Book OR Two.

383
00:21:12,588 --> 00:21:17,257
I know it's overwhelming, but
Phil couldn't be in better hands.

384
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,626
It's not just Phil.

385
00:21:19,728 --> 00:21:21,995
It's also Michael.

386
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,508
But you already knew that.

387
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,868
I didn't know for sure...

388
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,520
It's pathetic, isn't it?

389
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:33,224
A married woman cheats on
her best friend with her husband.

390
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:37,311
You can't go much
lower than that.

391
00:21:37,413 --> 00:21:39,497
These things happen.

392
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:41,610
I ran into Michael in the mall.

393
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:46,971
We had lunch, then a week
later we had another lunch.

394
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:51,742
And, here we are,
eight months later.

395
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:54,161
And Sarabeth has no idea.

396
00:21:54,263 --> 00:21:58,783
When you... When you spend your life
with someone and you have kids together

397
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:01,719
you think it'll always be
this amazing and wonderful.

398
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,922
You think that you'll
always feel that kind of love.

399
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:09,476
And I do. I do love Phil.

400
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,812
I just...

401
00:22:14,683 --> 00:22:16,300
Just what?

402
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:23,040
Well, little pieces of
you get chipped away.

403
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:28,829
By another person. And then you
shave little pieces of yourself away.

404
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,064
So that you'll fit together.

405
00:22:32,335 --> 00:22:34,268
And one day you look up,

406
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,671
and you don't even
know who you are.

407
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:40,885
I better get back to my husband.

408
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:43,977
- He'll be wondering
where I am.
- OK.

409
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:50,717
- That graft is
actually holding.
- I am impressing even myself.

410
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,337
- Shep?
- Mm. Almost there.

411
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:56,806
Everybody, take a look
at the monitor, please.

412
00:22:56,892 --> 00:23:00,494
Now, to elevate the last
of the skull fragments,

413
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:03,580
I'll need a large, flat
instrument to get under the bone.

414
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:06,933
Uh, curved number two penfield.

415
00:23:07,036 --> 00:23:10,270
You know what, I want
a number four penfield.

416
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:14,708
Interesting. Why do you want to
use the number four penfield instead?

417
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,811
Sorry?

418
00:23:16,913 --> 00:23:20,547
Oh. How would you explain it?
I'm observing your teaching style.

419
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,867
- Hope you don't mind.
- Yeah, OK.

420
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,219
So the penfield? You
changed it because?

421
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,689
I changed my mind.

422
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,340
Is there a problem, Rose?

423
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:33,894
Not at all, Dr. Shepherd.
You changed your mind. Got it.

424
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:36,046
Huh.

425
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:42,502
Dr. Shepherd? I've got a guy
with a high level spinal injury.

426
00:23:42,604 --> 00:23:45,739
I've started him on steroids, but
he needs to be decompressed.

427
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,676
- You almost done?
- Yeah. I'm done right now.

428
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,495
Close up for me?

429
00:23:56,252 --> 00:24:00,287
So... we consider him
a good teacher, right?

430
00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:01,955
I'm just checking.

431
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:08,140
The spine is crushed from
C6 to T1, impinging on the cord.

432
00:24:08,164 --> 00:24:11,415
We need to relieve the
pressure on the spinal cord.

433
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:14,534
- But with these injuries...
- People don't walk again.

434
00:24:14,636 --> 00:24:19,239
- Phil. You don't know that.
- Anna, sweetheart, it's OK.

435
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:20,919
You have to do something.

436
00:24:20,943 --> 00:24:22,559
Phil's very strong.

437
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:26,196
He has grandkids. You
have to do something.

438
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,632
- You could freeze him.
- Shouldn't be in here.

439
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:31,684
If you want him to have
a shot at walking again.

440
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,324
Who the hell are you?

441
00:24:37,426 --> 00:24:41,411
Army Surgeon Badass did something
crazy with a pen on a guy's throat.

442
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:44,748
Appreciate it if you didn't give
my patient and wife false hope.

443
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,902
Until you exhaust options,
it's not false. It's hope.

444
00:24:48,004 --> 00:24:50,282
You should keep
current on your research.

445
00:24:50,306 --> 00:24:53,140
They did make a football
player walk at Buffalo Gen

446
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,109
using therapeutic hypothermia.

447
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:58,478
Buffalo's patient was 20 years
old, in prime cardiac fitness.

448
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,598
My patient is in his 60s
and is a very risky candidate.

449
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,301
I'd prefer he live to see
his grandkids. Book an OR.

450
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:08,438
Tell this patient this is not an option,
despite Uncle Sam's assessment.

451
00:25:10,325 --> 00:25:12,176
We're closing up your leg now.

452
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,661
Michael can live after
they put a pen in his throat?

453
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:33,347
The emergency trach
helped him breathe.

454
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,549
Dr. Sloan needs to
get him to the OR...

455
00:25:35,651 --> 00:25:37,884
Surgery? He needs surgery?

456
00:25:37,986 --> 00:25:41,337
When your husband was
pinned underneath the car

457
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,807
he suffered a laceration
to his windpipe,

458
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,577
which Dr. Sloan needs to
fix to stabilize his airway.

459
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:52,466
He also has some bruising around
his kidney and a lac on his liver.

460
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:54,479
Will he need surgery for that?

461
00:25:54,503 --> 00:25:58,571
There's a chance the
abdominal injuries will heal,

462
00:25:58,673 --> 00:26:01,808
but if they get worse,
yes, he will need surgery.

463
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:05,612
Two surgeries? I can't
believe this is happening.

464
00:26:05,714 --> 00:26:08,599
- Hold on, this is today?
- Tonight. At midnight.

465
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:11,652
- Ma'am, there's
one other matter.
- More? There's more?

466
00:26:11,754 --> 00:26:14,705
According to billing, your
insurance expires at midnight.

467
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:18,825
We're gonna treat you, of course,
but to make it easier on you later,

468
00:26:18,927 --> 00:26:21,478
is there another card,
or insurance policy?

469
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,065
My husband, he takes
care of these things.

470
00:26:26,735 --> 00:26:28,285
OK.

471
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:35,158
OK.

472
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:44,618
I'm going to numb... Wow!

473
00:26:45,454 --> 00:26:47,888
- Uh, you're not numbed.
- So?

474
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:51,825
So... Ow! Ow!

475
00:26:56,231 --> 00:26:58,711
Can't get an angle
on these. Could you?

476
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:04,688
OK...

477
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:18,735
Thank you.

478
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,373
Don't mention it.

479
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,693
- Can I ask you something?
- Uh... What?

480
00:27:26,795 --> 00:27:29,363
Um, him, actually.

481
00:27:29,465 --> 00:27:34,468
Oh. Sure. I've got surgery.
And... poke yourself.

482
00:27:39,608 --> 00:27:42,392
Talk to me about
the freezing thing.

483
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,663
Betty Kenner, closed head
injury from the limo wreck.

484
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,726
Subdural hematoma.

485
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,383
- Why she has memory loss.
- Yep.

486
00:27:50,486 --> 00:27:53,164
Might ease up once we
relieve pressure. Book an OR.

487
00:27:53,188 --> 00:27:55,700
I'll go in on her after I
finish Anna's husband.

488
00:27:55,724 --> 00:27:56,756
Busy OR today.

489
00:27:56,858 --> 00:27:58,642
That's kinda your thing, right?

490
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:01,328
Juggling more than
one person at a time?

491
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:10,320
- Hey, how's Betty's husband?
- I'm scrubbing in on him now.

492
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,691
Shepherd did what he could,
but the chief and Hahn are working.

493
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:15,159
He's an ugly mess.

494
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,295
Sarabeth's husband may need
another surgery once Derek's done.

495
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:19,397
These poor women.

496
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:20,864
Anna, the one with cuts,

497
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:22,844
is married to the
guy on Derek's table.

498
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,285
And she is sleeping
with Sarabeth's husband.

499
00:28:25,387 --> 00:28:27,420
- The one Sloan's working on.
- Kidding?

500
00:28:27,522 --> 00:28:30,168
- No, don't tell Betty.
- She wouldn't remember
if I did.

501
00:28:30,192 --> 00:28:33,961
That happens? Married 40 years,
then become a big, fat, lying cheater?

502
00:28:34,063 --> 00:28:37,564
If 40 years doesn't make you
committed, what does? What's the point?

503
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:40,346
- What if I move in
with Derek...
- Give you 100 bucks

504
00:28:40,436 --> 00:28:42,397
if you talk about
something else.

505
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:45,606
It's not about the years, it's about
the man. Derek's a good man.

506
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:48,992
- I'm out of here.
- There are a lot
of really good men.

507
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:51,745
George is a really
good guy. I mean...

508
00:28:52,514 --> 00:28:54,614
Nope, Sloan's not.

509
00:28:54,716 --> 00:29:00,003
Alex. Yeah. Alex has
turned into a very good man.

510
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,673
- You and Alex...?
- No!

511
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:06,443
I'm making a point.

512
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:09,580
But it is nice
that we're friends.

513
00:29:09,682 --> 00:29:13,633
He's changed. He's
actually opening up to me.

514
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:16,085
You think if you moved
in and got married,

515
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:19,673
in 40 years, you'd feel dead
inside? Enough to cheat on him?

516
00:29:20,775 --> 00:29:21,941
Wow.

517
00:29:22,044 --> 00:29:24,861
Yang, Major Hunt
all taken care of?

518
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,674
I did my best, sir.

519
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,899
Put pressure on
this bleeder for me.

520
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:32,769
You know what I think? I think the
number 12 ranking was a mistake.

521
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,171
A clerical error.

522
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,339
I'm gonna start
making calls about it

523
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,391
as soon as I get
out of this surgery.

524
00:29:38,493 --> 00:29:41,745
So, I've been observing
teaching styles.

525
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:44,848
Shepherd likes to teach
by thinking out loud,

526
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:50,003
Bailey is blunt and direct and
doesn't overteach, and Sloan...

527
00:29:50,105 --> 00:29:52,606
Well, Sloan just likes
to berate and humiliate.

528
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,325
If you really wanna
learn about teaching,

529
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:59,462
you should talk to your students.
Find out how they learn best.

530
00:30:00,115 --> 00:30:01,381
Yang?

531
00:30:02,451 --> 00:30:04,562
That's not necessary, sir...

532
00:30:04,586 --> 00:30:06,503
Are you serious
or not, Dr. Hahn?

533
00:30:07,623 --> 00:30:09,206
Fine.

534
00:30:12,127 --> 00:30:13,359
Go.

535
00:30:15,464 --> 00:30:17,330
For me, personally,

536
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:20,967
I learn better when I'm asked
questions, the Socratic method.

537
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,787
That's the cornerstone of medical
teaching. It's what we do in rounds.

538
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:28,091
Not everyone does it. Some
people simply tell you what to do.

539
00:30:28,176 --> 00:30:30,544
Who? Are you talking about me?

540
00:30:30,646 --> 00:30:32,296
It's OK, Dr. Yang.

541
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:35,882
Dr. Hahn is eager to
learn. You can be honest.

542
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,405
He's crashing. Get
me an aortic clamp.

543
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,524
I can't get a handle
on this bleeding.

544
00:30:44,626 --> 00:30:47,394
We may have to start
doing damage control soon.

545
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:57,054
I see a tear in
the renal artery.

546
00:30:57,156 --> 00:30:59,690
You familiar with single
layer continuous closure?

547
00:30:59,792 --> 00:31:01,808
- Of course.
- BP's still dropping.

548
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,310
Max out on levophed,
keep pushing the blood.

549
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,614
Get in there and stitch, Yang.

550
00:31:09,885 --> 00:31:12,096
There's a problem
with the insurance.

551
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,771
As we explained, he
can't talk right now.

552
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,757
I know but, Michael,
I called them.

553
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:21,110
And the credit card
company. And they said that...

554
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:24,359
The cards have been cancelled.

555
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:28,535
I... I don't understand.

556
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,488
I just need to know what to do.

557
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,358
I don't know what to do.

558
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,494
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but we
need to get him to Dr. Sloan now.

559
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,831
Is there something I can do?

560
00:32:00,202 --> 00:32:03,236
Someone I can call? I...

561
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:05,838
I don't...

562
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,208
I don't handle the money, but...

563
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:13,113
If you can just
tell me who to call.

564
00:32:15,283 --> 00:32:18,218
I'll talk to billing,
see what I can do.

565
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:22,606
Thank you.

566
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:35,936
It's stuck. Can't seem to
get it down the left bronchis.

567
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:40,023
- You almost got it, George.
- What are you,
his little cheerleader?

568
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,276
Step aside, wonder boy,
before you make things worse.

569
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,795
O'Malley, go find
out if the OR's ready.

570
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,797
If you can manage that.

571
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:55,866
You're a little mean to
George. Unnecessarily mean.

572
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,359
He's studying to retake his
intern test, so he's stressed out.

573
00:32:59,461 --> 00:33:02,696
So I was just thinking
maybe you could be nicer.

574
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:05,231
You're an intern. Why
are you talking to me?

575
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:11,805
You're... You're my half sister's
boyfriend's best friend. So I...

576
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,840
You thought that
makes us friends?

577
00:33:13,942 --> 00:33:16,859
Thought you'd defend your
boyfriend to me and I'd take it?

578
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:19,962
- He's not my boyfriend.
- But you want him to be.

579
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:21,576
- Do not.
- Do too.

580
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,733
- Do not.
- Do too. Does he know?

581
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,602
- Shut up.
- I'm your attending.

582
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:28,404
Can't tell me to shut up. Want
me to be nicer to O'Malley?

583
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,140
- Please?
- Confess your love,

584
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:33,526
- I'll think about it.
- Shut up.

585
00:33:33,628 --> 00:33:36,028
<i>Dr. Leone, call the blood bank.</i>

586
00:33:37,566 --> 00:33:40,667
- Know anything
about health insurance?
- No. Why?

587
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,902
Trying to help out a patient.

588
00:33:43,004 --> 00:33:46,589
The softer side of
Alex. Izzie was right.

589
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:50,560
- What's that supposed
to mean?
- Nothing.

590
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:52,145
What did Izzie say to you?

591
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:55,292
She said you were a good man.

592
00:33:55,316 --> 00:33:59,269
She said you'd
changed. It was nothing.

593
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:02,572
Did she say that I cried?
Because that is a lie.

594
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:05,409
- She didn't say that.
- Should keep
her mouth shut.

595
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:08,662
Alex, I made a stupid joke.
She didn't mean anything.

596
00:34:11,432 --> 00:34:12,999
Yang, how you doing?

597
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:16,085
It's, um... I can't
get it, it's not holding.

598
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,622
- It's tearing.
- Damn it. Move.

599
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,724
I thought you said
you've done the stitch.

600
00:34:20,826 --> 00:34:22,959
- I have! A hundred times.
- On hearts.

601
00:34:23,044 --> 00:34:24,210
On hearts.

602
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:26,441
Your forceps were
macerating the tissue.

603
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:28,443
You were handling
the bowel incorrectly.

604
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:32,902
Which you would know if you weren't
allowed to clock so many hours in

605
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:37,524
cardiothoracics at the expense of
your general surgery knowledge.

606
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:48,585
Crap. His vocal cords are
damaged beyond repair.

607
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:51,354
- Is there anything we can do?
- Probably won't talk again.

608
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:54,407
- I think that question
was for me.
- Sorry.

609
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:58,261
You get to take your intern test again,
think that makes you big man on campus?

610
00:34:58,363 --> 00:35:00,480
Doesn't change the fact
you failed the first time.

611
00:35:00,582 --> 00:35:02,582
- Dr. Sloan.
- I'm sorry, Grey.

612
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:05,117
Was there something you
wanted to say to anyone?

613
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:06,219
No. There wasn't.

614
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,864
- Coward.
- Shut up.

615
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:09,856
Lexie!

616
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:11,157
Pressure's dropping.

617
00:35:11,259 --> 00:35:13,927
It looks like defib.

618
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,729
- Twenty joules.
- Clear!

619
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:24,153
Hang another unit of packed
cells. As many as it takes.

620
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:28,157
Somebody go get some
FFP! Suction, please. Suction!

621
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:32,295
I got it. This is too much
blood, too much blood...

622
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:35,231
We're losing him.

623
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,485
What's going on?

624
00:35:39,588 --> 00:35:41,354
Am I in a hospital?

625
00:35:41,456 --> 00:35:46,259
There was an accident,
but you're going to be fine.

626
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:51,631
<i>♪ No history ♪</i>

627
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:54,500
<i>♪ No trace of you ♪</i>

628
00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:58,321
We're all going to be fine.

629
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:01,007
<i>♪ It's been wiped clean ♪</i>

630
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:03,926
<i>♪ No history ♪</i>

631
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:09,349
<i>♪ No trace of you or me ♪</i>

632
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:17,957
Yeah... Um...

633
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:21,178
I was able to repair
your husband's vertebrae,

634
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,230
and relieve the pressure
from his spine, but, uh...

635
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:28,785
- He's still paralyzed?
- Yes, I'm sorry.

636
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:32,005
Oh, God... Oh, Phil.

637
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,891
And Michael? What about Michael?

638
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:40,246
I repaired his trachea, but
unfortunately, his vocal cords

639
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:42,481
were completely
severed in the accident.

640
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:46,585
He can't talk? He'll
never be able to talk?

641
00:36:46,688 --> 00:36:48,588
We have to be strong.

642
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:54,410
We have to be strong
for Phil and for Michael.

643
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:57,947
I'll be ready for Betty in OR
One when you're done here.

644
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:04,804
- Um...
- Is it Vincent? What's happened?

645
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:07,357
- Please.
- Came through surgery.

646
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:09,342
He's stable, but still critical.

647
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:12,295
- Oh, my God.
- This is Dr. Yang.

648
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,149
She is going to be
responsible for seeing to it

649
00:37:16,251 --> 00:37:18,852
that your husband
makes it through the night.

650
00:37:18,954 --> 00:37:20,120
I'm...

651
00:37:22,024 --> 00:37:23,790
I will keep you posted.

652
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:28,645
Keep me posted... about what?

653
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:33,432
Where am I? Where's Vincent?

654
00:37:33,534 --> 00:37:37,387
She has a subdural hematoma.
Her memory resets every 30 seconds.

655
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,407
Perfect.

656
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:51,501
Rose...

657
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,271
Please look at me.

658
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:58,808
If you're gonna behave like
this, you can't be in my OR.

659
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:05,982
OK, there's no good
way to say this...

660
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:09,886
I've been acting this
way because I'm...

661
00:38:11,472 --> 00:38:13,639
I'm carrying your child, Derek.

662
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:19,895
Ha! Gotcha.

663
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:26,703
- This is your idea of a joke?
- Oh, please, you deserve it.

664
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,171
Who do you think you are?

665
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:31,490
"If you're gonna keep behaving
this way, you can't be in my OR."

666
00:38:31,592 --> 00:38:34,660
You should transfer
to a different specialty.

667
00:38:34,762 --> 00:38:37,663
You should transfer
to a different specialty.

668
00:38:38,967 --> 00:38:42,284
- I'm a neurosurgeon.
- You should've thought
of that

669
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:45,404
while repeatedly assuring
me that you were over your ex.

670
00:38:45,506 --> 00:38:49,075
See you in the OR.
I'm not going anywhere.

671
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,783
Chief, about Phillip Loomis?

672
00:38:57,885 --> 00:38:59,802
Shepherd's spinal patient?

673
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:05,258
I was thinking, what about
therapeutic hypothermia?

674
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,711
You want to freeze
a spinal injury?

675
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:12,682
They did it in Buffalo, and
Mass Gen had success with it too.

676
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:17,554
- And Major Hunt,
he swears by it.
- What does Shepherd think?

677
00:39:17,656 --> 00:39:20,723
He thinks it's too risky
in Mr. Loomis' case.

678
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:25,544
- He's not as fit, he's older...
- Loomis isn't
much older than me.

679
00:39:27,248 --> 00:39:31,684
I can do the procedure,
chief, I just need your OK.

680
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:35,188
- What were you doing
back there?
- I was trying to help you.

681
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,691
Telling an attending to shut
up in his OR? That's not helping.

682
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:41,978
What makes you think you
can...? You're sleeping with him?

683
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,913
- What? No!
- Yes, you are!

684
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:45,776
Why would you say that? Jealous?

685
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,280
Of the fact that you can
tell Sloan to shut up? Yeah.

686
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:52,755
You know, he's right. I'm
the hospital joke, it's my fault.

687
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:55,325
I'm the one who
failed my intern exam,

688
00:39:55,427 --> 00:39:58,628
and got married in Vegas
and cheated on my wife.

689
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,097
You don't understand.
The only reason he was...

690
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,999
Doesn't matter, I can
take care of myself.

691
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:09,372
He's got fishing gear and
boots and hair products.

692
00:40:09,474 --> 00:40:13,109
I don't have room for that stuff.
He talks. And not a little. He chats.

693
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:15,778
- He's chatty freaking Cathy.
- Not right now.

694
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,998
You know what's gonna happen
after he moves in, don't you?

695
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,568
We build a house on his land,
our land, because we'll be married.

696
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:26,289
And then I'll be
Dr. Mrs. Shepherd.

697
00:40:27,976 --> 00:40:32,077
And you know what comes after
that? Babies. There'll be his babies.

698
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:35,164
So they'll have perfect
hair, and they'll be chatty.

699
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,883
I'll have five chatty
children, a chatty husband

700
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:42,021
and live in a house in the wilderness.
Then start sleeping with your husband.

701
00:40:42,123 --> 00:40:44,840
Gotta tell him I changed
my mind, don't you think?

702
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,776
- Meredith!
- It's...

703
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:47,927
What?

704
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:52,932
- Why are you making that face?
- Shut up!

705
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:56,468
Just shut up about Derek. Shut
up about moving in with Derek.

706
00:40:56,571 --> 00:41:00,122
Shut up about your relationship!
Because I've heard it all before.

707
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:02,741
You guys get together,
I have to listen to it.

708
00:41:02,843 --> 00:41:05,511
You break up, I
have to listen to it.

709
00:41:05,613 --> 00:41:09,415
I almost killed a
man in surgery today.

710
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:12,885
OK, you wanna know what I
think? OK, you really wanna know?

711
00:41:12,987 --> 00:41:15,187
You and Derek will not work.

712
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:18,808
Moving in together is a
mistake of massive proportions.

713
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:23,579
You are dreaming of dead Derek,
which should tell you it will not work.

714
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:27,650
- Cristina...
- No. This "happily ever after?"

715
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:29,185
Does not exist.

716
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:33,389
So please, please, please,
as you weigh your options here,

717
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,842
just consider the possibility
of shutting the hell up.

718
00:41:36,944 --> 00:41:39,111
Because I can't
listen to it anymore.

719
00:41:39,213 --> 00:41:40,474
- I...
- No!

720
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,642
- OK.
- No!

721
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,016
- I...
- That's it, that's it. I'm done.

722
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:48,520
Ah! Oh! Ow! Ow!

723
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:54,660
I'm not gonna say you deserved
that, but you deserved that.

724
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:58,080
Thanks. Help me... Help me up.

725
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:04,169
<i>♪ My heart is beating

726

<i>♪ My heart is beating

727
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:11,881
Don't move. I'm gonna

728
