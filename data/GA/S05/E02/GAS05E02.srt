1
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,331
What are you doing?

2
00:00:17,802 --> 00:00:19,284
Eating cereal.

3
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:20,986
I got us a chicken for dinner.

4
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:23,922
Chicken? Seriously?

5
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,957
You're not gonna be hungry now.

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,461
You're doing it all
wrong, again, as usual.

7
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,596
I'm not. I'm cutting from
the media steinum out.

8
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:35,850
You can't see the media
steinum without your glasses.

9
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,203
Damn. Where are my glasses?

10
00:00:41,692 --> 00:00:44,893
No, put it down. Put it down.

11
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:48,230
Right here. Right here.

12
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,132
Move.

13
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,527
What would I do without you?

14
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,796
Starve.

15
00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:13,355
Damsel in distress.

16
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:15,891
Come on.

17
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:24,649
Put her on a monitor, order a
portable chest. Gonna cut your top.

18
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,735
Between my ninth and
tenth intercostal spaces.

19
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:30,271
No hemo or pneumothorax,
vitals are stable. Pull it.

20
00:01:30,374 --> 00:01:32,134
- I wouldn't.
- Mind your business.

21
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:34,492
- Who is this guy?
- Get this thing out of me.

22
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,506
I screwed up in
front of the chief.

23
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,049
I messed up a suture and now he's
looking at me like I am number 12.

24
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:43,711
Mer, please, no one gets
to see me like this. OK?

25
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:46,671
Yang! What the hell
happened? Get her on a monitor,

26
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,724
- order a portable chest...
- I did.

27
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:51,292
- Check her respiratory funct...
- I did. See?

28
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:52,972
Breath sounds clear and equal.

29
00:01:52,996 --> 00:01:55,963
Quiet. What would you
advise as course of treatment?

30
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:58,750
We leave it in until we get
the chest X-ray and CT back.

31
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,436
- I'm fine.
- What about infection? This is melting

32
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:03,883
- dirty roof water
into her body.
- Pull it out!

33
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:07,725
Leave it. You get stabbed in the
chest, lucky enough to still be breathing,

34
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:11,529
you leave the knife in until you
figure out what's going on. Leave it.

35
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,993
- Take it out.
- Leave it.

36
00:02:13,017 --> 00:02:16,201
Since you know so much,
teach your interns to treat you.

37
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,520
This is an opportunity
to get back to the basics.

38
00:02:18,622 --> 00:02:20,422
I need to check
on Vincent Kenner.

39
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,574
Kenner is your
responsibility now.

40
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,543
Bear in mind he is my patient,
and I am not about to lose

41
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,246
another trauma case
today. Keep that man alive.

42
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,532
Can I get a word
with you, Dr. Hunt?

43
00:02:32,503 --> 00:02:35,020
Think you'll be able
to restore her memory?

44
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:37,584
I was able to suction blood
and remove the pressure.

45
00:02:37,608 --> 00:02:39,691
Hopeful. Not
certain, but hopeful.

46
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,743
Fifteen blade, please. Ow!

47
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,765
- Something wrong, Dr. Shepherd?
- Oh, my God.

48
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,901
Dr. Hahn asked
about teaching before.

49
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:51,570
When you get a surgeon a
blade, make sure it's handle first.

50
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,640
Suction the bleeders while
I clean and get a glove.

51
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:06,485
- He's really gonna be OK?
- Except for his voice.

52
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:09,637
His abdomen's definitely
tender. He needs another CT.

53
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:12,691
Michael, the insurance,
it's a mistake, right?

54
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:16,762
It's gotta be a mistake. Write down
a name and a number and I'll fix it.

55
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,830
Everything will be fine, right?

56
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,282
Everything's gonna be fine?

57
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:32,310
Maybe later would be better.

58
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:35,380
Sarabeth, come on, honey.

59
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:51,679
- What's going on?
- We're going ahead
with the freezing.

60
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:54,132
Without my consent?
No, I don't think so.

61
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,613
Wanna be the doctor who
doesn't give his all to keep

62
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:59,271
- a man from being
wheelchair-bound?
- Get out!

63
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,067
Don't take orders
from civilians.

64
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:02,907
- You arrogant...
- Shepherd.

65
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,527
Now this patient is
stable, he may never walk.

66
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:09,731
If you try this, he could throw a
clot, have organ failure and die.

67
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,283
We're going ahead
with the freezing.

68
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,822
Ever since this morning, you've
been pissing on everything with a pulse

69
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,158
trying to prove
you're not number 12.

70
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,526
And you're not.

71
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:26,214
But right now, with this
decision, you act like number 12.

72
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,501
Good luck with the
patient, Dr. Torres.

73
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,818
The chief's under the spell of
some insane man in camouflage.

74
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,423
He saved my patient's life. He'll
never talk again but, still, life saved.

75
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,536
What happened to your hand?

76
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,362
Scalpel. Rose. Not intentional.

77
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,332
She's a dead mouse
on the kitchen floor.

78
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:02,762
At some point you gotta
pick it up and throw it away.

79
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:05,453
- Want me to look?
- Mer's gonna
take care of it.

80
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,149
I'm a renowned plastic surgeon.

81
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,291
- Grey's a resident.
- She gives me sex.

82
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,225
Especially when I'm wounded.

83
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:15,847
Oh! Oh...

84
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,349
Is this positioned right?

85
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:21,035
If I'm getting a mammogram.
Lower, to the right.

86
00:05:21,138 --> 00:05:24,406
- Two, what are you doing?
- Draping so your parts
are safe.

87
00:05:24,508 --> 00:05:25,974
Get away from my parts.

88
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,377
Oh. Gentle, gentle, gentle.

89
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,491
- How are you doing?
- Please take my films

90
00:05:31,515 --> 00:05:33,931
'cause my interns are idiots!

91
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,316
How's Mr. Kenner?

92
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,418
- Stable.
- You cannot let him die.

93
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,738
- I'm doing my best, hold still.
- I am. Just shoot it.

94
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:44,943
Hold still because I
wanna ask you a question.

95
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,110
What?

96
00:05:46,196 --> 00:05:48,362
Did you mean what you
said about me and Derek?

97
00:05:48,464 --> 00:05:51,516
Well, this is not
fair. I'm impaled.

98
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,201
I know I talk about it too much.

99
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:57,738
I've gone soft and gooey and disgusting
and if I had to listen, I'd puke too.

100
00:05:57,841 --> 00:06:00,641
But you said what you said
because you were mad, right?

101
00:06:00,743 --> 00:06:02,594
Not because you meant it?

102
00:06:04,014 --> 00:06:08,166
Just take my X-ray and...
It doesn't matter what I say.

103
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:10,435
Of course it matters
what you say!

104
00:06:12,822 --> 00:06:15,823
Of course it matters.

105
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:34,459
You stop... Oh!

106
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,429
Stop taking my picture,
and take my picture!

107
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,303
Anna.

108
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:52,210
Are you feeling OK?

109
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:55,380
Her world is about to fall
apart and she has no idea.

110
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,251
It's all my fault.

111
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,153
What should I do?

112
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:06,057
I know I'm a terrible
person, but what should I do?

113
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,579
She should hear it from you.

114
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:18,186
You're her best friend. Even if it's
the most terrible thing in the world...

115
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:20,822
you should tell her.

116
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,042
Hey.

117
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:28,212
Callie's gonna freeze her
patient. Wanna go check it out?

118
00:07:28,298 --> 00:07:32,067
Hello? Alex? Why
are you ignoring me?

119
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:34,001
I'm hoping if I wait long enough

120
00:07:34,104 --> 00:07:37,738
you'll be as annoyed by the sound
of your voice as I am and shut up.

121
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:45,179
OK... Did I do something?

122
00:07:45,282 --> 00:07:47,766
- You know what you did.
- No. I don't.

123
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:50,301
- Alex, just tell me,
what did I do?
- Shut up.

124
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,963
I had a bad night
and cried like a girl.

125
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:54,322
I'm over it. You
need to get over it too.

126
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,641
That chill you'll
feel is cold saline

127
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:05,800
rushing through your veins to
lower your core body temperature.

128
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,586
And if it works, I walk?

129
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:11,489
If it works, the hope
is that you walk.

130
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,226
Wow... OK...

131
00:08:15,312 --> 00:08:17,011
I'm getting cold.

132
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:20,513
His temp's still 96.8. Shall
we lay another cooling blanket?

133
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,612
Up to you, Dr. Torres,
you're taking point.

134
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:25,770
That's what the chief of a
number one teaching hospital does,

135
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:29,991
he hand picks talented surgeons and
lets them take point. Right, Dr. Bailey?

136
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:33,745
- Couldn't agree more.
- Warm and toasty's
what I'm feelin'.

137
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:37,148
His pulse is falling.
Are you sure?

138
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,996
- Down to 52.
- It's normal for his pulse to fall.

139
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,900
How much longer do we got?

140
00:08:41,972 --> 00:08:43,733
Not too much longer.
You're doing great.

141
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:47,392
- Keep thinking
warm and toasty.
- OK. I'm trying.

142
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,594
Good.

143
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,647
Number 12, my ass.

144
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,184
You wanna hear
how I cut my hand?

145
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,086
It's a good story.

146
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:02,123
I am not sure moving in
together is a good idea.

147
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:04,675
OK. Fine.

148
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:07,545
- Fine? What does that mean?
- It means that I know you.

149
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:11,182
- Didn't believe
I'd let you move in?
- I believe you believe it.

150
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,385
Look, I'm gonna move
very slowly. Baby steps.

151
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,588
No sudden moves. You're
like a deer in the woods.

152
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,350
OK, I built the
house of candles.

153
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:21,142
It's unprecedented in
the<i> Meredith Chronicles.</i>

154
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:23,678
- Fine. Let's move in together.
- Fine.

155
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,964
Unless you wanna go
ahead and get married.

156
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:30,902
Gotcha. Wanna know
where I learned that?

157
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,087
Goes with the story
of how I cut my hand.

158
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:34,889
What did you say to Alex?

159
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,391
I... I didn't say anything.

160
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:42,446
I just said that I think it's nice
that you two are friendly again.

161
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:46,017
Why can't you mind your own
business? I should have never told you.

162
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:49,337
Can't keep anything to
yourself unless it's for Cristina.

163
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:50,971
Izzie.

164
00:09:51,941 --> 00:09:54,992
- Marriage?
- Not funny.

165
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,547
Dr. Bailey.

166
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,986
- Yeah?
- Mr. Briar's abdomen
is more tender.

167
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:09,507
I know I'm supposed to get a CT,
but if we start the surgery after midnight

168
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:13,428
he's not covered and we're
bankrupting him. I say we skip the CT.

169
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,730
You say? You say? No,
you don't say. You ask.

170
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:19,784
And the answer is we don't skimp on
medicine to save money. Get the CT.

171
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:24,222
Doing great. Giving you more sedative
and a paralytic to stop your shivering.

172
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,274
OK. OK.

173
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,481
- We'll need to intubate, Bailey.
- - Coming down.

174
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,198
One, two and three.

175
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,134
And down.

176
00:10:38,154 --> 00:10:40,422
He's down to 90 degrees.
I think that's too low.

177
00:10:40,524 --> 00:10:43,941
- Is that too low?
- You did all the research.

178
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:47,812
I think it's too low.

179
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,114
- Oh, God.
- OK, so, what now?

180
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:55,402
Is this going to resolve? Did they
recommend lido or amiodarone?

181
00:10:55,504 --> 00:10:57,588
Dr. Torres?!

182
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,328
- Dr. Torres?
- He's
barely got a pulse.

183
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,096
Uh, should we do CPR?

184
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:09,384
No! Let's try to avoid jostling
Shepherd's spinal decompression

185
00:11:09,486 --> 00:11:12,320
unless absolutely necessary.

186
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,540
- Crap.
- His heart is likely to stop.

187
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:20,728
- Soon. What are you
gonna do, Torres?
- I don't know.

188
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:24,532
I don't know.

189
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:29,721
How is he?

190
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:32,456
Given him medication to
keep his blood pressure up,

191
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,876
but Betty's husband is not as
stable as we'd like him to be.

192
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:52,293
They're freezing Phillip.

193
00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:54,746
Freezing him.

194
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,731
To try to help him
walk again. I don't...

195
00:11:57,834 --> 00:12:01,119
They explained it
to me very well...

196
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,581
And Betty's having
surgery on her brain.

197
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:07,024
And poor Vincent here
is barely hanging on.

198
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,361
- And Michael...
- It's all right.

199
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:14,065
We'll survive. We always do.

200
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:19,053
I wish he would just look at me.

201
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,657
Sarabeth...

202
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:30,331
Michael lost his job
eight months ago.

203
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:36,538
- What?
- The firm let him go.

204
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,573
He just...

205
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,720
He couldn't bring
himself to tell you.

206
00:12:40,744 --> 00:12:43,444
He just felt like
such a failure.

207
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,080
What...? I don't...

208
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:49,450
Why do you... How
do you know this?

209
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:58,926
He told you.

210
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,332
He told you.

211
00:13:05,835 --> 00:13:07,835
Sarabeth...

212
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:10,638
Anna...

213
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:14,909
Have you been sleeping
with my husband?

214
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:18,579
- I'm sorry...
- He's in V-fib. Code blue!

215
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,100
Get them out of here, please.

216
00:13:36,132 --> 00:13:40,435
You started him on ECMO? You're
taking out his blood and replacing it?

217
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:44,177
It was the only thing to do.
We don't want to jostle his spine.

218
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,168
This'll give his heart rest.

219
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:49,827
We need you to monitor him until we
get him back on. Now are you in or not?

220
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,527
I sent Michael down for the CT.

221
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:11,482
I was hoping we could start the
surgery. Get him in under the wire.

222
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:15,536
But it's almost midnight, so...

223
00:14:15,638 --> 00:14:18,189
It doesn't matter, I
don't care. I don't.

224
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:22,527
Do you know anything
about Betty's husband?

225
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:27,297
He... I think he was dying.
Have you heard anything?

226
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,800
No, I can find out.

227
00:14:30,553 --> 00:14:32,052
Why do men cheat?

228
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:36,840
My husband slept with my friend.

229
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:39,827
He lost his job, and then
he slept with my friend,

230
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:42,997
all the while telling
me he loves me.

231
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:46,834
Why?

232
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:52,856
Maybe he was low.

233
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,360
He was down and he didn't
want you to see him like that.

234
00:14:56,463 --> 00:15:00,064
In pain. Weak. As
less than a man.

235
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:04,035
He has his pride
so he turned away.

236
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:07,321
It's not right, but it...

237
00:15:07,423 --> 00:15:10,657
It doesn't mean he
doesn't care about you.

238
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,327
I swear it doesn't.

239
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:23,387
<i>♪ And I told you to be patient ♪</i>

240
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,457

00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,192

242
00:15:28,277 --> 00:15:31,245
- All right, we all ready to wean?
- - Let's do it.

243
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:45,209
It looks like he's tachycardic.

244
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,622
Should we shock him?
Give him adenosine?

245
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,981
Normally I'd say yes,
but this man's an ice cube.

246
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:55,403
Torres, in any of your research, was
there anything to suggest what to do?

247
00:15:55,505 --> 00:15:58,656
I mean, um... I think
I messed up here.

248
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:03,210
I don't... I don't know. Maybe
he would've been fine on his own.

249
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:05,712
- Maybe...
- All right, look at me. Look at me.

250
00:16:05,814 --> 00:16:09,250
Focus. You're trying something
new. Nothing wrong with new.

251
00:16:09,352 --> 00:16:12,714
Breaking new ground, pushing
boundaries comes with the job.

252
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,873
So, Dr. Torres, take a breath,

253
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:21,512
stop panicking and just tell
us. What did your research say?

254
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:26,400
My research showed that...

255
00:16:26,502 --> 00:16:32,373
That arrhythmias can
occur at a certain threshold.

256
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:36,310
His appears to be between

257
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:40,581
- 91.5 and 92 degrees.
- He's around 90 right now.

258
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:43,634
We could use the ECMO
to help bring him back up.

259
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:47,838
Yes, but not too quickly because
that can cause problems of its own.

260
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,791
All right, looks like we
have some warming to do.

261
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,033
What do you see?

262
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:02,804
Uh, it kinda looks
like it's hitting nothing.

263
00:17:02,906 --> 00:17:07,107
Oh. It looks like it's hitting
nothing because it's hitting nothing!

264
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:09,710
- So what does that mean?
- What do you mean,

265
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:13,180
"What does that mean?" Don't
you know how to read an X-ray?

266
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,250
- You always read them.
- Oh, get out.

267
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:20,888
All of you just get out and
find me someone with a brain.

268
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:29,931
Those your interns?
Seem pretty scared of you.

269
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:31,098
I am not scary.

270
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:38,071
What are you doing?

271
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,616
- That's my icicle.
- Yeah.

272
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:51,719
You took out my icicle.

273
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,971
I didn't give you
permission to do that.

274
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,340
So?

275
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,462
Cristina.

276
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:06,600
He died.

277
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,573
- Patient still alive?
- He's stable.

278
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:16,877
Let some soldier talk you into
something that could've killed a man.

279
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:19,379
- He deserved the chance.
- No way of knowing

280
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:21,915
- if it helped or hurt.
- He deserved a chance.

281
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:26,136
He deserved the best, the most
that this hospital could give him.

282
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:29,957
I've let a lot of things slide
over the past few years.

283
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,492
I've been...

284
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:35,096
- soft - This was not
about you being soft.

285
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:40,050
I think it's the fact that Meredith is
here, that Ellis's daughter is here.

286
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,337
Chief...

287
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,373
Vincent Kenner.

288
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:49,726
We gave him 31 units of
blood, fresh frozen plasma,

289
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,963
multiple liters of LR... We
did everything we knew to do,

290
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,799
we couldn't bring him back.

291
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,175
You don't know
how to do anything.

292
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,511
None of you.

293
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,481
You're halfway through
your second year of residency,

294
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:14,334
and you walk around here like
it's your God-given right to be here.

295
00:19:14,437 --> 00:19:18,422
Well, it is not,
Dr. Grey, I assure you.

296
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,108
You are here because I allow it.

297
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,579
You are here to do what I say.
And the one thing I asked you to do...

298
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:27,547
- You can't even save...
- Richard!

299
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,900
We can't save everybody.

300
00:19:35,224 --> 00:19:37,491
We should try harder.

301
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:40,260
We should try harder.

302

00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:55,371
Michael, Sarabeth is here.

305
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:59,112
He's a little tired. The CT showed
the hematoma's getting worse,

306
00:19:59,214 --> 00:20:02,549
so Dr. Bailey and I will be
taking him down to the OR soon.

307
00:20:04,387 --> 00:20:06,787
But he wrote you this letter.

308
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:09,523
I'm not interested.

309
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,225
"Sarabeth."

310
00:20:11,327 --> 00:20:15,395
Sorry. That wasn't
me, that was the letter.

311
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:18,782
"I know you hate me."
Again, not me. The letter.

312
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,983
I'm just gonna read.

313
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:22,219
Um... "I know you
hate me right now.

314
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,505
And you have every right to.

315
00:20:24,607 --> 00:20:27,241
I betrayed you. I
betrayed our marriage.

316
00:20:27,343 --> 00:20:32,229
But I had lost my job and I couldn't
tell you, so I told Anna instead,

317
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,898
which was wrong and stupid.

318
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:39,704
I've wanted to tell you a million times.
And let you know how truly sorry I am.

319
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:44,174
But now I have no voice,
so I'm begging you, please,

320
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:49,079
if you could just listen with
your heart..." That is so poetic.

321
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,298
That was me, sorry,
not him... Sorry.

322
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,452
"If you could just
listen with your heart

323
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:58,289
when I tell you that I know
you can't forgive me right now,

324
00:20:58,374 --> 00:21:01,608
but I'm gonna do everything in
my power to make it up to you.

325
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:06,797
But no matter what happens,
no matter what you decide to do...

326
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:10,234
I'm going to love you
until the end of time."

327
00:21:15,224 --> 00:21:19,443
That's it. I'm done talking. Well,
he's done. He's done. The End.

She's not awake, but I
can take you to see her.

333
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:44,351
- And her memory?
- We don't know yet.

334
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:54,294
Oh, no. Oh, please don't say it.

00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,431
- I'm sorry, Vincent...
- Oh, God.

336
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:03,854
- Oh, God, no.
- Very sorry.

337
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:06,991
- Sarabeth...
- Don't, don't, don't. Just... don't.

338
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,377
Sarabeth...

339
00:22:12,114 --> 00:22:15,883
Vincent's dead and Betty...

340
00:22:15,985 --> 00:22:18,568
We don't know if
she's gonna be OK,

341
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:23,808
- and Phil and Michael.
- Don't you mention
his name to me.

342
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,060
Sarabeth.

343
00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:28,779
More bad things have
happened to us today

344
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,848
than have ever happened before.

345
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,218
We've been blessed. Until today.

346
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,439
I took it for it granted.
I took you for granted.

347
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,992
We've been friends for 50 years.

348

Ever since we were little girls.

349
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:48,966
And I made one
awful, awful mistake.

350
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:54,671
- But I need my best friend.
- You slept with my husband...

351
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:59,843
- Please...
- I'm going to go see Betty.

352
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,214

It's about somethings, not being

I make mistakes. Guys

And I don't know
everything. Nobody does.

372
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,477
So I make mistakes. And I learn.

373
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:26,247
And the next time I don't
make that mistake again,

374
00:24:26,349 --> 00:24:28,682
so the next guy,
that guy? He lives.

380
00:25:00,182 --> 00:25:03,116

00:33:35,363 --> 00:33:36,629
Yeah, I did.

504
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:38,164
Why?

505
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:41,952
I... I mean... Sorry.

506
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:44,287
Were you in love with her?

507
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:46,490
Thought I was.

508
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:50,493
But I was too
scared to admit it.

509
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:54,748
I did know that she
did not like me that way,

510
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:58,067
and I did it anyway.

511
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,969
And I shouldn't have because...

512
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:01,638
I'm...

513
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:07,644
Besides just
being so selfish, I...

514
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:12,282
You know, take advantage of her
that way, to want her to want me like that

515
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,517
when clearly she...

516
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:19,005
Like I said, I made
mistakes the last year,

517
00:34:19,107 --> 00:34:21,775
but I'm trying to
get back on track.

518
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:25,044
- I gotta do that by myself.
- The only reason I...

519
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,381
I wanted to help...

520
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:30,650
is because I feel like

521
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:34,804
you and I are more
than just roommates.

522
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,622
We are more than just roommates.

523
00:34:38,226 --> 00:34:40,460
We are?

524
00:34:40,562 --> 00:34:44,881
Yeah, we're friends. I mean, right now,
you're probably one of my best friends.

525
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:47,917
Best friend.

526
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,356
I'm not an experimenter.

527
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:45,976
I don't like to experiment.

528
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:50,529
But then you showed
up, and we did it together,

529
00:35:50,632 --> 00:35:52,916
and the experiment
was kind of a success.

530
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:54,317
Oh.

531
00:35:56,705 --> 00:35:59,288
Oh!

532
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:03,893
Look, I've never
done this before.

533
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,178
I... I've never kissed a girl.

534
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,015
I'm not sure I even
like kissing girls.

535
00:36:09,117 --> 00:36:12,268
I don't, actually,
like kissing girls.

536
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:13,703
I just...

537
00:36:13,789 --> 00:36:16,506
like kissing one girl.

538
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:18,607
You.

539
00:36:20,194 --> 00:36:22,829
I don't have anything
to compare it with.

540
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:26,700
I... You're the only
woman I've ever kissed.

541
00:36:26,802 --> 00:36:31,070
- So you're freaking out too?
- A lot of therapy time.

542
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:33,840
I don't do therapy.
I just get all... Ah!

543
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,575
And then I get
all clingy, and...

544
00:36:35,677 --> 00:36:38,445
OK, you don't need
to know that yet.

545
00:36:40,048 --> 00:36:41,280
So...

546
00:36:41,382 --> 00:36:45,701
Does this... This kind of
makes us virgins, doesn't it?

547
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:48,821
I guess, in a way, it does.

548
00:36:48,923 --> 00:36:51,091
Virgins.

549
00:36:51,193 --> 00:36:53,593
Hey, we can be scared together.

550
00:36:53,695 --> 00:36:58,431
Kind of virgins, and, yeah,
we can be scared together.

551
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,270
- OK?
- Yeah. Thanks.

552
00:37:06,374 --> 00:37:08,308
You said Derek and I
would never make it.

553
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:11,628
And then I was karmically
impaled for saying it.

554
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,730
But you're right.

555
00:37:12,781 --> 00:37:14,380
People don't have
happily ever afters,

556
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,983
people barely have ever afters.

557
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:21,271
So why would Derek
and I be any different?

558
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,042
Mer. Why do you
care what I think?

559
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,444
Because you're my person.

560
00:37:29,898 --> 00:37:32,732
And if I'm going to do this
with him, be whole and healthy.

561
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,968
Be a warm, gooey person
who lives with a boy...

562
00:37:36,071 --> 00:37:38,788
I need you. I need you on board.

563
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,372
I need you to cheer me on.

564
00:37:40,474 --> 00:37:44,277
Because you're the
only one who knows me...

565
00:37:44,379 --> 00:37:46,345
darkly.

566
00:37:46,948 --> 00:37:48,515
Really knows me.

567
00:37:48,617 --> 00:37:52,885
I need you to pretend that I can
do this, even if you don't believe.

568
00:37:52,987 --> 00:37:56,523
Because if you abandon
me now I will never make it.

569
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:58,391
I'll never get my happy ending,

570
00:37:58,493 --> 00:38:00,810
- and that's just...
- Life.

571
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:03,430
I'm saying please here.

572
00:38:08,103 --> 00:38:11,637
I think you and
Derek will make it.

573
00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:13,373
You'll make it work.

574
00:38:13,475 --> 00:38:16,058
Are you just telling
me what I want to hear?

575
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,932
I am your person.

576
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,602
I'm on your side.

Listen up, people!

Listen up.

606
00:40:43,658 --> 00:40:46,826
We used to be the best
surgical program in the West.

607
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:51,064
An upstart program
that no one ever heard of

608
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:54,433
that blew everyone
out the water.

609
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:57,904
And then, overnight, we got old,

610
00:40:58,006 --> 00:41:02,208
entrenched and sloppy,
just like everyone else.

611
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:05,011
We've been resting
on our laurels.

612
00:41:05,112 --> 00:41:07,847
You have all been failing.

613
00:41:07,949 --> 00:41:11,584
Failing to take initiative, failing
to ask the tough questions.

614
00:41:11,686 --> 00:41:13,386
Failing to practice your skills.

615
00:41:13,488 --> 00:41:17,056
Failing to give opportunity
to practice skills.

616
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:20,943
And I let it happen.

617
00:41:21,046 --> 00:41:24,913
So you have not
failed, we have failed.

618
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:28,151
Well, it stops.
And it stops now.

619
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:32,305
People sliding over general surgery
as though they'll never see anything,

620
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:35,474
but a heart or a brain through
the course of their career.

621
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:39,495
As though blood from the heart doesn't
make its way through the whole body.

622
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:43,599
Or the nerves don't
travel past the brain stem.

623
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:47,553
It's shoddy teaching, and it
makes for shoddy surgeons.

624
00:41:48,656 --> 00:41:51,190
We've failed.

625
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:56,479
Get it? We all have.
And it stops now.

626
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:04,254
The surgical training protocol
is officially changing, people.

627
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,990
The bar has been raised.

628
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,795
Consider yourself on notice.

629
00:42:12,898 --> 00:42:15,331
<i>Reality. It's so much
more interesting</i>

630
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:17,717
<i>than living happily ever after.</i>
