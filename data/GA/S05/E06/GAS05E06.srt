00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:03,613
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:04,864
The chief's under the spell

3
00:00:04,888 --> 00:00:06,532
of some insane
man in camouflage.

4
00:00:06,556 --> 00:00:08,890
Major Owen Hunt.
I'm a trauma surgeon.

5
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:11,410
You're reading your mom's diary?

6
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,432
I'm not half the
surgeon my mother was.

7
00:00:13,496 --> 00:00:15,459
Chief wants us to give
George one of our interns?

8
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:21,319
You didn't even think to ask
for me? Screw you, Dr. O'Malley.

9
00:00:21,404 --> 00:00:25,457
We can take it slow.
Maybe just... first base.

10
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:36,117
Meredith.

11
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:39,287
- I'm only opening one box.
- Plan was not to open any.

12
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:41,339
The plan was to take
the boxes to the attic.

13
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:44,142
Look, it's Anatomy Jane.

14
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,895
<i>For a surgeon, every
patient is a battlefield.</i>

15
00:00:46,997 --> 00:00:50,098
- I'll never have my own office.
<i>- They're our terrain,</i>

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,236
<i>where we advance, retreat,
try to remove all the landmines.</i>

17
00:00:54,338 --> 00:00:57,355
- And she still has
her little twosh.
- Her what?

18
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,674
Anatomy Jane had
detachable organs.

19
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:02,861
I could never remember the
real names, so I made up names.

20
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:05,697
Like the twosh was
next to the chubbel.

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,234
And that was
connected to the slivvy.

22
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,164
Oh, and look, it's
the jelly pouch.

23
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:12,587
Jelly pouch, my favorite.

24
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,723
Still can't get enough
of the jelly pouch.

25
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,041
<i>Just when you think
you won the battle,</i>

26
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:19,895
<i>made the world safe again...</i>

27
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,147
<i>along comes another landmine.</i>

28
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,934
- So are we screwing
other people or not?
- What?

29
00:01:26,036 --> 00:01:29,676
I want to know if you're gonna go
screw O'Malley or some other loser.

30
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:32,774
Then I don't cancel my
plans with the chick from Peds.

31
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:38,446
You're an ass.

32
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,256
What?

33
00:01:42,753 --> 00:01:45,754
- That was amazing.
- Yay.

34
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,040
It was for me, too.

35
00:01:49,226 --> 00:01:53,061
- I mean, that was amazing.
- For me too!

36
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,015
My whole life,

37
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:02,003
my whole adult life, I
have been with men,

38
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:06,758
and it always felt,
you know, fine, good.

39
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,427
But I never...

40
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,215
I mean, I did, but not...

41
00:02:13,317 --> 00:02:15,517
Not like this.

42
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,522
This is like... needing glasses.

43
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:25,477
- I blinded you?
- No. When I was a kid,

44
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:28,881
I would get these headaches
and I went to the doctor,

45
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:31,093
and they said that
I needed glasses.

46
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:33,919
I didn't understand that.
It didn't make sense to me

47
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:37,322
because I could see fine,
and then I get the glasses

48
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:41,025
and I put them on and I'm
in the car on the way home,

49
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:44,045
and, suddenly, I yell...

50
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:50,318
because the big green blobs
I'd been staring at my whole life,

51
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,988
they weren't big green blobs!

52
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,809
They were leaves... on trees.

53
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,979
I could see the leaves.

54
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:03,748
And I didn't even know I
was missing the leaves,

55
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:08,403
I didn't even know that leaves
existed, and then... leaves.

56
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,358
You are glasses.

57
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:17,662
I am so gay.

58
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:20,632
I am so, so, so gay.

59
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,734
I am extremely gay.

60
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:27,205
Um...

61
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,109
I have to go.

62
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:44,900
Gentlemen, I want you to meet the
new head of trauma at Seattle Grace,

63
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:48,159
Major Owen Hunt. You remember
Derek Shepherd, Mark Sloan?

64
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,178
- He stole my patient.
- Mine too.

65
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,298
- Now you'll get
a chance to steal mine.
- Looking forward to it.

66
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,328
I talked to a friend
of mine at the DOH.

67
00:03:55,352 --> 00:03:58,186
Now that we have Owen,
we are being reclassified

68
00:03:58,288 --> 00:04:01,640
as a level-one trauma unit
by the end of the month.

69
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,057
That explains it.

70
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,971
My mom bought it
for me when I was five,

71
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:08,713
which was a super creepy gift
for a five-year-old, but I liked it.

72
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,095
Run!

73
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:23,428
- OK, what was that all about?
- I just saw Owen. Major Owen Hunt.

74
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,797
The guy who pulled
the icicle from my chest.

75
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,867
- I thought he was in Iraq.
- Now he's here, in my hospital.

76
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:32,687
- OK, so?
- So... So we kissed.

77
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:36,057
He kissed me. It was stupid,
it was nothing. Stupid nothing.

78
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:39,227
But you don't think he
thinks it was a stupid nothing.

79
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:41,646
He obviously likes me,
he's back. What's he doing?

80
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:45,333
Don't think he quit the military for
you? That'd be severely stalkery,

81
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:46,645
but very romantic.

82
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:49,437
I'm not getting involved
with another attending.

83
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,173
Coast clear?

84
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:02,883
- You paged me, chief?
- Yes, I did.

85
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:07,322
'Cause generally, when I'm paged to
the helipad, there's something landing.

86
00:05:07,424 --> 00:05:11,309
Yeah. You pulled off a 12-person
domino surgery last week.

87
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,706
That's the kind of thing
we need every week.

88
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,649
It's the kind of thing that shows me
you'll be a great surgeon someday.

89
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:20,001
- Well, thank you, sir.
- It's not enough.

90
00:05:20,103 --> 00:05:23,399
I don't want you to be just
great. I want you to be the best.

91
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:27,092
If you're gonna succeed me as the
best general surgeon in this hospital,

92
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:30,211
you need to start now, today,
which means you need to be me.

93
00:05:30,314 --> 00:05:32,780
You want to take point
on a surgery, take point.

94
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:35,817
Problem comes up, solve
it. Don't talk to me, just do it.

95
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,969
- Be me.
- Be you?

96
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,337
Be me.

97
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:42,306
I can do that.

98
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,476
I don't know why you had to
bring me all the way up here to...

99
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,846
That's why. Lake Washington
Med is sending over a 10-year-old girl

100
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:52,149
with an abdominal
leiomyosarcoma. It's inoperable.

101
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:57,572
You're gonna have to put together a
team and come up with a plan to save her.

102
00:05:57,674 --> 00:05:59,808
Save a girl with an
inoperable tumor?

103
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:02,661
It isn't easy being me.

104
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:04,662
What's wrong with you?

105
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:06,130
What's wrong with me?

106
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,752
We've been sleeping
together for a week

107
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,334
and already you're bored.

108
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:11,720
I'm hot and great in bed,
so what's wrong with you?

109
00:06:11,822 --> 00:06:16,023
I didn't say I was bored. I asked if I
should keep sleeping with Michelle.

110
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,859
I'm asking if you're all
in. What's wrong with that?

111
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:23,498
You're a barbarian. How can I
be all in with an actual barbarian?

112
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:27,535
Fine. Claudia in Radiology thinks
I have a hot ass. I'll tap that next.

113
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,154
You do that.

114
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:32,089
Would you mind picking
up... Lexie, I'm your roommate.

115
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,303
- You'll eventually
have to talk to me.
- I reject that supposition.

116
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,812
- I reject your rejection.
- I ignore your rejection
of my rejection.

117
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:40,915
- I don't reject you, George.
- Thank you.

118
00:06:41,017 --> 00:06:45,103
OK, two things. You all
have a skills lab this morning.

119
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,939
It is mandatory. Don't
think about trying to get out.

120
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:51,142
Second, one of you will not
have to go to the mandatory lab

121
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,128
because you will be assisting me

122
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,609
in my efforts to remove an
inoperable tumor from a 10-year-old girl.

123
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:58,043
- I'll do it.
- You won't.

124
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:00,446
You have a hundred
delinquent charts.

125
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,732
You will do those after the lab.

126
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:03,756
Slacker.

127
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,668
How can you operate
on an inoperable tumor?

128
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,743
- Karev is also out. You doubted me.
- What did I say?

129
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:11,279
- I don't doubt you.
- Yang is out too.

130
00:07:11,381 --> 00:07:13,865
You weren't supportive
of a fellow resident

131
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,262
who couldn't get his
paperwork under control.

132
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:19,320
What is that? Grey,
is that Anatomy Jane?

133
00:07:19,422 --> 00:07:21,238
- Yes.
- With the 24 removable organs

134
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,118
and the optional parts
to simulate pregnancy?

135
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:27,262
- Yes. Does that mean
I'm out too?
- No, that means you're in.

136
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,491
- Yes!
- Not fair.

137
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:29,397
Next time you'll know

138
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:31,216
to bring in an ugly doll.

139
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:37,305
Dr. Yang, what exactly
happens in a skills lab?

140
00:07:37,407 --> 00:07:40,608
- Who are you?
- I'm your new intern. Ryan Spalding.

141
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,546
I'm never gonna
remember that. You're... 4.2.

142
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:49,484
Three, Three.

143
00:07:49,586 --> 00:07:52,620
- Is everything OK?
- Shut up. Don't move.

144
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,783
I'm Dr. Hunt. Over
the next few months

145
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,559
I'll be teaching you how to
work quickly and efficiently

146
00:07:57,661 --> 00:07:59,939
to keep someone alive
in the circumstances

147
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:02,641
where the safe bet is they're
dead by the end of the hour.

148
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:05,316
Anyone have a problem
working with live tissue?

149
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:06,729
- Live tissue?
- Anyone?

150
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:09,286
Speak now. In fact, leave now.

151
00:08:09,372 --> 00:08:11,655
If not, I own you for
the rest of the day.

152
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,525
Good. Here we go.

153
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,171
Each resident gets
a pig, interns assist.

154
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,439
Hang on.

155
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:41,652
Go ahead.

156
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,338
Save their lives.

157
00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:58,803
You're a monster.

158
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,189
They're under, they
didn't feel any pain.

159
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,075
- You stabbed them!
- Yeah, so we can save them.

160
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:07,862
We can practice on surgical mannequins.
We can learn to do the same stuff.

161
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,531
- Does that mean you're out?
- Yeah, I'm out!

162
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:14,052
In that case, who
wants two pigs?

163
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:22,877
Tori Begler, age 10. Tori has
an abdominal leiomyosarcoma.

164
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,981
The tumor is wrapped around
her celiac artery, her splenic artery

165
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,501
and her left gastric artery. It
is considered unresectable.

166
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:33,003
Did you understand
a word of that, Tori?

167
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,822
Not really.

168
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:36,691
Grey.

169
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:42,113
This is Anatomy Jane.

170
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,215
She's kinda funny-looking.

171
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,902
She is funny-looking,
but she's very helpful.

172
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:52,073
So the tumor... is way
down here in your belly.

173
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,543
Hard to get at because it's
underneath all these organs.

174
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:57,262
Hard but not impossible, right?

175
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,724
We're gonna try
everything we can.

176
00:09:59,783 --> 00:10:02,901
Everything you can should
include your cardiothoracic gal.

177
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:06,471
Dr. Stewart at Seattle Pres said
the vasculature is the problem,

178
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:10,491
and you stole the best
cardiovascular surgeon he's ever had.

179
00:10:10,593 --> 00:10:14,395
If she's not on Tori's team we're
leaving, going to San Francisco.

180
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:18,766
Fudge? It's homemade.

181
00:10:21,771 --> 00:10:24,756
- I love this hospital.
- Yeah, no small talk. Come on.

182
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,191
- More lessons?
- No lessons, just sex.

183
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:31,262
Nothing fancy, just plain
missionary, boy/girl, penis/vagina sex.

184
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:35,700
I mean it. No dirty talk, no Erica talk.
No talk. Just grunting and grinding.

185
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,369
- Now who's talking dirty?
- Shut up!

186
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,089
- What's this about?
- I'm testing a theory.

187
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:47,929
Good. That looks good.

188
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:51,031
Are you petting the pig?

189
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:53,968
Stop petting the pig.

190
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:59,757
Spending a lot of time on that
anastomosis. What's your name again?

191
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,139
Yang. Cristina Yang.

192
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:04,328
Right. Come take a
look at this guy's pig.

193
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,150
- O'Malley?
- This is gonna be good.

194
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,733
- Make way for Dr. Yang.
- See what he did?

195
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:12,036
He stopped the bleeding, then
moved on to his liver laceration.

196
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,555
But sloppy work can
lead to complications.

197
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:17,258
Two days from now when
this pig starts vomiting blood

198
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,155
O'Malley'll wish
he'd been thorough.

199
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,313
He can come back later, make
things pretty when his pig is stable.

200
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:25,216
Meanwhile your pig is getting
acidotic and hypothermic.

201
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:27,702
If this was a scrawny
kid, he'd be dead by now.

202
00:11:27,804 --> 00:11:32,023
- Quick and dirty, Cristine.
- "A." Cristina.

203
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,845
Let's guide the catheter
into the celiac axis.

204
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,661
Turning on the fluoro.

205
00:11:37,314 --> 00:11:40,014
What? Excuse me a sec.

206
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,935
Hello, you can't be in here.

207
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,786
That's my Uncle
Pat and Aunt Jean.

208
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:49,557
They like to make
sure I don't get lonely.

209
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:53,111
She's not lonely. Dr. Grey
and I are very entertaining.

210
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,502
OK, fine. They have to stay in
there. There's radiation in here.

211
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,706
All right, let's inject dye.

212
00:12:14,684 --> 00:12:16,917
Is everything OK?

213
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,121
Uh... It's fine.

214
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,731
Owen Hunt is a
murdering, sadistic bastard.

215
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,561
Let me guess,
your first wet lab?

216
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:34,335
He's stabbing pigs,
defenseless pigs,

217
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:36,737
or as he likes to call
them, "live tissue,"

218
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,174
God forbid you should
call them animals.

219
00:12:39,276 --> 00:12:41,170
He is the new head
of trauma, Stevens.

220
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:44,156
May not be ideal, but if that's
how he does things, roll with it.

221
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,081
We don't need live subjects. What
happened to "first do no harm"?

222
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,883
That's about all living things.

223
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:52,803
Actually, I think it's
just about humans.

224
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,389
I'm saying this to you as my
roommate and not my attending.

225
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:57,141
Uh-huh.

226
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,026
You disgust me.

227
00:13:01,231 --> 00:13:03,731
- Damn it!
- What, it wasn't good for you?

228
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,967
- Impossible.
- It's not that it wasn't good.

229
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:09,470
It's that it was.

230
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,310
- A "thank you"
would've been nice.
- You paged me?

231
00:13:16,412 --> 00:13:19,497
Got a 10-year-old girl with a
tumor wrapped around her aorta.

232
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:22,200
- I'm putting together a team.
- This is her angio?

233
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,742
Thing is wrapped
around five major arteries.

234
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:28,623
- It's bad, but I've got ideas.
- Try them on someone
who might actually live.

235
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,259
I admit it doesn't look great,

236
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:33,294
but her family
mentioned you by name.

237
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,163
That's nice, but I
really don't care.

238
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:38,082
Well, I do.

239
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:42,253
Don't get emotional, Bailey. No
one likes a girl who gets emotional.

240
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:48,059
Still, I'd like you on my team.

241
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,999
I'm sorry about this, little
guy. It must've been awful.

242
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:58,203
One day you're at some
beautiful farm out in the country,

243
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:01,823
breathing in the fresh air, lounging
in the mud with your friends.

244
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,390
Next thing you
know you're sedated

245
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:06,188
- and stabbed in
some skills lab.
- Get it together.

246
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,812
Heads up.

247
00:14:07,897 --> 00:14:10,464
Take your interns
down to ER. I'll meet you.

248
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:14,251
Multiple MVC. Six incoming.
You, lab's over. Do your charts.

249
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,187
- What about my pig?
- She's got it.

250
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,905
- What?
- You're staying here.

251
00:14:18,008 --> 00:14:20,341
With a half dozen
crash victims into the pit?

252
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,578
You have four struggling
victims here. Keep them alive.

253
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,464
Karev gets to work on people
and I have 300 pounds of bacon?

254
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,500
Live bacon. They better
be that way when I get back.

255
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:38,442
Thirty-five-year-old backseat passenger,
forehead versus window, the window won.

256
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,262
Second-degree burns on the
left side. Vitals stable en route.

257
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:43,375
- Trauma one. What do you got?
- Charles Hiott, 46.

258
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:46,634
Positive ecchymosis over
abdomen. Last BP 96 over 68.

259
00:14:46,736 --> 00:14:47,946
Know how to do a
trauma ultrasound?

260
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,737
- Yes.
- In that case he's yours.

261
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,340
- Can I help you?
- Dr. Karev paged us.

262
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:53,641
Got it covered.

263
00:14:53,743 --> 00:14:55,971
A head injury and burns.
Don't think you have it covered.

264
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,095
- Karev, are you a doctor?
- Yes, sir.

265
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,631
You capable of assessing
a patient's injuries?

266
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,333
- Yep.
- Like I said, got it covered.

267
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,196
- Let us dive in.
- Appreciate the offer,

268
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,300
but I want my residents to
learn to deal with trauma.

269
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:08,272
They won't learn
as much or as fast

270
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:13,761
if they watch attendings do
it unless that attending is me.

271
00:15:13,863 --> 00:15:16,848
Three other hospitals have
already sent them away.

272
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,583
And if we were smart, we
would do the same thing.

273
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:22,854
What is the matter with you?

274
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:25,056
We can try and cut
around the stomach.

275
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,169
No. The only way to
do that is to take it out.

276
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:31,195
- They've done ex-vivo
autotransplants.
- With livers and kidneys.

277
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,625
Why don't we take out
the stomach and kidneys?

278
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:35,928
That'd be great, if
you wanted to kill her.

279
00:15:35,952 --> 00:15:39,270
We're talking about two completely
different blood supplies here.

280
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,739
So no, not a good idea, Grey.

281
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,893
Who are those people?

282
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:50,347
Uh, that's Tori's dad,
Randy, and his brother, Pat,

283
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,651
and Pat's wife, Jean,
and Tori's brother David...

284
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:56,521
- Why are they staring at us?
- I don't think they're staring.

285
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,967
I think they're just waiting...

286
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,908
seeing if we have any news.

287
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,078
Try and come up with
something before I get back.

288
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,082
Close the blinds, Grey.

289
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,138
- You paged me?
- Rambo's completely
out of control.

290
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,191
- Excuse me?
- Hunt. He kicked me
out of my own ER.

291
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:19,010
- Did he kill somebody?
- Not yet.

292
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,579
Call me when he does.
I don't have time for it.

293
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:26,133
I have a dying 10-year-old and doctors who can't
stop bickering long enough to solve a problem,

294
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:30,254
except for your girlfriend who's
more interested in playing with a doll.

295
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,240
She dragged that thing all around
the hospital when she was five,

296
00:16:33,342 --> 00:16:36,110
and let me tell you,
it was cuter in a child.

297
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,499
- Any luck?
- What do you think?

298
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,545
I know you want
to be number one,

299
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,965
but we can't take in every
charity case that comes along.

300
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:49,656
It is a huge waste of resources.

301
00:16:51,027 --> 00:16:53,577
It's your call, Dr. Bailey.

302
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,696
Grey, put that away.
This isn't playtime.

303
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:59,833
I'm not playing, I'm thinking. What
if we took out each of the organs

304
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,536
where the tumor interferes
with the blood supply?

305
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:06,240
By the time you clamp off the aorta
you risk damaging the other organs.

306
00:17:06,342 --> 00:17:09,443
- Even if you
take them out one by one?
- You don't have the time.

307
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:13,130
What about if we made the time?

308
00:17:15,017 --> 00:17:19,086
Dr. Bailey, let's throw
some stuff up on the board.

309
00:17:22,225 --> 00:17:24,992
CT showed a subdural
hematoma. Should I book an OR?

310
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:27,928
First thing's first. The scalp
is bleeding. What do you do?

311
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,131
- I page Shepherd.
- Shepherd's not here.

312
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:31,633
What do you do to
stop the bleeding?

313
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:33,829
Suture laceration,
tie off bleeders.

314
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:37,671
That'll take two hours. What would
you use in this room to take care of this?

315
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:39,557
- Staples?
- It's his forehead.

316
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:42,626
Want this guy to look like
Frankenstein the rest of his life?

317
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,406
- Skin glue.
- Excellent.

318
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,148
Clean it, close it, stick a
pressure dressing over it.

319
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,118
- How are you feeling,
Mr. Hiott?
- Not too good.

320
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,331
How'll we make
Mr. Hiott feel better?

321
00:17:52,355 --> 00:17:55,256
Ultrasound showed free fluid.
We'll get him to a CT to confirm.

322
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:58,008
- Pretty much OR bound.
- Excellent. Is that tetanus?

323
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:01,528
Know who we have to thank for
the invention of the tetanus shot?

324
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:05,366
Horses. First experiments
were done on horses.

325
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,000
Want to take out her
abdominal organs?

326
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:14,175
- Intestines, stomach, everything?
- - All at once?

327
00:18:14,277 --> 00:18:15,609
That's right.

328
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:18,762
We'll put the organs on ice
while we dissect out the tumor,

329
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,382
then reconnect the vessels
using synthetic grafts

330
00:18:21,484 --> 00:18:22,883
and put the organs back in.

331
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:26,381
Why didn't Graham or Fleisher
over at Lake Washington suggest this?

332
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,989
They're a couple of smarties.

333
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:31,875
Probably because it's
never been done before.

334
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:36,096
It is extremely risky. There are any
number of things that could go wrong.

335
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,334
I don't know, Randy. Maybe
we should try more chemo.

336
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:44,839
With all due respect, Mrs. Begler,
I don't think there's time for that.

337
00:18:45,942 --> 00:18:48,192
Is it going to save her life?

338
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:51,929
It's your best shot.
Your only shot.

339
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:59,937
- Then do it.
- OK.

340
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,642
Dr. Bailey, I'm not a vet,

341
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:09,013
and while I can appreciate the value
of practicing technique on live tissue,

342
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,993
there's a multiple
MVC in the pit

343
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:14,396
and my education will be far
better served practicing on humans.

344
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,371
- Who's babysitting
the pigs now?
- My interns.

345
00:19:17,473 --> 00:19:20,474
Major Hunt order the interns
to baby-sit the pigs or you?

346
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,543
- Not the point.
- Make it the point.

347
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:24,723
I don't have time. I'm taking
six organs out of a person.

348
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,514
See, that's not fair.
I'm not Dr. Doolittle.

349
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:31,184
The zebras and the elephants
are thanking their lucky stars for that.

350
00:19:34,022 --> 00:19:36,056
I have a question.

351
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:39,960
Why aren't we taking out the kidney
since the left renal artery is involved?

352
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:43,948
We can remove the tumor
without doing that, so why bother?

353
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,519
- I have another question.
- Yes?

354
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,855
Why can't you look at me?

355
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:55,442
- What?
- You can't look at me.

356
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,295
You haven't been able
to look at me all day.

357
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,614
I think you're imagining things.

358
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:05,619
Oh, I don't think I am.
But, hey, if you say so.

359
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:10,741
I do. I say so. Instead of worrying
about whether or not I'm looking at you,

360
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:15,796
concentrate on saving a 10-year-old
girl that we're about to eviscerate.

361
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,741
Dr. Grey, why do we
dissect down in quadrants?

362
00:20:27,843 --> 00:20:31,879
So we can look at the vessels to
make sure we have reconstruction.

363
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,821
- Very good.
- - Suction in here, please.

364
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,567
Tori's dad is on the phone.
OR desk wants to know

365
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,381
- if they can put him through.
- No.

366
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,855
- He's insistent.
- I'm busy.

367
00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:45,358
I think... Hold this up a
little bit higher, Dr. Grey.

368
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:47,861
I want to make
sure to avoid... that!

369
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:50,308
Let's get some clamps.

370
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,883
Another clamp, please.

371
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:55,580
- Right there.
- Let's hang another bag of blood.

372
00:20:55,604 --> 00:20:57,866
Better hope the
aorta's not that friable.

373
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,441
Otherwise all the blood in
the world won't save this girl.

374
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,297
- Ryan, what's Reggie's pulse?
- Sixty-nine.

375
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,118
Really? 'Cause Wilbur's at
102. I'm pretty sure that's bad.

376
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,254
- Babe's like an ox. Hers is 52.
- Hey, no cute names!

377
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,507
They're not pets,
they're subjects.

378
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,209
It's not our job to
get affectionate.

379
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:21,095
It's our job to keep them alive,

380
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:25,432
so the attending who thinks we're incapable
can choke on his words at the end of the day.

381
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,668
So I don't want to
hear Wilbur or Babe.

382
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:32,956
You want to call them something,
call them sausage or prosciutto.

383
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,342
Wilbur's crashing.

384
00:21:35,444 --> 00:21:39,780
- What? What did you do?
- I don't... I don't...

385
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:43,583
I gotta re-open that thoracotomy.
Pull that chest tray back.

386
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:49,523
- Dr. Bailey?
- Removing the organs on three.

387
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,877
Ready? One... two...

388
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:56,630
three.

389
00:22:00,203 --> 00:22:02,436
Let me have it.

390
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:08,675
Wow.

391
00:22:08,777 --> 00:22:11,428
I'll need medium
and large vessel loops

392
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,497
to dissect out the tumor.

393
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,616
Mr. Begler again. He wants to
talk to you about his daughter.

394
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:19,403
- I'm pretty busy.
- I already told him that.

395
00:22:19,489 --> 00:22:21,438
- Tell him again.
- I've told him 18 times.

396
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,324
Chief, you need
to go talk to them.

397
00:22:25,628 --> 00:22:27,745
Hey, you did put me in charge.

398
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:32,149
I'll be back.

399
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,803
What the hell?
Look at this crap.

400
00:22:35,905 --> 00:22:39,439
Is that glue? You
used skin glue?

401
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:42,359
Dr. Hunt wanted to get
him out of there pretty quick.

402
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,228
Because Dr. Hunt didn't
have you revise the wound,

403
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:46,897
he could lose half his face.

404
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,061
You can't rotate a flap,
you call someone who can.

405
00:22:49,085 --> 00:22:51,996
He says the ER's like being in
the field. Use what's available.

406
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:56,240
What qualifies us as a war zone,
Karev? Our undermanned gift shop?

407
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,726
The lukewarm drinks
from the coffee cart?

408
00:22:58,828 --> 00:23:00,527
Guy's a meatballer.
What do you expect?

409
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,146
- Meatballer?
- Trauma guys slap it together.

410
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:08,986
- Dr. Webber, how's Tori?
- Stable.

411
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:11,755
We're removing the tumor.
I should be in there to help,

412
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,924
- but I'm out here instead.
- I just needed an update.

413
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:16,876
Not important you get
an update right now.

414
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:20,364
The best doctors we have
are focused on your daughter.

415
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:23,501
Calls and interruptions
don't help us focus.

416
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:27,154
I'm sorry. I know we have
been underfoot sometimes,

417
00:23:27,256 --> 00:23:29,368
but we have been
to a lot of hospitals,

418
00:23:29,392 --> 00:23:32,293
and hospitals are not easy
places to get information.

419
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:35,546
A lot of times it's impossible
to get a doctor to talk to you

420
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:38,010
or to get the doctors
to talk to each other.

421
00:23:38,034 --> 00:23:41,635
And I don't know if it's neglect
or their egos getting in the way,

422
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:45,055
I don't care. We're just trying
to take care of our little girl.

423
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:49,193
She's 10, she's
scared and she's sick.

424
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:51,979
We're doing whatever we can.

425
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,751
Don't ever stop taking
care of her like that.

426
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:02,122
<i>♪ I've tried, but I couldn't
find any warning of you ♪</i>

427
00:24:02,224 --> 00:24:04,675
Stevens, have you
ever used a GIA stapler?

428
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,177
No, but I'm ready,
I can handle it.

429
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:09,596
Answer me three
questions and I'll let you.

430
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,732
- OK.
- Question one:

431
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:15,102
The polio vaccine, which animal
do we have to thank for that?

432
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:18,222
- This really necessary?
- Only if you want
to use that stapler.

433
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:20,658
- Flipper babies.
- What?

434
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,199
Flipper babies. Ten thousand
babies were born with birth defects

435
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:27,192
in the 1950s because their
pregnant mothers took Thalidomide.

436
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:30,417
First developed on guinea pigs.
Guinea pigs didn't have side effects.

437
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:32,636
- And your point?
- My point is that

438
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:34,949
humans and animals
have different physiologies,

439
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,857
- different reactions.
- They can have
different reactions.

440
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:42,012
- Doesn't mean they will.
- Tell that to those
10,000 babies and moms.

441
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:45,332
So the polio vaccine, developed
using mice and monkeys.

442
00:24:45,434 --> 00:24:48,985
You can keep your
stapler. It's not worth it.

443
00:24:50,306 --> 00:24:52,439
Give me the status
on Reggie and Paddy.

444
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:54,541
Reggie's fine. Paddy's
pulse ox is low but stable.

445
00:24:54,644 --> 00:24:56,160
- Babe?
- Holding steady.

446
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:58,289
Thought we weren't
supposed to give them names.

447
00:24:58,313 --> 00:24:59,613
I could give them numbers

448
00:24:59,715 --> 00:25:01,882
but then I'd tell you
Three needs antibiotics

449
00:25:01,984 --> 00:25:04,284
and find you shoving
a needle in Grey's ass.

450
00:25:04,386 --> 00:25:06,586
His vitals are getting
worse, damn it.

451
00:25:06,689 --> 00:25:09,473
- Uh, did you check his lung?
- I took out an entire lobe.

452
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:11,775
- His descending aorta?
- I've tried everything.

453
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:13,861
Pulseless.

454
00:25:13,963 --> 00:25:15,896
That's it. We need to
give him more exposure.

455
00:25:15,998 --> 00:25:20,734
- You're opening him up more?
- I need everyone's help,
stem to stern.

456
00:25:20,836 --> 00:25:23,204
What if he can't take
it? You could kill him.

457
00:25:23,306 --> 00:25:27,307
Don't get emotional. Get ready to
start massaging his heart. Scalpel.

458
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:32,729
Bailey, can you
dissect any more?

459
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:36,133
There's nothing to dissect.
There's barely any artery left.

460
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:38,585
What about if we extend
the Gore-Tex graft?

461
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:40,354
What's left is too friable.

462
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,723
We can't reconnect the
organs to the vessels?

463
00:25:42,825 --> 00:25:47,061
- Not at this moment. No.
- But if
we can't reconnect,

464
00:25:47,163 --> 00:25:49,112
they won't reperfuse
and they'll die.

465
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,943
- Yes, they will.
- - Too late for a transplant?

466
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,486
Well, we'd have to find six
good organs in about eight hours.

467
00:25:55,588 --> 00:25:59,489
- It's too late
for a transplant.
- And a gold star for Grey.

468
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,268
We could put in more Gore-Tex.

469
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,037
Oh, put even more
synthetic material in?

470
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:17,440
- What about
a saphenous vein graft?
- She's getting acidotic.

471
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:20,144
- That has to be pre-planned.
- What's your idea?

472
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:21,940
- Excuse me?
- You're good at shooting down

473
00:26:21,964 --> 00:26:23,574
every idea we come
up with. What's yours?

474
00:26:23,598 --> 00:26:27,300
It was my idea not to do this
in the first place, Dr. Bailey.

475
00:26:27,402 --> 00:26:30,654
Yeah, and you made that
very clear every chance you got.

476
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,823
Shut up! I don't care
who had what idea when.

477
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:38,128
Get over yourselves. Shut
up and talk to each other.

478
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:48,839
What about using
human umbilical vein?

479
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:54,061
- Ready to go,
already heparinized.
- OK. I like it.

480
00:26:54,163 --> 00:26:56,897
- Erica, what do you think?
- It could work.

481
00:26:56,999 --> 00:27:00,701
It's Dr. Bailey's call,
if she wants to do it.

482
00:27:00,803 --> 00:27:04,988
- I do.
- OK, in that case, let's do it.

483
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,108
Nice work on the valve.

484
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,144
First developed in pigs,
but more recently in cows.

485
00:27:11,247 --> 00:27:14,882
Are you done beating me up for
the day because I'd like to go home.

486
00:27:14,984 --> 00:27:17,334
- I was trying to teach you.
- You want to teach us?

487
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:21,036
Take us to the Simulab with the
plastic guys who have heart rates

488
00:27:21,122 --> 00:27:23,468
and blood pressure and
croak when you nick an artery.

489
00:27:23,492 --> 00:27:26,643
Until you apply scalpel to skin
you're just going through motions.

490
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,857
That attitude?
That's from before.

491
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:31,159
We have technology. We
don't have to torture creatures.

492
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:34,534
You don't get to accuse me of
torture. Those animals felt no pain.

493
00:27:34,636 --> 00:27:36,953
You don't know that.
You don't know that.

494
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:40,857
You don't know what they felt, you
don't know how scared they were.

495
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,827
Animals are sensitive
and intelligent creatures.

496
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:47,497
And that is not me being
emotional, that is simply the truth.

497
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,435
Want me to learn from your methods?
Want me to learn anything from you?

498
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:55,872
Then don't stab pigs in front of
me and tell me the sky isn't blue.

499
00:27:55,957 --> 00:27:59,693
You are torturing God's creatures in
an age where we have the technology

500
00:27:59,795 --> 00:28:02,562
that no longer requires us to. If
you want to do that, go ahead,

501
00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:06,149
but don't tell me I'm less
of a doctor for walking away.

502
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,339
Come on, Wilbur, don't do this.

503
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:15,392
His heart's not
filling. You know...

504
00:28:15,477 --> 00:28:18,779
Massage it with both
hands, like a heart sandwich.

505
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:21,281
Good. Good.

506
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,567
There! Right there.
Stupid. Look at that.

507
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:27,987
The knife went through his
diaphragm into his spleen. OK.

508
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:29,556
Hand me those clamps.

509
00:28:29,658 --> 00:28:32,425
We've got blood pooling
the lower left quadrant.

510
00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:34,078
Anybody see where
it's coming from?

511
00:28:34,163 --> 00:28:36,930
Here. This graft.
Satinsky clamps.

512
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:39,717
- And four-0 Prolene.
- Scissors.

513
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,254
Waiting, Dr. Bailey.

514
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,508
OK, this thing's coming out.

515
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,494
We're still waiting, Dr. Bailey.

516
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:55,165
OK. Suction. Clear it out.

517
00:28:56,585 --> 00:28:57,984
OK, release clamps.

518
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,084
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

519
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,926
- Right in here.
- Still nothing.

520
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,761
No pulsation.

521
00:29:12,234 --> 00:29:14,801
Come on, come on.

522
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,956
Reperfusion complete!

523
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,258
The heart's beating on its own.

524
00:29:24,646 --> 00:29:25,795
All right!

525
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,666
All right.

526
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:34,087
Everyone, hell of a job.

527
00:29:40,562 --> 00:29:44,514
I've known women to be upset because
they couldn't make it to the big finish.

528
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,661
Never had anything
to do with me.

529
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:49,047
Usually something to
do with their anatomy.

530
00:29:49,071 --> 00:29:51,604
Point is, I've never known
a woman to be upset

531
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:56,910
because she could take a curtain
call. You're a conundrum, Torres.

532
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,947
Erica cried this morning.

533
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:04,217
In bed. After sex.

534
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:07,370
That was a compliment, for you.

535
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:11,391
- The crying was a compliment.
- It wasn't a compliment for me.

536
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:16,046
She was having a
revelation. She was having...

537
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,348
The sex is awesome with Erica.

538
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:22,719
We've reached
awesome, which is...

539
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:26,122
- Awesome.
- Yes, but it's also
awesome with you.

540
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:28,491
So, what's the problem?

541
00:30:30,145 --> 00:30:32,912
Guess I thought there
should be a difference...

542
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:35,815
between you and Erica.

543
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:39,970
If I'm... There should
be a difference.

544
00:30:42,658 --> 00:30:45,158
The difference
between me and Erica

545
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,862
is that I know you had
sex with her 12 hours ago.

546
00:30:48,964 --> 00:30:52,524
She doesn't know you had sex with
me, and that makes you a cheater.

547
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:56,002
Do you want to be a
cheater? 'Cause I'm fine with it.

548
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,989
The question is, are you?

549
00:31:01,743 --> 00:31:03,609
Gonna yell at the major
general. Wanna come?

550
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:07,130
- Hell yeah. Be right there.
- Hey, Torres.

551
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:08,765
Hey.

552
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:13,886
- Hunt, can I talk to you?
- Sure.

553
00:31:13,989 --> 00:31:16,639
- Karev?
- No, no, he can stay.

554
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:19,905
Want Karev to hear how you screwed
up the flap of my head trauma, fine.

555
00:31:19,929 --> 00:31:21,639
My job's to keep him
alive. It's what I did.

556
00:31:21,663 --> 00:31:23,874
What you did was almost
maim a guy for the rest of his life.

557
00:31:23,898 --> 00:31:26,733
You're lucky I saved
the blood supply.

558
00:31:26,835 --> 00:31:29,903
- What would you have done?
- A man with a deep scalp wound,

559
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:33,089
and two of the best surgeons in
the country standing ten feet away.

560
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:37,694
I would've asked those two surgeons
to step in. That's what I would've done.

561
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:41,631
I mean, medically. What would you
have done medically so I can do better?

562
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:45,251
I recognize there's different ways
of doing things, even the basics.

563
00:31:45,353 --> 00:31:47,453
Here, someone appears
dead, you go to them first.

564
00:31:47,555 --> 00:31:51,608
In Iraq someone appears dead
you don't. This is day one for me.

565
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:55,578
You think there's a better
way then tell me, and I'll listen.

566
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:05,288
- Again, both of you, great job.
- Thank you.

567
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:09,910
Is there a problem, Dr. Bailey?

568
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:12,946
Just find it hard to believe
you're accepting congratulations,

569
00:32:13,048 --> 00:32:16,549
considering you didn't
want to do this operation.

570
00:32:16,651 --> 00:32:19,836
When you finally did do it, you
fought me every step of the way.

571
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:25,942
And yet you still had a world-class
heart surgeon by your side.

572
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:31,414
You may be a fine surgeon, God
knows I know that, but not today.

573
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:35,651
Today you were
a pain in the ass.

574
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:40,590
A naysaying, bullying,
consistently negative pain in the ass.

575
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,692
At no point did you encourage me

576
00:32:42,777 --> 00:32:46,530
or do anything to make me think this
surgery could be anything but a failure.

577
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:51,284
And it wasn't just me. You made it as
hard as humanly possible for all of us.

578
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:56,223
So, yeah, we did do a nice job
today. We did a great job today.

579
00:32:56,341 --> 00:33:00,243
But that wasn't thanks to you,
that was thanks to me and the chief.

580
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,578
And Meredith Grey.

581
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:04,397
And Anatomy Jane.

582
00:33:07,468 --> 00:33:09,185
Babe is indestructible.

583
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:12,572
She lost a part of her liver and
small bowel but she's doing fine.

584
00:33:12,674 --> 00:33:16,326
We had to cross-clamp Wilbur's
aorta and massage his heart.

585
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:18,478
I couldn't locate the
source of his bleeding

586
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:22,064
until I found a hole in his diaphragm,
realized he had a splenic laceration.

587
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,100
He's a fighter,
he's pulling through.

588
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,686
Reggie had some oozing
after his colon resection,

589
00:33:26,788 --> 00:33:29,305
but we packed it and he's
been stable ever since.

590
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:33,059
Paddy almost bled out because
his carotid was sliced right through.

591
00:33:33,161 --> 00:33:35,321
We put in a graft. He's
been stable ever since.

592
00:33:35,414 --> 00:33:37,964
- He's good as new.
- That's good.

593
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:39,866
That's great work, all of you.

594
00:33:39,968 --> 00:33:44,170
So put them out and make
sure you write up all your work.

595
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,957
- What do you mean
"put them out?"
- Terminate them. Kill 'em.

596
00:34:04,826 --> 00:34:08,644
I'm not killing those pigs. I spent
the day trying to keep them alive.

597
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,174
Want them dead, do it yourself.

598
00:34:10,198 --> 00:34:11,948
You resected half
of a liver today.

599
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,752
You repaired a diaphragm, did a
splenectomy, grafted a severed artery

600
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:18,488
and repaired a lacerated
bladder, performed a lobectomy.

601
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:22,041
And I understand you
even removed a tumor.

602
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:25,144
On Paddy, his thyroid.

603
00:34:25,246 --> 00:34:28,915
You have any idea how
much you just learned?

604
00:34:29,017 --> 00:34:33,219
They'd be in pain. Those are
massive injuries, months of recovery.

605
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:36,289
To keep them alive after
all that, it's not humane.

606
00:34:39,127 --> 00:34:41,027
Seriously, you don't
remember my name?

607
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:43,763
I remember your name,
but that was before.

608
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,299
This last tour, I was on
a forward surgical team.

609
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:54,857
We... treated combat
casualties in the field.

610
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,021
You're mostly looking
to do damage control:

611
00:34:57,045 --> 00:34:59,757
Sedate 'em, ventilate 'em, airlift
'em to Baghdad, get out of there.

612
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:02,927
Only this one time we
didn't get out fast enough

613
00:35:02,951 --> 00:35:06,853
'cause we ended up in the
middle of an RPG ambush.

614
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,458
There were 20 people in my
unit, including me, and 19 died.

615
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,362
And then I got discharged.

616
00:35:16,464 --> 00:35:20,567
So... I'm not there
anymore, in the before.

617
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,687
I knew your name in the before.

618
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,691
Now I'm living in the after.

619
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:46,142
- Erica.
- You want to apologize
to someone,

620
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:49,745
apologize to Bailey. Thanks to
you, I made her life a living hell.

621
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:51,214
I slept with Mark Sloan.

622
00:35:54,636 --> 00:35:58,170
If that's your idea of an
apology, you seriously...

623
00:35:58,272 --> 00:35:59,839
Shut up!

624
00:35:59,942 --> 00:36:04,427
You were crying
and seeing leaves.

625
00:36:04,512 --> 00:36:07,180
And I wasn't.

626
00:36:07,282 --> 00:36:10,650
OK? I may never see leaves.

627
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,603
Or maybe I will see leaves,
but I'll also see flowers.

628
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:15,889
I might be a whole
forest girl, I don't know,

629
00:36:15,991 --> 00:36:18,202
but I do know that I
want to be with you

630
00:36:18,226 --> 00:36:21,127
and... to do that I have to
at least tell you the truth,

631
00:36:21,229 --> 00:36:24,030
and the truth is I slept
with Mark Sloan today.

632
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,953
OK.

633
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:32,688
Twice, actually.

634
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:37,093
OK.

635
00:36:41,216 --> 00:36:44,918
- You paged?
- Yeah. How's Tori?

636
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,786
She's good, stable.

637
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:56,629
You weren't imagining things.

638
00:36:56,731 --> 00:37:00,166
You used to run around
here with that doll all the time.

639
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:04,570
Took her everywhere. The
cafeteria, the old art gallery.

640
00:37:06,008 --> 00:37:09,308
Tori's got a whole army.
You didn't have anyone.

641
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,661
Seeing Anatomy Jane

642
00:37:12,747 --> 00:37:15,999
reminded me of how
much I was to blame for that.

643
00:37:17,752 --> 00:37:21,187
You're a living reminder
of every failure in my life.

644
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:24,157
That's not your fault.

645
00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:29,128
And if I thought "I'm sorry" would hold
any meaning for you at all, I'd say it.

646
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,899
I'd say it a thousand
times a day.

647
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,935
<i>Some wars are never over.</i>

648
00:37:40,275 --> 00:37:42,608
<i>Some end in an uneasy truce.</i>

649
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:49,799
I can't do it.

650
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:52,202
I know I'm supposed to, but...

651
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:57,223
They'll suffer.
Don't let them suffer.

653
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:11,120
<i>♪ From the valley to the stars ♪</i>

654
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,573
- So no more on-call room, huh?
- Afraid not.

655
00:38:14,675 --> 00:38:16,575
That's too bad.

656
00:38:17,478 --> 00:38:20,780
Guess I'll, uh, see you around.

657
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,901
Hey.

658
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:26,419
Wanna get a drink?

659
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:29,653
Really?

660
00:38:29,691 --> 00:38:31,390
Just 'cause we're
not sleeping together

661
00:38:31,492 --> 00:38:34,394
doesn't mean we can't
hang out, be friends.

662
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,983
You're good for
more than sex, Mark.

663
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:41,884
I would love to get a drink.

664
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:48,692
- She's not gonna
cry every time, right?
- No. That passes.

665
00:38:55,350 --> 00:39:01,587
<i>Some wars result in
complete and total victory.</i>

666
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,860
Sit.

667
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:16,586
Mac and cheese, from
the box, not the freezer.

668
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,639
<i>Some wars end
with a peace offering.</i>

669
00:39:24,412 --> 00:39:26,378
I named the pigs today.

670
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:31,434
I'm sorry, but I don't
know what that means.

671
00:39:32,487 --> 00:39:35,021
I take things personally.

672
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,357
I get too emotional.

673
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:41,394
There's no place for it at work,
not with the pigs and not with you.

674
00:39:43,197 --> 00:39:44,730
I'm sorry.

675
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,608
This is so much better
than the freezer kind.

676
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:08,404
Thought you were sleeping with
Michelle tonight, or was it Jackie?

677
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:11,073
- Iz.
- I've had a hard day, Alex.

678
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,626
And a sad night. Please
just leave me alone.

679
00:40:13,728 --> 00:40:15,494
- Izzie.
- What?

680
00:40:15,596 --> 00:40:17,447
I'm not good at this, all right?

681
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:21,050
I'm not good at relationships
or talking about stupid feelings

682
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:25,722
and you are, so maybe you could
teach me or something, you know?

683
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,773
Tell me what I did wrong.

684
00:40:29,945 --> 00:40:32,846
You don't want us
to see other people.

685
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:40,854
You don't want us to see other people
and that's how you tried to tell me...

686
00:40:40,956 --> 00:40:44,541
by asking if it was cool
if you screwed Michelle.

687
00:40:44,643 --> 00:40:47,292
- Laughing's not helping.
- I'm sorry.

688
00:40:47,395 --> 00:40:48,995
I'm sorry.

689
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:55,401
- So you want lessons, huh?
- I want lessons.

690
00:40:55,503 --> 00:40:59,272
OK. You start with,
"Isobel Stevens,

691
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:02,008
you are staggeringly
good in bed.

692
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:05,544
You're amazingly
smart, wonderfully funny,

693
00:41:05,646 --> 00:41:08,547
- and you care about animals."
- That's where I start?

694
00:41:08,649 --> 00:41:11,167
Yeah. And then you say,

695
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:12,549
"You want to go steady with me?"

696
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:15,204
That's what I'd
say if it was 1952.

697
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:24,347
- Alex.
- Yeah?

698
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:26,850
You want to go steady with me?

699
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:30,765
If that's what you want.
I mean, yeah, whatever.

700
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:33,189
<i>And some wars...</i>

701
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:34,674
<i>end in hope.</i>

702
00:41:34,776 --> 00:41:36,425
Oh, look!

703
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:39,128
I wore this every day
to elementary school.

704
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,481
Nice. Your mom
make that for you?

705
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:47,653
Yeah, right. She probably got it at
the lost and found at the hospital.

706
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,740
- Mer, you should do this one.
- Is it more ugly hats?

707
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:55,727
- Another diary?
- More than one.

708
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,763
<i>But all these
wars are nothing...</i>

709
00:41:57,865 --> 00:41:59,531
Oh, my God.

710
00:41:59,633 --> 00:42:02,101
