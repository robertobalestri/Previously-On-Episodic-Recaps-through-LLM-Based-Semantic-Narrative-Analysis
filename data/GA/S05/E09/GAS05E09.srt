1
00:00:03,371 --> 00:00:05,570
<i>When you're little,
nighttime is scary</i>

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:09,241
<i>because there are monsters
hiding right under the bed.</i>

3
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:14,246
<i>When you get older, the
monsters are different.</i>

4
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,416
<i>Self doubt...</i>

5
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:20,619
<i>loneliness...</i>

6
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,123
<i>regret.</i>

7
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:27,359
<i>And though you may
be older and wiser,</i>

8
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,861
<i>you still find yourself
scared of the dark.</i>

9
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:35,283
- I'm crazy. That's what this is.
- You're not crazy.

10
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:38,170
Then what is this?
What...? What are you?

11
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:42,290
- I'm a dead man who loves you.
- This is my imagination.

12
00:00:42,392 --> 00:00:45,093
- I have an active imagination.
- You touched me.

13
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:47,157
When you were
alive. And kissed you.

14
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:50,582
Everything that's happening
happened. I'm reliving moments.

15
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:53,051
This is just residual grief.

16
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:59,041
So I guess the only way
to test it is to do something

17
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:02,311
we never got a
chance to do in real life.

18
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,866
- Dr. Yang.
- Dr. Hunt.

19
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,635
Uh...

20
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:48,573
- You here for me?
- What?

21
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:52,377
I meant my trauma.

22
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,330
I'm here for a possible appy.
Ambulance is on its way in.

23
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,018
Hey...

24
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:07,109
Did you want to say something?

25
00:02:10,347 --> 00:02:12,197
How'd you beat the ambulance?

26
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:16,852
I live across the street.

27
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:28,346
Your sofa sucks. I can't sleep.

28
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:32,267
- I never went to bed.
- Usually read
on the bathroom floor?

29
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:35,871
I didn't want to wake Derek.
These are my mother's journals.

30
00:02:35,973 --> 00:02:39,274
- From when she was a resident.
- I thought we hated your
mother.

31
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:42,661
I kind of think now, if I wasn't
her child, I would have liked her.

32
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:46,565
She was funny. And
intense. A lot like Cristina.

33
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,450
Yeah. Intense, I get from
Cristina. Funny, not so much.

34
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:54,122
She takes a while to warm up,
but when she does, she's Cristina.

35
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:57,209
Give her a chance. She's very
loyal, and you need allies here.

36
00:02:57,311 --> 00:03:00,429
What do you think about...
what's her name, your sister, Lexie?

37
00:03:00,531 --> 00:03:03,948
- What do I think about her?
- As an ally for me.

38
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:08,469
- My new intern BFF.
- No, I... No, I don't see that.

39
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:11,223
I just... She was raised
right. With parents and rules

40
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:14,676
- and smiley face posters
on her wall.
- Mm.

41
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:21,499
It's Cristina. There's
an appy. See? Loyalty.

42
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:27,005
I'll come with you. Try to snag
time in the skills lab. I'll get dressed.

43
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:29,608
Oh, my God!

44
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:33,278
- Hot.
- Porny.

45
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,715
What... What are
you doing out here?

46
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:40,585
You're the only one who paid a
nurse to page you with an appy?

47
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,321
- That's not what I meant.
- Yes!

48
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:47,075
That's what I meant. If you're
out here, who's in there with Izzie?

49
00:03:47,177 --> 00:03:50,812
- Oh, my God!
- Derek?

50
00:03:50,914 --> 00:03:54,716
- What? What? What's the matter?
- Nothing. Nothing.

51
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,118
I just...

52
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:59,054
What are you doing dressed?
It's three in the morning.

53
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,890
Who's making a
porno in Izzie's room?

54
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,693
Relax, she's
flying solo. It's hot.

55
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,031
Iz, party's over. We
got an appy coming in.

56
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:12,367
Death, let's go.

57
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:15,370
- She's living here, too, Death?
- Just a couple of days,

58
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:17,572
- till she gets her place.
- No more strays.

59
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,225
- No more strays.
- Iz!

60
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:24,079
- Iz, come on!
- Hey. Hi.

61
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:28,433
So I'm not feeling that great.

62
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,570
I think I'm gonna skip it. I
don't know, I think I have the flu

63
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:36,090
- or food poisoning... Yeah. I'm hot.
- You're sweating.

64
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,694
And cold. Hot and
cold. I have the chills.

65
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:42,230
- I'm just gonna go back to bed.
- Didn't sound like you were
sleeping.

66
00:04:42,332 --> 00:04:45,217
I could skip the appy and
help you out if you want.

67
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,152
No! No, I'm...

68
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:49,838
I don't want to
get you sick, too.

69
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,993
- What are you doing here?
- He's mine.

70
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,429
- She's sharing him with me.
- I'm on call.

71
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:00,732
- Good morning, you look nice.
- Brownnoser. I got here first.

72
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:04,302
- The chief said
I'm the one to watch.
- Oh, I get it.

73
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,472
Solo surgery time, and you
heard the past two years the chief

74
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:09,674
assigned an appendectomy.

75
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,143
So you little mini-surgeons
dragged your butts

76
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:17,015
out of bed to pick up some final tips
from the master. That's kind of cute.

77
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,434
- I can use two of you.
- But I'm on call!

78
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:21,602
- I filled Meredith in.
- Jason Kron, 47,

79
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:25,056
- tenderness over
McBurney's point.
- Karev, what do you know

80
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,592
- about Mr. Kron?
- I know he's a lucky man

81
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,429
- to have you as a surgeon.
- Arthur Soltanoff, 45,

82
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:33,498
fell from a second-story
window. Stable vitals, fractures

83
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,885
- and lacerations
with head trauma.
- Trauma One.

84
00:05:36,987 --> 00:05:38,753
I need one of your residents.

85
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:40,738
- Me! Mine. I'm on call!
- It's yours.

86
00:05:40,824 --> 00:05:44,625
We have a patient with abdominal
pain. Can you spare a resident?

87
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:47,345
Grey and Yang, prep
Mr. Kron for surgery.

88
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:51,148
Karev, you never know, abdominal
pain could become an appendectomy.

89
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,852
Dr. Bailey, I'm here to
help in any way that I can.

90
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,199
There's a patient
in pain, I'm there.

91
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,693
Can you feel that
there? Can you feel that?

92
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:05,814
There's no need for you
to do that. I can feel that.

93
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:10,852
The residents are here. In the
hospital, so whatever you're doing...

94
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,571
- What are you doing?
- We gave him an epidural.

95
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,757
- And didn't call me?
- It just happened.

96
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:19,393
You know, epidurals don't just
happen. I'm staying at Death's.

97
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:21,479
- Staying at Meredith's? What?
- Lexie!

98
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:25,450
- Dude. He peed himself.
- We forgot the catheter!

99
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,235
- No catheters!
- Do you wanna
pee yourself again?

100
00:06:28,338 --> 00:06:32,707
- No.
- An epidural. Wow. I'm impressed.

101
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,795
- Death is so wrong about you.
- Why? What did she say?

102
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,713
That you were a priss.

103
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,651
Too bad he's not pregnant.
We could do a C-section.

104
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:45,820
- We could
take out his appendix.
- Or amputate his foot.

105
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:48,056
Seriously.

106
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,462
- He doesn't need his appendix.
- We could take out his
appendix.

107
00:06:54,564 --> 00:06:56,814
We'll find an empty
OR, in and out in an hour.

108
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,450
- I'm sitting right here.
- You could watch.

109
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,920
We wouldn't put you
under. Stay on the epidural.

110
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:05,556
I'm off tomorrow. I'd trade and
take his shift so he could recover.

111
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:08,777
- They're all here.
- They're busy
chasing solo surgery.

112
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:11,446
It's a genius idea. We
would be rock stars.

113
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:16,868
No! I draw the line at a
tube in my penis. Line drawn!

114
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,488
Fine. Do me.

115
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,392
As long as I can do
one of you guys next.

116
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:27,746
- Done.
- Done.

117
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,676
- What have we got?
- Massive injuries.

118
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,668
Shepherd and Hunt are working.
Sleepwalking and took a header

119
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,204
- through a window. Night terrors.
- Can you imagine?

120
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:40,725
You wake up, you're battered,
bruised, don't know where you are

121
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:42,668
- or how you got there?
- Like my life:

122
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:46,281
Married, betrayed, gay, abandoned.
Wake up, no idea how I got here.

123
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:49,017
I just figured this is the
bottom, as bad as it gets.

124
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:53,254
- It can only go up from here.
- Tib-fib. Trauma series
is clear.

125
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:55,540
- Needs a head CT.
- Free fluid in there.

126
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,975
Oh, God. Ivy,
get out of the way!

127
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,345
- The mountain lion's there!
- You're in a hospital.

128
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,848
- Ivy! Where's my daughter?
- I'm right here.

129
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,467
He's gonna get my
daughter! Let me go!

130
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,635
- I've gotta get my daughter!
- Calm down.

131
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,039
- He's gonna get Ivy!
- Mr. Soltanoff, calm down!

132
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,865
Let go! She needs me!

133
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:24,835
OK. Bailey's got an appy
in OR 2, so this floor's out.

134
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,872
But outpatient
surgery is totally open.

135
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,992
- OK, let's go.
- Looking for something?

136
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,228
Hi.

137
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:37,431
We were giving Sadie the
tour. This is the OR Board.

138
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:41,302
And this is a patient.
You're in good hands.

139
00:08:41,404 --> 00:08:45,973
- Dr. Grey
is an excellent doctor.
- What's next on the tour?

140
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:52,580
- Back to skills lab?
- Skills lab, great idea.

141
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:56,467
- Gotta stick with my allies.
- Smiley face posters.

142
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:57,935
That's all I'm saying.

143
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,771
Mrs. Hammer, what
seems to be the problem?

144
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,592
I have this pain in my stomach
and I can't keep food down.

145
00:09:04,694 --> 00:09:07,512
- It goes through me.
- Tell him your theory, Lauren.

146
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:10,314
- She has a theory.
- I'm right here, I can speak.

147
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,334
Thinks she has stomach
cancer. The Internet told her.

148
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:17,038
I'm not a hypochondriac!
He's not inside my body.

149
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,691
I have a theory, too.
Crazy disease. Diarrhea.

150
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,526
- Seth.
- Fine. Shutting up.

151
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,646
Let's take a look.

152
00:09:24,748 --> 00:09:28,249
You're not tender over your
appendix. We don't need to take that out.

153
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:31,902
That's a good thing,
right? You look upset.

154
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,721
Just disappointed... for you.

155
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,025
I'm gonna have to
collect a stool sample.

156
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:41,629
I can't believe
this is happening.

157
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:45,283
- It wasn't
a great nose, anyway.
- Yes, it was.

158
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:49,019
- It was a nice nose.
- Relax, I was kidding.

159
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,389
It was a gorgeous
nose and it will be again.

160
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:54,759
- Two weeks,
won't be able to tell.
- Really?

161
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,128
- Three weeks. Four tops.
- I hate you.

162
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,930
- You love me. Little pinch.
- Ow!

163
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,249
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

164
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,185
Come on, that didn't hurt.

165
00:10:05,922 --> 00:10:09,490
Maybe if I was having a good
year, it would feel like a little pinch.

166
00:10:09,593 --> 00:10:12,543
But it hurts,
Mark. It hurts a lot!

167
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:17,181
You know what? I was
gonna do this with some local,

168
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,351
but I think we'll use conscious
sedation. When you wake up,

169
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,104
your nose will be fixed
and it'll be a whole new day.

170
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:26,858
OK. Well, at least
I still have you.

171
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,161
You'll still be my friend and
have sex with me when I want.

172
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,746
Anytime.

173
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:34,449
You know, once your face heals.

174
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:37,452
- I hate you.
- You love me.

175
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,772
I hit a doctor?

176
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:43,524
I don't understand. What
am I even doing here?

177
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:47,528
Your daughter said you were having
a dream and jumped out the window.

178
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,581
- Have a history
of sleepwalking?
- It started years ago,

179
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:54,936
when my wife died. Scared me
so much, I went to a sleep clinic.

180
00:10:55,038 --> 00:10:59,791
They said it was stress-induced,
and gave me some clonazepam.

181
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:03,761
- How's that been working?
- I'm raising a 13 year old,

182
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:07,482
so stress comes with the job. I
haven't had an episode in a while.

183
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,486
I must have forgotten
to take my pill tonight.

184
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:15,573
Honey, I'm so sorry.

185
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,177
- You must have been so scared.
- I'm OK. I'm fine.

186
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,330
- I'm just worried about you.
- I'm sorry.

187
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:30,271
Dr. Sloan. Hi. Hello.

188
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:34,425
Know where they keep the IV
kits? Where are all the damn interns?

189
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,461
The interns are... interning.

190
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,699
- Busily interning. They're very busy.
- Dr. Sloan.

191
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:44,151
- Little Grey.
- I need some medical supplies.

192
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:47,071
Found the intern
in the supply closet.

193
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,325
Did not invite the intern
into the supply closet.

194
00:11:50,427 --> 00:11:52,893
- Go away now, Grey.
- Thank you.

195
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:57,465
Stop looking at me.
I didn't do anything.

196
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,569
- Don't do anything. Don't.
- I didn't. I didn't.

197
00:12:01,671 --> 00:12:05,623
Dr. Bailey, do you have to
visualize the peritoneum?

198
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:10,211
Depends. I've seen so
many, usually just feel it.

199
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,897
Did you split the muscle
this way or that way?

200
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,499
This way. No, that... Hold it.

201
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,402
That way. It's the kind of
thing that becomes so natural,

202
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,222
you don't even think
about it after a while.

203
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:29,213
The two of you are thinking so hard,
it makes me tired just looking at you.

204
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:32,867
- This is so cool.
- Can you believe
we're doing this?

205
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:35,253
The epidural should be working.

206
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:40,708
OK, she's numbed. We're
ready. OK. Here we go.

207
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,378
- You OK?
- I find the fact
you have parents

208
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,881
and smiley face
posters oddly comforting.

209
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:50,368
- What?
- I'm ready.

210
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,387
Surgical marker. I'm
going to mark the incision.

211
00:12:56,392 --> 00:12:59,543
Can you hold that a
little bit closer, please?

212
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:03,982
One third the distance from
the anterior superior iliac spine

213
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:06,367
to the umbilicus. OK.

214
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:10,721
That's right about...

215
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,579
OK.

216
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,199
It's a great day to
save lives, people.

217
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,386
Although, technically,
your life is just fine. And...

218
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:27,371
It's night-time.

219
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,807
- Shepherd says that...
- Could you just go?

220
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,125
Scalpel.

221
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:34,445
OK...

222
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,389
This is a bad idea.
This is a really bad idea.

223
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,910
And it's the middle of the
night, so our judgment is... off.

224
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:52,913
But we can use this frustration that
we feel that's driven us to the point

225
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:55,335
where we're about
to do a stupid thing,

226
00:13:55,385 --> 00:13:58,236
a thing I'm certain we'd
all regret, possibly from jail.

227
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,138
And we can use that
frustration for good.

228
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:05,192
We can ask for more time in the
skills lab, ask to observe more surgeries,

229
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:09,029
and we can demand that
our residents teach us better.

230
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,286
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

231
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:20,308
Or we can just take
out my appendix.

232
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,265
OK. I'm following the taeniae
coli down to expose the appendix.

233
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,367
- Wow.
- There it is.

234
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,220
- I want to see.
- Get her a mirror.

235
00:14:35,358 --> 00:14:38,175
- Ooh! Cool.
- Hmm.

236
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:43,697
- What?
- Does it look
a little inflamed to you?

237
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,483
It does a little.
It looks inflamed.

238
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:50,338
- Can I see a book?
- It's normally
only supposed to be

239
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,756
seven to eight
millimeters in diameter.

240
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,209
Yeah. It looks a little big.

241
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,096
If it's inflamed, this
isn't a routine procedure.

242
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:01,465
It's... We should... We
should call a resident.

243
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,635
- We're not calling a resident.
- Sorry. I was just...

244
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,338
- I'm really freaking out.
- I'm lying open on the table,

245
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,726
and the last thing I need is
panicking. If you can't handle it, leave.

246
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,335
Anybody else?

247
00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:26,340
Kelly clamps and 2-0 silk.

248
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,829
Your dad around? I
need to check stitches.

249
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:35,232
- He's still having tests.
- I'll come back.

250
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:38,886
- Hey. How's that doctor
my dad hit?
- She'll be OK.

251
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:42,573
- Tell her I'm really sorry.
- Why? You didn't hit her.

252
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,642
Yeah, it's just...

253
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,096
if I'd been able to get
my dad back to bed...

254
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:51,398
Sometimes I can
talk him to sleep.

255
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,933
This hasn't
happened for a while?

256
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:57,538
- Him sleepwalking?
- Yeah. Right.

257
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:05,529
- When's the last time
you slept?
- It's OK. I'm not that tired.

258
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:08,716
Seriously, kid, you
should get some rest.

259
00:16:11,955 --> 00:16:15,439
So you diagnosed yourself?

260
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:18,676
I ordered antibiotics online
to kill a staph infection.

261
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:21,863
- Oh, my God!
- My husband
dismissed as a pimple.

262
00:16:21,965 --> 00:16:25,566
- Along with your dermatologist.
- Who barely looked at it.

263
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:29,971
OK? It was a staph infection,
Seth. It was. And it went away.

264
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:33,740
- After I took
the drugs, it went away.
- Pimples go away.

265
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,210
You have C. diff. It's not
going away on its own.

266
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:39,564
- Well, how do I treat it?
- You've basically killed

267
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:44,235
all the healthy bacteria in your body
so we have to introduce new bacteria.

268
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:48,373
- OK.
- By performing
what's called a...

269
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:52,059
- a fecal transplant.
- Poop?

270
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:56,330
- I need a poop transplant?
- We'd feed a small tube
up your nose

271
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:00,101
and down into your stomach.
The donor needs to be someone

272
00:17:00,203 --> 00:17:06,190
who you share everyday
germs with. Typically, a spouse.

273
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:10,144
- Admit it was a pimple.
- Seth.

274
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:14,598
No. I'm not going to crap into a
bowl until you admit it was a pimple.

275
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,252
That's the deal! When you're
ready, come and find me.

276
00:17:19,355 --> 00:17:23,574
- Come on, tell him
it was a pimple.
- It was not a pimple!

277
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,762
None of my interns are answering
pages. Did they go home...?

278
00:17:27,864 --> 00:17:32,166
- Hey! Where are
the other morons?
- I don't know.

279
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:35,119
I was just getting candy and...

280
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,871
I don't know.

281
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,806
- Clearly.
- I don't know. I don't know anything.

282
00:17:42,245 --> 00:17:44,395
Hey!

283
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:49,417
Give me your chocolate.
All of it. Give me that, too.

284
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:58,142
- Where are the stooges?
- That moron is a moron,

285
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:01,228
- and the others are AWOL.
- I need an intern to page me

286
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,148
- if my guy craps.
- I wonder if they're
in skills lab.

287
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,466
- Sadie said something about it.
- In the hospital?

288
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:09,837
Time in skills lab is paying
off. My interns are still idiots,

289
00:18:09,939 --> 00:18:13,107
but they're idiots
that can put in an IV.

290
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:15,142
No, they're just idiots.

291
00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:22,249
- So what's going on with Izzie?
- I don't know what's wrong.

292
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,602
I'm sick of people not
talking to each other.

293
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:27,221
I'm gonna go get my
crap-chick some crap.

294
00:18:33,496 --> 00:18:34,778
Meredith?

295
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,766
Do you have a sec?

296
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,340
- Two! What are you doing?
- I'm only charting!

297
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:51,678
- Well, where's Three and 4.2?
- I don't know? I thought...

298
00:18:51,781 --> 00:18:54,799
Stop. Come with me, you're
doing post-op orders on the appy.

299
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,986
Tell me all about whatever
trouble your little friends are into.

300
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:05,859
- Do you need a leash? Let's go!
- No.

301
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:16,904
- What do you mean, no?
- I mean...

302
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:20,374
I kind of can't walk.

303
00:19:20,476 --> 00:19:23,461
Due to the catheter
and the epidural.

304
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:36,473
I can hear your heart beating.

305
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,995
Which is odd because they
took it out for the autopsy.

306
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,434
This isn't real, is it?

307
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:49,036
This is real.

308
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:53,406
Izzie, this is real.

309
00:19:57,146 --> 00:19:59,513
I'm just gonna
keep my eyes closed

310
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,416
because this is like that moment in
the morning when you first wake up

311
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,154
and you're still half asleep.
And everything seems...

312
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:11,025
Things are possible.
Dreams feel true.

313
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,494
And for that one moment
between waking and sleeping,

314
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:17,931
anything can be real.

315
00:20:18,034 --> 00:20:23,403
And then you open your eyes and
the sun hits you and you realize...

316
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:28,595
I'm just gonna keep
my eyes closed.

317
00:20:35,384 --> 00:20:36,717
OK.

318
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,697
OK.

319
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,669
I think she's dying.

320
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,628
- Her BP is dangerously low.
- We need to push two liters
of LR.

321
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,609
- Should we call a code?
- There is no code team
in outpatient

322
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:10,700
in the night because this would be
done by a surgeon in a regular OR.

323
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:13,837
Page the chief, get Bailey.
Tell her there's an emergency.

324
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:18,508
You're not to say anything else.
Take that crazy look off your face.

325
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:25,082
How's Mr. Soltanoff? His night terrors
are happening more than he knows.

326
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:26,517
The kid's exhausted.

327
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,320
Scary going to bed at night not
knowing what you to wake up to.

328
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:32,990
Sounds like living with
Meredith. She takes in strays.

329
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,945
It's your fault. I never thought
about Little Grey in that way

330
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,963
until you told me not to.

331
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,583
Now, I can't help it.
You planted a seed.

332
00:21:42,685 --> 00:21:44,168
Unplant it.

333
00:21:46,322 --> 00:21:50,056
She wants to tell you something.

334
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:56,079
I believe that you
believe it was a pimple.

335
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:58,949
- Lauren...
- That's the best I can do.

336
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:04,855
- I believe that
you believe it...
- It was a pimple!

337
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:08,241
- It was a staph infection!
- No poo! No poo for you!

338
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:12,396
Wait! Dude, she could lie to you
and tell you what you want to hear,

339
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,432
but she's not. She's telling
you what's real for her.

340
00:22:15,517 --> 00:22:17,684
Stop walking away.

341
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,178
I still think this could
be stomach cancer.

342
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,832
And when I get a headache,
I think it's a brain tumor.

343
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:36,086
And I lay awake and
feel lumps in my breasts,

344
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,456
and my heart starts to race and
I think I'm having a heart attack.

345
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:43,961
So no, I don't think
it was a pimple.

346
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:48,432
The world is a scary place

347
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:52,770
and there are a thousand
things a day that can kill you.

348
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,157
And I don't see
how you don't see it.

349
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:02,146
Dr. Bailey, there's an
emergency in outpatient surgery.

350
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:05,549
- What kind of emergency?
- There's a...

351
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:10,053
It's an emergency. Please come?

352
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,826
I'd like to do an EEG. There's a
chance night terrors are caused

353
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:18,328
by epilepsy in the frontal lobe.

354
00:23:18,413 --> 00:23:21,648
I went through all that in the sleep
clinic. As long as I take my meds...

355
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,150
We have reason to believe the
problem may be worse than you're aware.

356
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:29,039
- I don't understand.
- How often does
your dad sleepwalk?

357
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,491
I sleep. I just forgot
my meds this time.

358
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:34,645
No, you didn't.

359
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,714
You took them while I was
brushing my teeth like you always do,

360
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:40,650
and then you put me to
bed like you always do,

361
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,187
and then you woke up
screaming like you always do.

362
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:48,642
I try to stay awake because
usually I can talk you back to bed.

363
00:23:48,744 --> 00:23:52,763
But tonight, I must
have fallen asleep.

364
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:56,166
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You said these bad dreams

365
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,519
were caused by stress,
and I'm your stress.

366
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:02,039
You take such good
care of me during the day,

367
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:04,675
the least I could do was
take care of you at night.

368
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:08,695
We're saying the nightmares were
caused by epilepsy, not the stress.

369
00:24:08,797 --> 00:24:14,401
If the test confirms epilepsy, you
understand what that would mean?

370
00:24:14,503 --> 00:24:17,738
- This wasn't my fault?
- That it wasn't your fault.

371
00:24:19,007 --> 00:24:20,991
Dad...

372
00:24:23,946 --> 00:24:26,130
Let's get the EEG.

373
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:28,576
Sweetheart.

374
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:37,624
Denny?

375
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,261
Denny?

376
00:24:41,329 --> 00:24:43,463
Denny!

377
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:46,600
- Denny! Denny!
- What's all the yelling about?

378
00:24:46,702 --> 00:24:50,387
You can't do that! You can't
disappear! I thought you were gone!

379
00:24:50,472 --> 00:24:52,906
- I was just...
- I thought you left me again!

380
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:58,245
- I told you, I'm here for you.
- No, you're not. You died.

381
00:24:58,347 --> 00:25:01,482
You died and you left me
here! I was left here by myself!

382
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:05,602
- You left me all alone!
- You're not alone anymore.

383
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:09,456
Why? Why did you come back?
I had moved on! I got over you!

384
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:12,509
I have a life and a
job and a boyfriend!

385
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:15,279
And now you're back
and I'm in this room all day,

386
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:18,282
probably talking to myself!
I'm probably going crazy!

387
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:21,885
There is a real world out there
and I'm stuck in here with you!

388
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:26,006
- I'm sorry I died.
- No! No! Screw you!

389
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:29,593
You don't get to
apologize for dying!

390
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,363
You don't get to apologize
because I killed you!

391
00:25:32,465 --> 00:25:36,433
I convinced you to let me
cut the LVAD and I killed you!

392
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,069
So you don't get to
apologize for dying!

393
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:41,855
- Dead people don't apologize!
- Izzie.

394
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,091
Just shut up! Shut up!

395
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,911

401
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,905
I love you, too.

402
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:20,978
- What the hell is going on?
- Trying to take out
her appendix.

403
00:26:21,063 --> 00:26:25,332
- Whose foolish idea was that?
- Mine.

404
00:26:25,434 --> 00:26:28,718
- Where are we?
- Found the artery
in meso-appendix.

405
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:32,222
- The stitches
the interns did came off.
- Hand me a 3-0 silk.

406
00:26:32,325 --> 00:26:34,719
I need more suction.
How's her pressure?

407
00:26:34,743 --> 00:26:38,078
- 74 systolic.
- She's really bleeding. I can't see.

408
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,748
The stump isn't closed.
She needs a cecectomy.

409
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:44,434
- I can't get
to the appendiceal artery.
- You can. You almost had it.

410
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,453
Here.

411
00:26:46,555 --> 00:26:49,856
- Is your visualization better?
- I can't see anything!

412
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:52,375
Don't panic. Put that down.

413
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:58,098
Feel down for the
meso-appendix. Find the pulsation.

414
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,668
Now follow it to the end.

415
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:07,958
- It feels... I think I've got it.
- Good. Now, place your clamp.

416
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:13,113
OK. That's right. Grey, tie it off
while Yang holds the clamp in place.

417
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,749
- Stick-tie or ligature suture?
- Whatever works.

418
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:18,001
You have to do what
feels right to you.

419
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,454
Ligature suture.

420
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:37,721
- Are we gonna go to jail?
- You're not gonna go to jail.

421
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:42,993
You didn't have the balls to stay.
The rest of us are gonna go to jail.

422
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:47,113
I just heard.

423
00:27:47,215 --> 00:27:49,049
What the hell happened?

424
00:27:49,151 --> 00:27:51,885
We live together. You
should have come to me.

425
00:27:51,987 --> 00:27:53,887
So what? You could
have saved me?

426
00:27:53,989 --> 00:27:55,984
Maybe I could have stopped you.

427
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,141
This isn't about you.

428
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:01,028
This is the one thing I've
done in the past few months

429
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:05,049
that wasn't about getting
you to notice me. I did this.

430
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:08,785
You had nothing to do
with it. This was all me.

431
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:16,977
Dude, she's like in love with
you. How did you miss that?

432
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:42,953
- It's 911. I have to go.
- OK. So go.

433
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:49,810
Is this the part where you
go back to heaven or wherever

434
00:28:49,912 --> 00:28:53,496
and you and your dead guy
friends talk about how great it was

435
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:56,199
that you gave me
this last night together?

436
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:59,703
That I needed it to
grieve and move on?

437
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:02,556
Me and my dead guy friends
mostly talk about sports.

438
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:06,560
- Denny...
- Izzie, go.

439
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,795
I'm not going anywhere.

440
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,090
We're just about ready.

441
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:24,061
- I'm sorry, honey,
for all my crazy.
- Don't be sorry.

442
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:28,432
I love you, even crazy. OK. I've
taken your crap all these years.

443
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:31,835
It's finally time for
you to take mine.

444
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,704
I'm here for my wife, but
it's better for our sex life

445
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:39,076
if I don't see this, so I'll be
here for her down in the lobby.

446
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:49,169
No more spikes. We've
eliminated seizure area.

447
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:51,231
He can finally get a
decent night's sleep.

448
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:53,000
How did he not
know this happened?

449
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,159
Why is it his fault
for not noticing?

450
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,812
Going through life thinking
they had the relationship

451
00:29:58,914 --> 00:30:01,348
where she could talk to
him if she was in trouble.

452
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:05,469
If you really have feelings for
someone, if you really love them,

453
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,322
- then you talk to them.
- Maybe she tried.

454
00:30:09,425 --> 00:30:11,825
We don't know what
went on between them.

455
00:30:11,927 --> 00:30:17,247
Maybe words failed her.
Sometimes, words fail.

456
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:27,791
Your dad won't be out of
surgery for at least another hour.

457
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:30,894
You could have a little nap.

458
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,513
You're 13? You're
hitting the hard stuff?

459
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:36,048
I like the taste.

460
00:30:38,387 --> 00:30:42,489
I was raised by parents who
weren't very interested in having kids.

461
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:47,694
They had friends, they had lives.
They weren't around much at night.

462
00:30:47,796 --> 00:30:51,231
Before I went to bed, I
would turn on all the TVs,

463
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:55,451
every light in the house,
even in the closets.

464
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:59,006
Still couldn't sleep.

465
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:06,997
It's hard to sleep when you don't
feel safe in your own house, isn't it?

466
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:09,065
Yeah.

467
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:13,970
Give me that. You
are going to sleep.

468
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:18,341
- No.
- I'm not taking
no for an answer.

469
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,311
Close your eyes. I'll be here.

470
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,646
Go on.

471
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:25,448
Close your eyes.

472
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:28,384
Close your eyes.

473
00:31:35,844 --> 00:31:37,410
I was sleeping.

474
00:31:37,513 --> 00:31:41,815
And sleep isn't easy for me to
come by, but I was finally sleeping.

475
00:31:41,917 --> 00:31:44,134
- Then I get a call.
- I can't believe it.

476
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:47,804
- I still can't believe it.
- Don't beat yourself up
about it.

477
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:51,291
I've seen a lot of maturity in
you through this whole mess.

478
00:31:51,393 --> 00:31:54,578
You handled the crisis,
you handled the surgery.

479
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,680
You saved that girl's life.

480
00:31:56,782 --> 00:32:00,216
And you called
for help right away.

481
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:04,253
There was a time you would
have reached a different conclusion.

482
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,840
You could've stuck to the
code and saved your own.

483
00:32:06,942 --> 00:32:08,241
Tried to hide the mess.

484
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,378
Sometimes protecting
colleagues is solidarity,

485
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,846
and sometimes it's just hubris.

486
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:16,165
I'm glad to see you
know the difference.

487
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:19,720
Chief... I can't let
you get in trouble.

488
00:32:19,822 --> 00:32:21,521
- Lexie...
- It's not right.

489
00:32:21,623 --> 00:32:24,858
People tried to stop me.
Dr. Yang told me to shut it down,

490
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,227
- but I didn't listen.
- You knew about this yesterday?

491
00:32:28,329 --> 00:32:30,564
- Did you know?
- No.

492
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,116
- You knew.
- No!

493
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:36,319
You knew they were gonna
cut her? Lexie just said you knew!

494
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:40,123
I knew they were doing sutures. I
didn't think I needed to say anything

495
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:43,059
- because I shut it down.
- Apparently, you didn't.

496
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:46,546
Almost cost Lexie her job, not
to mention Sadie almost died!

497
00:32:46,648 --> 00:32:47,998
Sadie did that to herself,

498
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,934
and let's not pretend you
have a relationship with Lexie.

499
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:53,704
- Let's not pretend you care.
- I care about my job!

500
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:56,456
- I care about doing right!
- Who are you to lecture

501
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,226
on doing right? Are you kidding
me? You're not an attending.

502
00:33:00,328 --> 00:33:03,347
- You may be sleeping with one.
- Is that was this is about?

503
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:06,900
- It's always gonna
be about Derek?
- Fine, it's about you and me

504
00:33:07,002 --> 00:33:10,820
- and that you didn't
have my back.
- What did you want me to say?

505
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,939
Anything! You should
have said anything!

506
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:17,443
You have a relationship with the chief,
have his ear, you didn't say anything

507
00:33:17,545 --> 00:33:22,014
to defend me. Because
this isn't just on me.

508
00:33:22,116 --> 00:33:25,986
You stood there and watched him take
me out of the running for solo surgery.

509
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:30,490
You let me take the blame.
We all had interns in that room.

510
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:34,810
We all failed to supervise them.
And if your friend had died in there,

511
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:38,381
if you and I hadn't saved her life,
that would have been on all of us.

512
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:39,982
You should have said that.

513
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,134
- Why are you looking at me?
- We were wondering...

514
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,587
- The interns...
- What you're gonna say to them.

515
00:34:00,689 --> 00:34:05,141
Uh-uh. No. No. I am tired. I'm
not saying anything to the interns.

516
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,427
I raised my babies.
You were my babies.

517
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:11,364
You all are grown. This is on
you. You raise your own babies.

518
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,617
- So we have to talk to them?
- Your babies.

519
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,121
- What do we say?
- Do you need a speech from me?

520
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:21,791
At this point? After this time?
If you do, you shouldn't be here.

521
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:26,078
If you do, I haven't raised you
right. And I know I raised you right.

522
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:31,885
No. You don't get a speech from me.
It's time to make your own speeches.

523
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:48,785
- Dr. Grey, present.
- Sadie Harris, 30,

524
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:52,255
three hours post appendectomy
complicated by hemorrhaging.

525
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:55,241
- Death, what is this?
- Dr. Spalding.

526
00:34:55,343 --> 00:35:00,547
Vitals stable, antibiotic coverage.
She should recover within two weeks.

527
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:06,653
- And?
- And we, your surgeons,

528
00:35:06,755 --> 00:35:09,522
made mistakes that
compromised your care.

529
00:35:09,624 --> 00:35:14,110
Mistakes that reflect poorly on this
hospital and that won't happen again.

530
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:17,163
Effective immediately, every
intern here is on probation.

531
00:35:17,265 --> 00:35:21,585
So much as sneeze,
and you're done.

532
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:24,904
None of you will see the inside
of an OR until further notice.

533
00:35:25,006 --> 00:35:29,709
You've lost the chief's respect, which
believe me, is not an easy thing to get.

534
00:35:29,811 --> 00:35:34,280
Speaking for myself, you've lost
my respect and won't get that back.

535
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,667
- But he still
respects Izzie Stevens.
- What did you say?

536
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:42,505
You still seem to respect Izzie
Stevens and she killed a patient.

537
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:46,276
She was trying to save a man's
life. You almost killed a friend for fun.

538
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,078
It's different.

539
00:35:58,006 --> 00:36:03,243
- How're you doing?
- They give good drugs here.

540
00:36:04,212 --> 00:36:06,646
- Do I look bad?
- You look beautiful.

541
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:09,282
Badge of honor
all over your face.

542
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:16,840
Hey. Did I hear correctly?

543
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:22,828
- That the interns
went scalpel-crazy?
- Yes, you did.

544
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:28,868
- Crazy.
- I don't know
that they were. Crazy.

545
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:32,305
I can remember what
it's like being an intern.

546
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:36,492
Loving medicine. Being
so excited by surgery,

547
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:41,063
wanted to operate so
badly that I'd do anything.

548
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:46,202
That I couldn't stop bouncing up and
down long enough to hold a scalpel.

549
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,104
Now...

550
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:51,574
Now?

551
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:58,815
I can do most of my surgeries
without even thinking about it.

552
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:04,788
Like I'm driving. Suddenly, I'm home.
I don't even know how I got there.

553
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,223
It's rote.

554
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:13,079
I don't even remember most
surgeries. Most of the lives I save.

555
00:37:13,181 --> 00:37:16,799
And the residents,
they work so hard,

556
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:22,688
working like crazy to get to do a
solo surgery that I have come to hate.

557
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:26,876
I hate appys. Appys bore me.

558
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:31,814
I resent the appendix for bothering
to get hot and needing to come out.

559
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,484
I resent an organ.

560
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,121
I don't know.

561
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:40,923
Maybe I don't want to do
general surgery after all.

562
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:44,294
Maybe I need a new challenge.
Maybe I need something to make me

563
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:49,265
bounce up and down.
Maybe I'm just tired.

564
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:55,538
- It's OK... to be tired.
- Hmm.

565
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:57,974
Right?

566
00:37:59,894 --> 00:38:04,147
- You're tired, too.
- I'm exhausted.

567
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:08,618
Deep down inside exhausted.

568
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:11,554
I just... I want...

569
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,609
I don't know.

570
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:19,879
But I want something.

571
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:24,000
Well, that makes two of us.

572
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:31,107
<i>Sleep. It's the
easiest thing to do.</i>

573
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:32,942
<i>You just...</i>

574
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:36,680
<i>close your eyes.</i>

575
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:45,921
OK, fine. The surgery
was a bad idea.

576
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:50,843
No, it was a terrible idea. Speaking
as your boss, it was an irresponsible

577
00:38:50,946 --> 00:38:53,813
and reckless idea that
makes me question if you have

578
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,449
- what it takes
to be a good doctor.
- Death...

579
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:58,585
As your friend...

580
00:38:59,955 --> 00:39:02,255
what the hell is
going on with you?

581
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:07,827
I don't know.

582
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:10,529
<i>But for so many of us,</i>

583
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:13,532
<i>sleep seems out of our grasp.</i>

584
00:39:17,305 --> 00:39:18,805
Thank you.

585
00:39:18,907 --> 00:39:21,257
Your mom used to
see how tired I was.

586
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,628
She used to make you bring me home
'cause I was alone and needed family.

587
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:28,280
That was a good thing.

588
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,000
So either you bring
her home or I will.

589
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:42,194
<i>We want it, but we
don't know how to get it.</i>

590
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:53,206
I don't know why I came here.

591
00:39:59,214 --> 00:40:01,364
- Do you want to come in?
- No.

592
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:04,651
I don't think that
would be appropriate.

593
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,988
Do you want to go
someplace else?

594
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,208
No.

595
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:32,962
I think you're beautiful.

596
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:42,338
<i>But once we face our
demons, face our fears...</i>

597
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:54,317
- Hey. Lexie's here.
- Hey.

598
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:57,320
- Yeah.
- Are you making up
a bed for her?

599
00:40:57,405 --> 00:41:01,891
- Yeah.
- You brought home a stray.

600
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:03,376
Yeah.

601
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,463
<i>And turn to each other for help.</i>

602
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:09,142
I'm gonna try to get some sleep.

603
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,734
I gotta be back at the
hospital in six hours.

604
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:16,706
Alex, wait...

605
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,375
I'm a mess.

606
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,312
I'm a flat-out freaking
mess. I know that. I know.

607
00:41:22,414 --> 00:41:25,664
And I'm sorry.

608
00:41:25,766 --> 00:41:28,901
- You deserve a lot...
- Stop.

609
00:41:29,003 --> 00:41:33,872
If you don't want to be with me,
if this is too much for you now,

610
00:41:33,975 --> 00:41:35,942
it's OK.

611
00:41:36,044 --> 00:41:39,578
But you're gonna have to break
up with me. I'm not going anywhere.

612
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,133
I can handle the
mess. So it's up to you.

613
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,471
You coming?

614
00:42:01,702 --> 00:42:03,319
I'm sorry.

615
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,755
I can't...

616
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,724
It's OK.

617
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,710
I will be right here.

618
00:42:11,179 --> 00:42:13,079
It's OK.

619
00:42:13,181 --> 00:42:16,816
<i>Night-time isn't
so scary because...</i>

620
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:22,104
<i>we realize we aren't
all alone in the dark.</i>
