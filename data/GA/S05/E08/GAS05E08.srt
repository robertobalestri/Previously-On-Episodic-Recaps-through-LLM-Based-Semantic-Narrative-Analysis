1
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:08,640
<i>It's intense, what
happens in the OR...</i>

2
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,542
<i>when lives are on the line</i>

3
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:13,879
<i>and you're poking at
brains like they're Silly Putty.</i>

4
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:21,153
<i>You form a bond with the
surgeons right next to you.</i>

5
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:26,225
<i>An unbreakable,
indescribable bond.</i>

6
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,995
<i>It's intimate, being
tied together like that.</i>

7
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:32,075
You up?

8
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,443
- No.
- Yes.

9
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:34,799
<i>Whether you like it or not,</i>

10
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:37,069
<i>whether you like them
or not, you become family.</i>

11
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:41,757
- The Wicked Witch is dead.
- Metaphorically dead,
or dead dead?

12
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:45,160
- Who are we talking about?
- Hahn.

13
00:00:45,262 --> 00:00:46,857
Her name is off
the surgical board.

14
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:48,859
Her surgeries have
been canceled.

15
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:52,250
I don't know how or why,
but I do know Hahn is gone.

16
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,852
It's too bad. She
was really talented.

17
00:00:57,608 --> 00:01:00,259
- You're not talking to me.
- Mm-mmm.

18
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:07,048
<i>♪ But I'd rather be dead ♪</i>

19
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:10,452
<i>- ♪ My patience is fleeting ♪
- ♪ I'd rather be dead ♪</i>

20
00:01:10,554 --> 00:01:13,371
- Hi. Is Grey home?
- Hi.

21
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:15,007
Yes.

22
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:18,593
Death! Come on,
where are you, Death?

23
00:01:18,695 --> 00:01:20,946
- Death!
- Die!

24
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:24,416
- Oh, my God, it's been...
- Forever.

25
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:26,452
- You look like...
- You look like...

26
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:28,387
Death!

27
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:31,807
The guy in the pajamas your
boyfriend? 'Cause if so, then hot.

28
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:33,459
- Right?
- Hey.

29
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:37,078
- Uh... Who are you?
- I'm Sadie. Who are you?

30
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,347
I'm Cristina.

31
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:42,801
Wow.

32
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:49,074
Apparently they went backpacking
around Europe or something.

33
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,425
Before med school.

34
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,622
That woman all but
kicked me out of the bed.

35
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,246
That's terrible.

36
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:57,548
And Death? Meredith's
name is not Death, it's Mer.

37
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,018
I really feel for you.

38
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,320
She's never even
mentioned this woman.

39
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:03,783
How good of a friend can she be?

40
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:06,257
Good enough to kick
us both out of bed.

41
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,795
Welcome to my world.

42
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,432
<i>♪ Can we stop? ♪</i>

43
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:19,549
This woman is the reason I went
to med school in the first place.

44
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:23,708
I figured if a slacker like Death could
handle slicing people open, I could too.

45
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,361
- Meredith's not a slacker.
- I could tell you some stories.

46
00:02:26,463 --> 00:02:27,846
But you won't.

47
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,966
Sadie, you postponed your
residency to work in a morgue?

48
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,602
Yeah. All the fun
cutting, none of the rules.

49
00:02:33,704 --> 00:02:36,888
But I got bored, started
craving blood that was flowing.

50
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,507
And now you're here. I
can't believe you're here.

51
00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:41,209
Yay.

52
00:02:42,112 --> 00:02:44,012
Iz, you coming?

53
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:46,381
- Yeah. I just need a minute.
- I get it.

54
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:50,669
Hahn's case brought up the Denny
thing, but Hahn's not even here anymore.

55
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,104
It's stuff from the past.

56
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,306
Stuff from the past, Iz.

57
00:02:56,743 --> 00:03:00,846
- You don't understand.
- I might, if you talk to me.

58
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,716
Fine.

59
00:03:08,572 --> 00:03:10,388
See you inside.

60
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:19,225
- I'm walking.
- Good morning.

61
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:22,684
- Walking straight ahead,
all by myself.
- You look good.

62
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,285
Tired, but good.

63
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:26,621
Did I mention I find the
short hair kind of sassy?

64
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:30,141
Now I'm turning this
corner. Again, all alone.

65
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,513
Ow!

66
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:39,968
Um... These are
scratches from my kitten.

67
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,621
He's a crazy scratchy scratcher.

68
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,206
- You're a cat person?
- I meant hairbrush.

69
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,742
I have a crazy
scratchy hairbrush.

70
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:49,995
Solo surgeries are
at stake here, Three.

71
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,897
I can't have you acting weird.

72
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:55,717
- Or wounded.
- I'm on top of my game, really.

73
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,221
I'm sending you to Plastics,
far, far away. Just go.

74
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,810
What do you know about
a heart guy named Dixon?

75
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,995
Dixon? No, not a guy.
I've heard of Virginia Dixon.

76
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:11,032
Got an incredible record,
really low mortality...

77
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:13,534
- Wait, is she coming here?
- Yeah, today.

78
00:04:13,636 --> 00:04:16,437
Piggyback heart
transplant. I'm on the case.

79
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:19,925
What? Why am I not on the case?

80
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,712
So she's your
pre-Cristina Cristina?

81
00:04:23,814 --> 00:04:26,092
You're gonna tell me
why she calls you Death?

82
00:04:26,116 --> 00:04:28,883
The adventures of Death
and Die are better left untold.

83
00:04:28,985 --> 00:04:30,935
Pedia's julienning
her little arms.

84
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,955
No word on what made H hitch
a ride with the flying monkeys.

85
00:04:34,057 --> 00:04:36,825
- Translate that for me.
- Lexie may be a secret cutter.

86
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:39,778
- Still no word
on why Hahn quit.
- That true about Lexie?

87
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,760
- I don't know.
- What are you gonna do?

88
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:43,698
- Nothing.
- You can't do nothing.

89
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,717
- She's your sister.
- And?

90
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,236
- And your family.
- I'm not understanding.

91
00:04:48,338 --> 00:04:50,589
Lexie's your family.

92
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:54,275
Forget it.

93
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:04,102
- Hello, Dr. Hunt.
- Dr. Yang.

94
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:05,971
Thank you.

95
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,557
- What do we got?
- Crush injuries.

96
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:12,911
- Couple minutes out.
- What do you know about Hahn?

97
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,613
- She's gone.
- Yeah, but why?

98
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:16,881
I don't know.

99
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,401
- You two are friends.
- I don't want to talk about it.

100
00:05:19,503 --> 00:05:21,447
I want blood and guts
and mangled bones.

101
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:23,921
I want a guy so smashed
up it takes all day to fix.

102
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:28,092
I want to rock a surgery. I
don't want to talk about Hahn.

103
00:05:31,148 --> 00:05:34,098
Unidentified man with
prolonged extrication time.

104
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,802
Had to fish him out of a garbage
truck. Multiple crush injuries,

105
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,455
open fractures, GCS
three, couldn't unhook him.

106
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:42,924
- Unhook him?
- His femur's broken in half

107
00:05:43,026 --> 00:05:45,944
and is puncturing his
torso. He's impaled.

108
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:51,416
- Impaled on himself?
- Human pretzel.

109
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,402
That'll do.

110
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,996
- Wow.
- Check his popliteal pulse.

111
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,832
- I'm getting nothing.
- 'Cause his knee's over here.

112
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:10,985
Sleeping in the Dumpster and
they started crushing the trash?

113
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:13,738
- That's a bad day.
- I'm here. What did I miss?

114
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,868
Your first day. Stand
back and shut up.

115
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:18,994
Breath sounds are clear and
equal. Both sides. Unbelievable.

116
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:22,063
No punctured lung. We need a
portable X-ray and an ultrasound.

117
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:23,592
- Someone page us?
- I did.

118
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,816
- You did? That's a first.
- So's this.

119
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:29,020
I've seen guys cut in half,
amputations, eviscerations,

120
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,682
but I've never seen
anything like this.

121
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,042
I wondered if you could help.

122
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:38,129
You hire when you're
number one, not number 12.

123
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,866
But I need you to be
my ambassador today.

124
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,568
Show Dr. Dixon what
Seattle Grace is all about.

125
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,672
I've thrown a lot of money, big title
and a lot of research dollars at her,

126
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:50,709
- but...
- But what?

127
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,847
She's a little different.
She's a little off.

128
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,381
So we're wooing today, Bailey.

129
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,161
I can woo with the best of 'em.

130
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:02,169
- So, what, Dixon's a nutjob?
- Excuse me?

131
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:04,856
I've already had my
quota of crazy for the year.

132
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,524
I've had my off days.
Wanna judge me?

133
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,593
You never even met the woman.

134
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:12,280
Now you heard the chief, our
job is to impress Dr. Dixon today,

135
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:15,233
- so be impressive.
- I've got the chart
for Dr. Dixon.

136
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:17,229
I'm ready to work. I'm excited.

137
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:19,871
- Don't be. She's off.
- Karev.

138
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:24,425
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

139
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,095
Heads up. Here she comes.

140
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,267
Dr. Dixon. Hi.

141
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:37,005
Welcome to Seattle Grace.
We're very happy to have you here.

142
00:07:37,107 --> 00:07:40,391
- I'm Dr. Bailey.
- I brought
my own lab coat.

143
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:44,095
I'm here to perform a heart
transplant today. I do hearts.

144
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:48,733
A procedure invented by Christiaan
Barnard in 1967. I do hearts.

145
00:07:50,987 --> 00:07:53,922
Uh... I'm Dr. Webber.
We spoke on the phone.

146
00:07:54,024 --> 00:07:56,407
Karev, get Dr. Dixon
the latest labs.

147
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,010
Stevens, let's prep
the patient, please.

148
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:08,069
OK, then, she's a little off.

149
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,724
His femur's in pieces. Except
the part stuck in his torso.

150
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:13,958
No way I'm saving that leg.

151
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:16,360
Impaled piece is
lodged under his clavicle.

152
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:19,130
C-spine looks clear.
Without a CT, hard to be sure.

153
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:22,634
- Why can't we get a CT scan?
- Way he's impaled,
no clear reading.

154
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,285
A stupid question.

155
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:27,439
A limited window. With vitals
like these in a few hours...

156
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,390
Won't be able to
withstand surgery.

157
00:08:29,492 --> 00:08:31,175
Good thing he's unconscious.

158
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,528
Can't do anything till we dislodge
the femur from his clavicle.

159
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,047
Let's un-impale him.

160
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,466
Yang, Grey, new kid, hold
his shoulders. Brace hard.

161
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:40,688
- I'll hold his C-spine.
- I got his torso.

162
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:43,037
I need to guide
posterior hip dislocation.

163
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:46,341
Second that leg is out be ready
to assert pressure, stop bleeding.

164
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,309
Better than working
on corpses, huh?

165
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:53,982
On the count of
three. One... two...

166
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:56,100
Three!

167
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,039
Femur's really wedged in...

168
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,358
OK, almost there. Steady.

169
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,178
Just a little bit further. Sloan, I need
you to rotate his knee to my right...

170
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:12,566
- Push ten of morphine now!
- Stop! Stop!

171
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,694
Corpses don't do that.

172
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,689
- I need you to calm down, sir.
- What are you doing to me?

173
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,158
Can you tell us your name?

174
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,161
Get out of my face and your
hands off! You're hurting me!

175
00:09:40,263 --> 00:09:42,330
Do as he says.
Hands off, everybody.

176
00:09:42,432 --> 00:09:43,782
Hands off!

177
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,487
Thank you.

178
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,907
- What's your name?
- Timothy Miller.

179
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,310
Mr. Miller, we need
to get you into surgery.

180
00:09:55,412 --> 00:09:57,762
I'm gonna be
able to walk, right?

181
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:59,831
We're trying to keep you alive.

182
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:06,754
Our cardiac wing is extensive

183
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,867
and well-equipped with all...

184
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:13,177
The first successful heart transplant
was performed on September 7, 1896,

185
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,047
by Dr. Ludwig Rehn,
Frankfurt, Germany.

186
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,393
OK.

187
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,261
Excuse me, I don't
mean to interrupt.

188
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,720
Please... I mean, just...

189
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,355
Please update
Dr. Dixon on the patient.

190
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:27,542
Dr. Stevens is prepping your
transplant patient for surgery.

191
00:10:27,644 --> 00:10:30,094
They scheduled a
transplant six years ago,

192
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:31,477
but the heart was too small.

193
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,215
They added a donor heart
to help his own heart function.

194
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:38,269
- They did a piggyback...
- Heterotopic transplant.

195
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:40,671
Piggyback is the colloquial
name for the procedure.

196
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,173
Don't do that.

197
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,876
Don't do that.

198
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:52,851
How about we take
you to meet the patient?

199
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:57,538
They told me my heart belonged to a girl
hit by a car while she was hitchhiking.

200
00:10:57,641 --> 00:11:00,742
And now when I'm driving, I
see hitchhikers all the time.

201
00:11:00,843 --> 00:11:02,377
Always up ahead, just up ahead.

202
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:04,279
When I get up
ahead they're gone.

203
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:06,024
You're not buying this, are you?

204
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:08,066
I should never have
gotten the heart.

205
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,168
- I don't understand...
- Navajos, we don't
touch the dead,

206
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,120
don't touch their
bodies or belongings,

207
00:11:13,222 --> 00:11:14,739
the spirit clings there.

208
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:18,342
So to have part of a dead
body sewed into my chest is...

209
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:23,064
My friends, who
follow the old ways,

210
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,482
they begged me not to do it.

211
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:27,085
- I should've listened.
- Sorry, I don't understand.

212
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,821
You think you're haunted by
your transplanted heart, but

213
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,850
you're here for
a new transplant.

214
00:11:31,874 --> 00:11:34,592
No! That's what I'm trying
to tell you. I don't want it!

215
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,361
I don't want the new one. I
want you to take the old one out.

216
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:41,516
OK, that's just plain stupid. Take
the heart, man. Take it if they offer it.

217
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,285
Did he just say he doesn't
want the donor heart?

218
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:46,954
- Yes, ma'am.
- - Clay Bedonie, are you aware

219
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:50,275
without a new heart you'll live a
short life attached to a machine

220
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,877
before dying a sudden
and agonizing death?

221
00:11:55,164 --> 00:11:57,749
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

222
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:02,554
Five parallel pulley
stitches per cut, then switch.

223
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,606
- Are you sure I'm numb?
- Toughen up.

224
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:07,308
When one of our residents
gets picked for the solo surgery,

225
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,421
one of us gets to scrub in.

226
00:12:09,445 --> 00:12:11,306
We have a goal here.
Focus on the goal.

227
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,847
Solo surgeries,
totally worth it.

228
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:15,383
Solo surgeries,
totally worth it.

229
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:19,470
Hello. I need someone
to run these labs

230
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,489
and pull these X-rays, please.

231
00:12:21,591 --> 00:12:23,324
Will do.

232
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:27,295
This looks like a cool place to
hang out. What are you doing?

233
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:30,398
This is for interns, it's our
hangout. Go find your own.

234
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,168
Sorry.

235
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:41,242
Solo surgeries.
Totally worth it.

236
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:44,045
I won't live if I can't walk.

237
00:12:44,147 --> 00:12:48,499
- We'll do our best to save the leg.
- - I'm homeless.

238
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,337
Walking is how I survive, it's
how I get from one day to the next.

239
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,550
Marion Street's safe
from 2:00 to 6:00am,

240
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,941
and then I go over
to Hadley Bridge

241
00:12:57,043 --> 00:13:00,044
and I hang there till
6:30 until the traffic hits.

242
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:01,896
And then I go over to Belltown,

243
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:03,681
and I hang out over
at the waterfront.

244
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,000
And then the
waterfront, if it's trouble,

245
00:13:06,102 --> 00:13:11,272
then I go back to 4th Street.
I'm homeless. I can't not walk!

246
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:15,009
I... What am I gonna
do? What am I gonna do?

247
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:17,929
Your injuries are critical. If
we don't get you to surgery...

248
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:20,481
Will your surgery make me walk?

249
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:22,916
Huh?

250
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,238
Then I don't want it!

251
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:30,375
OK. All right.

252
00:13:33,263 --> 00:13:36,147
You heard the man.
The surgery's off.

253
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:47,107
I appreciate you trying to advise
me to do what you think is best.

254
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:49,844
- These are facts, not opinions.
- What I'm saying is...

255
00:13:49,946 --> 00:13:53,314
He's trying to say he'd rather
live a shorter life unhaunted

256
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,566
than a longer one that is.

257
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,672
I'm not saying I
agree, I'm just...

258
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,125
I'm just gonna stand over here.

259
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:07,962
That was a good idea.

260
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:11,215
The heart that you take out
of me, what happens to it?

261
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:14,151
It goes from the OR to
pathology to medical waste.

262
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:16,620
I need that heart
back, for a ritual.

263
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:19,540
We have laws. There
are rules. Rules are rules.

264
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:22,343
Maybe there's a
compromise to be made here.

265
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,623
We could, I don't know,

266
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:27,782
give him back the old
heart to do the ritual,

267
00:14:27,884 --> 00:14:32,069
then give him a chance to
live by putting the new heart in.

268
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,565
- No.
- No.

269
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:37,124
- Doesn't work that way.
- I'd still be haunted.

270
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:38,743
Just by a new ghost.

271
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:43,047
There are rules. We have laws
and rules are rules and laws are laws.

272
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,382
No.

273
00:14:56,012 --> 00:14:58,746
So that's it? No surgery,
you're just gonna walk away.

274
00:14:58,848 --> 00:15:01,048
I'm respecting the
patient's wishes.

275
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,478
Patient's unstable
with an open wound.

276
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,168
Which we are packing.

277
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,770
- This guy's circling the drain.
- You cannot walk away.

278
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,250
Don't tell me how to
run things in my ER.

279
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,290
- Your ER?
- We save lives here.

280
00:15:10,393 --> 00:15:13,678
We don't just patch up
patients and leave them to die.

281
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:18,282
If you can't handle that,
go back to the desert

282
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,685
and leave us
here to do our jobs.

283
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,545
Dr. Torres, please tell me...

284
00:15:31,647 --> 00:15:35,149
you could figure out some
way to build this man some legs.

285
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:46,544
The right femur's toast. So's
the hip and half the pelvis,

286
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:50,731
but if I put some pins here,
and maybe a plate here...

287
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,178
I mean, there are some
viable bone fragments.

288
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,503
Not starting from nothing.
What do you think?

289
00:15:55,605 --> 00:15:58,038
- I think it's wild.
- She wasn't talking to you.

290
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,852
It's her first day.
Could you not...

291
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,743
She needs to learn her place.

292
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:03,394
I think it's a lot of hardware.

293
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,413
What the guy needs
is a whole new leg.

294
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,634
Maybe I can do that.
Yeah, it's kind of a puzzle.

295
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,799
I just need to figure out what
equipment I need and how to pull it off.

296
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:17,675
- Like Lincoln Logs.
- A little more high-tech
than that.

297
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,488
It's exactly like Lincoln Logs.

298
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:22,746
I need you guys to grab every
piece of titanium we've got.

299
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:24,515
OK.

300
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:29,820
I need the hospital
rules to specify the fact

301
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:33,991
that we must respect all religious
and spiritual beliefs of our patients.

302
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:38,245
- The rules?
- I'm asking you
to declare a rule

303
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:39,747
of our department.

304
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:42,166
That we respect the
beliefs of our patients?

305
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,701
- Yes.
- Isn't that common courtesy?

306
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:47,789
- Yes.
- Then why am I declaring it?

307
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:52,776
Um... Dr. Dixon doesn't
do common courtesy,

308
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:56,864
but she understands rules.
So if it's a rule, we're golden.

309
00:16:56,966 --> 00:16:59,734
If not, we have a
pissed off patient,

310
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:01,201
an apoplectic surgeon,

311
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:04,472
and none of those things
makes for a successful procedure

312
00:17:04,574 --> 00:17:06,857
on a faulty heart.

313
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,777
Not to mention
the failure to woo.

314
00:17:11,547 --> 00:17:13,447
You want me to
announce it as a rule?

315
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:16,284
I'm here as a witness. You
can raise your right hand,

316
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:19,370
put your left one on the
<i>Physicians' Desk Reference.</i>

317
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,791
- It's a rule.
- Thank you.

318
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:29,514
Dr. Dixon? I'm Cristina
Yang. I'm a resident.

319
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:32,116
Been focused on cardio
since I began my internship.

320
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,817
I'm certainly
looking forward to...

321
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,687
Were the other ones
taken off my case?

322
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:40,340
- What other ones?
- The black one, the male one,

323
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:43,777
the one with yellow hair.

324
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,864
- Not that I'm aware of.
- Then why are you
talking to me?

325
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:04,297
What happened to Hahn? Whatever
made Hahn leave it can be fixed.

326
00:18:05,868 --> 00:18:08,102
Unless she was... She
wasn't fired, was she?

327
00:18:08,204 --> 00:18:10,204
- Not coming back.
- You don't know that.

328
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,096
- She kind of does.
- How?

329
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,308
Because she doesn't...

330
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,727
Look, it's just too...

331
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,014
We had a fight.

332
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:23,134
Oh, please. Meredith
and I fight all the time.

333
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,902
We still work together.

334
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:28,172
It's not like Hahn was
your girlfriend or something.

335
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:38,483
Oh, my God. She
was your girlfriend?

336
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:41,819
We hadn't... figured it all out.

337
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,207
- So are you a lesbian now?
- I don't know.

338
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:50,495
Maybe you were a "oncebian?"

339
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:54,198
Or a "twicebian."
Whatever. It's over.

340
00:18:55,585 --> 00:18:58,819
- Are you OK?
- She's fine. Leave her alone.

341
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,243
I hit the titanium mother lode.

342
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:07,161
- Hi.
- Hey.

343
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:11,615
Oh, come on, really?

344
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,303
Hey, Lexie. How are you?

345
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,440
- Is everything going OK?
- Did somebody say something?

346
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:23,210
- I was doing something?
- No, I'm asking as a person

347
00:19:23,312 --> 00:19:26,197
who's sort of related to you if
there's anything bothering you.

348
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:30,201
This is not as a boss or resident or
superior who keeps an eye on what I do?

349
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,970
No, I'm a compassionate
person. I'm just wondering

350
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:36,590
if you're channeling your
tragic pain into self-mutilation.

351
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,577
- Are you a secret cutter?
- No!

352
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,130
Little Grey, Torres is
trying to set a world record

353
00:19:43,232 --> 00:19:46,684
for most titanium rods
used in one patient. You in?

354
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:49,803
- Little Grey?
- Little Grey, Big Grey.

355
00:19:49,905 --> 00:19:52,056
It's how I tell you two apart.

356
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:54,575
Yeah, I'm in. I'll
just be a minute.

357
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:04,251
Can't you people let
a guy die in peace?

358
00:20:04,353 --> 00:20:06,571
Your vitals are slipping.

359
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,756
I'm not gonna lie to
you, that's not good.

360
00:20:08,858 --> 00:20:13,678
- I've been through worse.
- Yeah. I imagine you have.

361
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,563
Oh... Don't get like that.

362
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:20,884
Don't look at me like
I'm some tragic hero...

363
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,737
with a secret past.

364
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,822
You have a story.

365
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:27,224
We all have a story.

366
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:34,798
I took a turn, with my
life, and I couldn't connect.

367
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:37,985
I lost.

368
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:42,923
I couldn't connect.

369
00:20:44,694 --> 00:20:47,811
My life, it took a turn and...

370
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:55,252
I just couldn't turn it back.

371
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,728
Guys, we need to shut
down for a few days.

372
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,707
People are starting
to get suspicious.

373
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:08,231
I was accused of
being a secret cutter.

374
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:10,451
So wear long sleeves.

375
00:21:10,553 --> 00:21:13,770
I didn't realize we were
inviting more people here.

376
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:17,207
Are you kidding? A
secret intern society?

377
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,042
I'm all over that.

378
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,845
Well, I still think we
need to take fewer risks.

379
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,715
Fewer risks? Come on,
you got a guard at the door.

380
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:27,484
You're using more local
anesthetic for three sutures

381
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,732
than you would
upstairs for a chest tube.

382
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:32,756
Look, I get that you're doing
all this to learn new skills,

383
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,659
but you'll only learn so
much by being careful.

384
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:39,579
Actually, I would disagree. I
think the only safe way to...

385
00:21:48,925 --> 00:21:50,641
Ouch.

386
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:57,230
Who wants to stitch me up?

387
00:21:57,332 --> 00:21:59,066
Oh, right here.

388
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,135
You gonna tell me
about Death and Die?

389
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,025
Nope, but I did
talk to Lexie for you.

390
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:11,695
- I need you to do
something for me.
- What?

391
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:14,209
Tell Mark to keep his Little
Sloan out of Little Grey.

392
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:17,868
- Is he hitting on you?
- No! Not my little Grey,
Lexie's.

393
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:22,573
The last thing she needs is
Sloan going man-whore on her.

394
00:22:22,658 --> 00:22:25,242
So you need to tell him to
step away from Little Grey.

395
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:29,046
- I'll see what I can do.
- Little Grey, Derek. Little Grey.

396
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,241
Did she, uh...

397
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,845
- Did she say goodbye to you?
- Nope.

398
00:22:46,415 --> 00:22:50,217
- You OK?
- Do I look OK?

399
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:53,304
You look great.

400
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:56,540
Then I'm OK.

401
00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:07,267
So, there's a nine-day
ritual to undo a haunting?

402
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:09,536
It starts with a
nine-day ritual.

403
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,807
Are you really gonna
waste nine days on this?

404
00:23:14,777 --> 00:23:16,087
- Dr. Stevens...
- Yes?

405
00:23:16,111 --> 00:23:19,029
Why are you so
interested in my haunting?

406
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,135
Can ghosts do things?

407
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,654
I mean, can they make
things happen in your life?

408
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:30,523
I've had two cases,
two patients in a row

409
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:34,295
that have really reminded
me of my dead fiancé.

410
00:23:34,397 --> 00:23:36,780
Heart transplants and LVADs.

411
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:40,000
Could he be doing that? Could
he be bringing them to me?

412
00:23:40,102 --> 00:23:42,703
Izzie, come on.

413
00:23:42,805 --> 00:23:45,639
Is he here right
now, your ghost?

414
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,294
I... I hate to ask, but...

415
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:52,863
Oh...

416
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,473
You don't want
me in your surgery.

417
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:59,036
Not that I think there's
something wrong with you,

418
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:03,039
it's just... I don't need extra
ghosts in my operating room.

419
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:14,535
- Mr. Miller...
- What does a guy have to do

420
00:24:14,637 --> 00:24:16,998
to get a little peace
and quiet around here?

421
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:20,673
The fatigue you're feeling is from
blood loss, queasiness, dizziness.

422
00:24:20,776 --> 00:24:22,659
You're slowly bleeding to death.

423
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,746
- What, you trying to scare him?
- No.

424
00:24:25,848 --> 00:24:29,383
I'm trying to ascertain whether
he's suicidal or just defeated.

425
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:37,920
Mr. Miller, you
survive on the streets,

426
00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:39,320
so I know you're a fighter.

427
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:42,846
That doesn't make me a
fighter. Makes me lucky.

428
00:24:42,932 --> 00:24:45,599
How long have you been
out there, ten years, 20?

429
00:24:45,701 --> 00:24:49,169
You're not in jail, not dead.
That's not luck. You're smart.

430
00:24:49,272 --> 00:24:52,806
You gotta be smart to take
care of yourself on your own.

431
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:55,826
I guess.

432
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:59,413
This, what you're doing
right now, Mr. Miller,

433
00:24:59,515 --> 00:25:02,866
refusing surgery,
it's not smart.

434
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,970
There's a rehab center
not too far from here.

435
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:09,773
Medicare takes care of
it. You could stay there.

436
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,025
Food, bed, long as you need.

437
00:25:13,862 --> 00:25:15,528
Just let us operate.

438
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,883
Let us operate, and
we'll figure the rest out.

439
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:36,817
Wow. That's the fastest I've ever
seen anyone dissect through adhesions.

440
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,555
Dr. Dixon, there
is a rule regarding

441
00:25:41,657 --> 00:25:44,758
giving medical
waste to the patient.

442
00:25:45,594 --> 00:25:48,245
- Dr. Dixon?
- Huh... What?

443
00:25:49,531 --> 00:25:51,715
I was just saying
there's a rule,

444
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:54,484
an official, very,
very specific rule,

445
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:59,006
that, in the event a
patient asks for their organ

446
00:25:59,108 --> 00:26:01,336
or body part back,
for any reason

447
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,361
related to or involving
their cultural beliefs,

448
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:09,916
we must respect
that patient's wishes

449
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:13,003
and return that
organ to the patient.

450
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:16,707
That is the rule I
forgot to tell you about.

451
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,809
If I went down to
pathology right now,

452
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,177
would they know about the rule?

453
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,996
The chief would
know. It's his rule.

454
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:25,899
He declared it. Rule's a rule.

455
00:26:29,322 --> 00:26:35,208
Dr. Karev, make sure that
we follow the chief's rule

456
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:38,478
and return the heart to
the patient after the surgery.

457
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,499
I'm going back to
work now. Clamp.

458
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:52,259
What the hell is that gooey
thing they're taking out of him?

459
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:57,547
Oh, the silent treatment.

460
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,617
OK, if you're gonna
be that way I'll just, uh...

461
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:04,521
I'll just stand
here and be quiet.

462
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,445
OK, that, that is disgusting.

463
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,424
I thought you were
gonna be quiet.

464
00:27:13,448 --> 00:27:16,399
You know you're acting like
you don't want me to be here.

465
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:20,003
You know what I've wished
for every day since you died?

466
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:26,610
I've wished that I
could see you again.

467
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:30,814
I'd have given anything just
to see you one more time.

468
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:35,802
Looking at you and
knowing that I can't touch you,

469
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,271
it's hurting me.

470
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:43,193
- Izzie, you can touch me.
- You're not real.

471
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:47,531
You can't be real, so
that means that I'm sick

472
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:52,452
or something is wrong with
me and I can't hope for that.

473
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,890
I can't hope...

474
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:01,962
You're not real.

475
00:28:02,064 --> 00:28:04,647
Izzie, I am as real as you

476
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,051
or that gooey, disgusting
thing down there.

477
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,256
Touch me.

478
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:24,584
Izzie... touch me.

479
00:28:24,686 --> 00:28:27,137
- I'll prove it to you.
- No!

480
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:30,874
Why are you here? Why?

481
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,330
I am here for
you, Izzie Stevens.

482
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:45,222
<i>Clamp.</i>

483
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:50,811
OK, that's it. The
donor heart is separated.

484
00:28:50,913 --> 00:28:52,840
We have the cannulas
ready for bypass.

485
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,614
Next step is the LVAD.

486
00:28:54,716 --> 00:28:57,384
Wait, what is that?

487
00:29:00,889 --> 00:29:05,091
That's not right. That
can't be happening.

488
00:29:05,194 --> 00:29:07,878
Heart's beating. How's his
heart beating on its own?

489
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,515
It can't be happening. It
shouldn't be happening.

490
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:13,884
The heart is beating.

491
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,580
Heart is beating, it
shouldn't be beating.

492
00:29:15,604 --> 00:29:17,604
It shouldn't be beating.

493
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:28,565
I've never seen a
reconstruction like this.

494
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:31,818
Never done one like this.
Here's hoping it works.

495
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,054
Ready for the rod. How
are you guys doing?

496
00:29:35,156 --> 00:29:37,657
Hemorrhaging bleeding
through the packing.

497
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:40,310
- Try the fibrin sealant.
- Good call.

498
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:42,824
- How are you doing?
- - Good, moving to the next lac.

499
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:45,088
Finished already? Let me see.

500
00:29:45,901 --> 00:29:47,234
Wow.

501
00:29:47,336 --> 00:29:51,788
- Pulley stitches. Nicely done.
- Thank you, Dr. Sloan.

502
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,862
- So my heart?
- - Started beating by itself.

503
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,176
If it continues to
function like this

504
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,767
you won't need an LVAD
or any kind of machinery.

505
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:05,519
It's wonderful news.

506
00:30:05,621 --> 00:30:11,274
- It's very atypical.
- Not for me. I'm finally free.

507
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,393
I'm not haunted anymore.

508
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:15,111
Your heart had
six years to rest,

509
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:17,481
probably enough time
for it to repair itself,

510
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:20,717
which is why it started beating
again. Never seen this before.

511
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,619
Read about it but
never seen it before.

512
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:25,621
You have your
beliefs, I have mine.

513
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,326
I don't have beliefs,
I have science.

514
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:32,406
Science is a belief,

515
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:36,199
a belief in only what
you can see and touch.

516
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,418
I believe in more.

517
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:45,142
Just thought I'd stop in to
see how everything's going.

518
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:48,528
I'm still several hours
away, but I may pull this off.

519
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,564
Rebuilding a man's
skeleton from scratch.

520
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:55,618
And we just found out that Dr. Grey
here can out-pulley stitch Shepherd.

521
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,322
I wouldn't go so
far as to say that.

522
00:30:58,424 --> 00:30:59,939
Excellent job, Dr. Grey.

523
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:03,410
- Excellent job of teaching,
Dr. Yang.
- Sir?

524
00:31:03,512 --> 00:31:07,247
Taking time to teach your interns
and they retain the knowledge.

525
00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:09,699
Haven't made my decision
yet on the solo surgery,

526
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,819
but keep teaching like that
and you're my one to watch.

527
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,355
Thank you, sir.

528
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:19,837
- V-fib.
- Start CPR.

529
00:31:19,861 --> 00:31:23,329
Push one of epi and
charge the paddles to 360.

530
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,532
Clear.

533
00:31:35,877 --> 00:31:39,379
So what do you do now with
the haunted piece? Bury it or...?

534
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:45,401
Burn it. Actually, my tribe's
medicine man will burn it.

535
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:47,837
I'm not allowed to
even touch the smoke.

536
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,391
So the not-touching thing, does
that apply to just the flesh or...?

537
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,671
No, we don't touch
their belongings.

538
00:31:53,695 --> 00:31:58,148
We can cleanse jewelry, metals,
but fabric, bedding, clothes,

539
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:02,485
books that were owned by
the dead, we burn all of it.

540
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:06,823
The spirit can
cling to any of it.

541
00:32:09,577 --> 00:32:14,014
Oh, no. Your ghost.

542
00:32:14,116 --> 00:32:16,361

I did my part, I
built his bones.

552
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,535
I built his bones from scratch,

553
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:57,874
and you, all of you, you were
supposed to keep him alive.

554
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:00,927
That is all you people
had to do. You just had to...

I made his bones.

559
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:16,271
I made his bones.

Excellent rule following.

570
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:12,443
I only have one
real area of interest.

571
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,178
The human heart. I love it.

572
00:34:14,202 --> 00:34:15,819

00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:20,841
I like its predictability.
It has rules.

575
00:34:20,943 --> 00:34:24,227
Every chamber has a function,
every function has a movement.

576
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:28,364
I like the color.
It's comforting.

577
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:33,303
Are you familiar with
Asperger's syndrome, Dr. Bailey?

578
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:39,442
Um... Of course. Significant
impairment during social situations...

579
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,098
I'm not good at cues like
sarcasm or condescension,

580
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,302
but I do know when I'm being
manipulated and made fun of.

581
00:34:49,404 --> 00:34:52,505
I don't think I like this
hospital very much.

582
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:59,378
I don't think I like
this hospital at all.

583
00:35:07,288 --> 00:35:10,106
Lexie Grey sure knows how
to wrap herself around a suture.

584
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,209
- Meredith had some concerns.
- That's not news.

585
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:16,980
About Lexie. Apparently
Lexie is fragile,

586
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:19,015
and getting involved
with a superior

587
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,450
might make her more fragile.

588
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:22,368
I was talking about her sutures.

589
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,287
Keep Little Sloan
out of Little Grey.

590
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:26,138
- What?
- Little Sloan

591
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:28,341
does not enter Little
Grey. Are we clear?

592
00:35:28,443 --> 00:35:30,020
- Did you just say...?
- Hmm-hmm.

593
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:33,613
OK, that's just
creepy... and inaccurate.

594
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:36,216
Big Sloan.

595
00:35:41,289 --> 00:35:43,540
You heading home?

596
00:35:50,364 --> 00:35:51,664
I love you.

597
00:35:53,468 --> 00:35:57,570
I will always love you.
You own a piece of me.

598
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:01,391
So even though you'll be gone...

599
00:36:02,544 --> 00:36:05,511
you will never be
forgotten. Not by me.

600
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:08,698
I'm sorry we never
got our chance.

601
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,568
I'm sorry we never
got to get married,

602
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,670
have children or
grow old together.

603
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:15,722
I wanted that so much.

604
00:36:16,825 --> 00:36:20,526
I wanted to be your
wife more than anything.

605
00:36:21,563 --> 00:36:23,825
Why are you telling me this?

606
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:26,316
I'm trying to let you go

607
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:29,502
so that your soul
could be at peace.

608
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:33,807
I have peace, Izzie.
I'm here for you.

609
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,062
Goodbye, Denny.

610
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:43,082
I love you, but goodbye.

611
00:36:57,983 --> 00:36:59,398
I can explain.

612
00:37:02,571 --> 00:37:04,798
I did not teach you
the parallel pulley stitch.

613
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:07,107
I can barely do it myself.

614
00:37:07,209 --> 00:37:09,676
Whatever you guys
are doing, shut it down.

615
00:37:09,778 --> 00:37:12,378
Do not practice on
yourself. That is insane.

616
00:37:12,948 --> 00:37:14,581

678
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:50,613
I burned the sweater.

679

680
00:40:53,568 --> 00:40:57,286

00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:23,963
Touch me.

687
00:41:43,117 --> 00:41:47,370
You see? I told you I was real.

688
