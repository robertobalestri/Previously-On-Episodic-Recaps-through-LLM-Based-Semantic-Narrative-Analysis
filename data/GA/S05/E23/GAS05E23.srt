1
00:00:01,902 --> 00:00:04,436
<i>When something begins,</i>

2
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:08,640
<i>you generally have no
idea how it's going to end.</i>

3
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:11,310
<i>The house you were going
to sell becomes your home.</i>

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,681
<i>The roommates you were forced
to take in become your family.</i>

5
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:19,802
<i>And the one-night stand
you were determined to forget</i>

6
00:00:19,904 --> 00:00:22,437
<i>becomes the love of your life.</i>

7
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:25,574
Hey. How long have you been up?

8
00:00:25,676 --> 00:00:27,393
All night. I was
trying to figure out

9
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:30,879
how to get the tumor
out of Izzie's brain.

10
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:32,430
Then why are you smiling?

11
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,099
'Cause I figured
out how to do it.

12
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,668
Once Izzie's in the clear,
we go to the Bahamas,

13
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:38,091
and have our
wedding on the beach.

14
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:39,587
The One & Only Beach Club.

15
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,924
You're gonna actually have
drinks during the ceremony.

16
00:00:42,026 --> 00:00:45,260
<i>♪ It just might
change your day ♪</i>

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,363
Sure you're OK to
be up and around?

18
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,566
Yes. I have good
days and bad days.

19
00:00:51,669 --> 00:00:55,336
I don't want to spend our entire
honeymoon in a hospital bed.

20
00:00:55,438 --> 00:00:58,907
- This is not our honeymoon.
- It totally is.

21
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:01,877
- I want you to meet my friends.
- I know all your friends.

22
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,444
You know all my doctor friends.

23
00:01:03,547 --> 00:01:06,347
I'm a patient now. You
gotta meet my patient friends.

24
00:01:06,449 --> 00:01:08,394
And they are gonna
love my new husband.

25
00:01:08,418 --> 00:01:11,119
- Don't make a big deal.
- I'm not gonna make a big deal.

26
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:14,656
I'm a bride!

27
00:01:14,758 --> 00:01:16,809
Iz, come on. I'm
getting her a real one.

28
00:01:16,894 --> 00:01:19,361
I love this one. That
makes it a real one.

29
00:01:19,463 --> 00:01:23,916
- Everybody, this is Alex. My husband.
- Hi.

30
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:28,637
Husband, this is Austin,
Star, Meg, Miguel and Alison.

31
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:31,406
Can you turn him around
so we can see the butt?

32
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:34,476
- Yes. Alex?
- What, are you kidding me?

33
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:39,314
Oh! A big trauma
just came in. That's...

34
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,877
- That's quality booty.
- Right?

35
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:44,252
- Congratulations, Izzie.
- Thank you.

36
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:52,344
So, uh, I had a good session
with my shrink this morning.

37
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,813
Did you talk to her
about your mom?

38
00:01:58,602 --> 00:02:00,135
Have you seen your mom yet?

39
00:02:00,237 --> 00:02:01,998
'Cause she lives
a few miles away,

40
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:03,300
and she thinks you're in Iraq.

41
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:07,459
- I am planning to see her.
- When?

42
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,617
Dr. Hunt? I'm not
on trauma today?

43
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,602
Follow me, O'Malley.

44
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,939
Lieutenant Lowell, I'm
Dr. Hunt, we spoke on the phone.

45
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,670
Major Hunt, it's good
to finally meet you.

46
00:02:23,694 --> 00:02:25,271
My CO's told me a lot about you.

47
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:27,845
You shouldn't believe
anything Steve Mason tells you.

48
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:30,115
This is Dr. O'Malley,
you've met Dr. Torres.

49
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:33,201
I'm looking at Charlie's
scans, but not finding anything

50
00:02:33,303 --> 00:02:34,614
functionally wrong with the leg.

51
00:02:34,638 --> 00:02:37,772
Except I can't walk
or run or move,

52
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:40,441
really, without serious
pain. I've tried everything.

53
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:42,978
Medications, physical
therapy, nothing works.

54
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,008
Which could indicate
nerve damage.

55
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,464
Or chronic pain syndrome.

56
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,785
And we can look into pain
management, but surgically,

57
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,154
I'm afraid there's
nothing I can do.

58
00:02:53,523 --> 00:02:55,240
Actually, there is.

59
00:02:56,693 --> 00:02:57,959
You could cut it off.

60
00:02:58,061 --> 00:03:01,062
You can cut it off, replace
it with a prosthetic leg

61
00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:03,632
so I can get back to
Iraq, where I'm needed.

62
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,064
- Did you know why he was here?
- No.

63
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,811
Is it such an
unreasonable request?

64
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:24,469
Unreasonable? Cutting off a
viable limb is dismemberment.

65
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,891
That kid made lieutenant at 19.

66
00:03:26,924 --> 00:03:29,290
He was planning on
spending his life in the military.

67
00:03:29,392 --> 00:03:31,009
They'll take him
back with one leg?

68
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:34,746
There have been amputees who've
returned to duty with prosthetics.

69
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,793
- Voluntary amputees?
- Maybe, I don't know.

70
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,377
I have to turn this kid away?

71
00:03:38,401 --> 00:03:41,420
His CO sent him here
because he trusts me.

72
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,105
We could get
another set of scans

73
00:03:43,207 --> 00:03:45,327
and then try an
epidural for the pain.

74
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:48,793
Dr. Torres?

75
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,780
Fine. Do an MRI and an epidural.
I'll take a look at the scans,

76
00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:54,549
but if the leg is healthy,
I'm not cutting it off.

77
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:02,290
- Dr. Bailey, you busy today?
- That depends.

78
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:04,809
You got any dying children
you want me to become

79
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,890
overly attached to
before they expire?

80
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,130
I have an eight-year-old
neuroblastoma patient

81
00:04:09,232 --> 00:04:11,316
and he's gonna live.
I feel it in my bones.

82
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,218
So scrub in with
me and see the joy.

83
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,888
Dr. Bailey, may I borrow you?

84
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:21,042
- Who is Santa Claus?
- An old, white man

85
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:22,622
who lives at the North Pole

86
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:24,779
and enters people's
homes inappropriately?

87
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:26,348
No.

88
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:30,017
I'm Santa Claus.

89
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,205
<i>All systems ready.</i>

90
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,358
Oh, no, you did not!

91
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:42,714
Oh, yes, I did. The Da
Vinci S-I HD Surgical System.

92
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:45,784
Tell me you didn't
wait until I'd all but left

93
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:48,753
the general surgery
program to buy the Da Vinci.

94
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,723
Care to take it out for a spin?

95
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:54,726
Santa!

96
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:57,707
Hey. I was thinking, you know,

97
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,499
with Derek and
Meredith getting married,

98
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,077
they probably don't
want us hanging out

99
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,501
in the attic much longer.

100
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:07,372
So I was thinking I'd
start looking for a condo.

101
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,024
Perfect. Then you'd finally
have a place of your own.

102
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:14,629
Actually, I was, you know,
thinking maybe you'd, uh...

103
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,476
- you'd come with me.
- Absolutely.

104
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,718
I'd love to see it. I
am so happy for you.

105
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:27,025
How much of that did you hear?

106
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,704
The part where you asked
her to move in with you

107
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,778
or where she shot you down?

108
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,681
I was here for both.
And, by the way,

109
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:36,484
it's just way too early for
you to be moving in with Lexie.

110
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,537
You don't have to
do everything I do.

111
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,921
This is not about you.

112
00:05:40,023 --> 00:05:42,657
I have my own future to
think about. Life is short.

113
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,826
Look at what's going
on with Stevens.

114
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,278
Don't worry about
Stevens. I got a plan.

115
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,392
You want to remove
her hippocampus?

116
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,599
One of them. It's a
common procedure.

117
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:53,585
Removing her hippocampus
could compromise

118
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:54,886
her memory, her speech.

119
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:57,350
She wouldn't be able
to practice medicine.

120
00:05:57,374 --> 00:05:59,969
- I've performed this
hundreds of times.
- On cancer patients?

121
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,893
- No, but it's...
- If you do it,

122
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,275
I could lose my memory?

123
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,432
It's unlikely,
but it's possible.

124
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,162
And if you don't
do the surgery...

125
00:06:09,186 --> 00:06:11,147
We could shrink
the tumor with IL2.

126
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,599
- If the tumor doesn't kill me first.
- - Why take the chance?

127
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,863
- Have you done a Wada test?
- - Putting her brain to sleep and asking her

128
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,511
to remember flash
cards is not an accurate...

129
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:22,280
But it would tell us whether
or not she could function after.

130
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,994
- As her physician...
- Fine, I'll do it. It's unnecessary.

131
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,563
The surgery is unnecessary.

132
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,319
She's having hallucinations.

133
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,069
Nice ring.

134
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,953
Alex outdid himself.

135
00:06:46,056 --> 00:06:49,707
We're gonna have beautiful
kids, don't you think?

136
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,828
- Is four too many?
- Four is perfect.

137
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,331
Ideally, it would be
two boys and two girls.

138
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:59,584
One of which will
definitely be a tomboy.

139
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,452
And I should have
them close together,

140
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,421
though that might be stupid.

141
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,024
- Why wait?
- Exactly.

142
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:09,961
That way, if I'm not able to
practice medicine anymore...

143
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:13,031
- You won't want to.
- You don't think?

144
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,767
- Do you?
- I'm asking you.

145
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:19,086
Why do you keep agreeing
with everything I say?

146
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:22,189
Because I am
you. I'm your tumor.

147
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:25,560
You're talking to yourself.

148
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:28,930
- Right.
- At least until
you have surgery.

149
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:34,252
If you have surgery. Are
you gonna have surgery?

150
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:54,773
If Derek cuts the tumor
out, I could lose my memory.

151
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:58,609
And if he doesn't, I could
die. I don't know what to do.

152
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:01,863
- Alex, tell me what to do.
- I can't tell you what to do.

153
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:03,893
Of course. You're my husband.

154
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,862
That's what husbands
do. They stomp around

155
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:08,553
telling their wives
what to do. It's your job.

156
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:12,507
- My job is to support you.
- I don't know
what I want to do.

157
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:14,342
That's why I'm asking you.

158
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,480
OK, I have an idea.
Let's put it to a vote.

159
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,250
- All in favor of the surgery.
- We're not voting.

160
00:08:22,352 --> 00:08:23,613
No one's voting.

161
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:27,505
- Opposed?
- I'm opposed.

162
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:31,626
- To voting.
- Just decide for me. Please?

163
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:34,829
You don't have to know
right now. Think about it.

164
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,148
I don't have time.

165
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,071
Captain Mason told
me you saved his life

166
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:45,439
four times in the field.

167
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,576
A couple in the canteen, but
don't tell Mace I told you that.

168
00:08:48,678 --> 00:08:51,228
So you think I'll
get to go back?

169
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:54,682
Are you sure you want to?

170
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,319
I mean, why do you
want to cut off your leg

171
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:02,056
just to go back to the
war? Don't you have family?

172
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:04,909
You know what it's like to
have family who don't know you,

173
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:08,663
don't get you, maybe
don't even like you?

174
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:11,465
Yeah, actually, I have brothers.

175
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:13,951
Me too.

176
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,573
So there's that family,
the guys I grew up with,

177
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:17,955
and we've got nothing in common.

178
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,825
And then there's
my guys in Iraq.

179
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:26,014
My real family.

180
00:09:26,116 --> 00:09:29,484
Whatever we got into,
we were in it together.

181
00:09:29,586 --> 00:09:32,670
But here, I'm alone. I'm nobody.

182
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:36,074
And I've tried. I've
tried fitting in here.

183
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,742
I've tried being
a regular person.

184
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:41,413
I've tried getting a job,
but there aren't any.

185
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,759
There are a lot of things
I wanted to be in my life,

186
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,650
things I wanted to do.

187
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:48,436
But none of 'em's here.

188
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,408
This is Alison Clark.

189
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,628
She was referred
to me two years ago.

190
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,808
Mets in her
brain, liver, kidney.

191
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:01,216
She ended up
having five surgeries

192
00:10:01,318 --> 00:10:03,551
and extensive
chemo, which worked.

193
00:10:03,653 --> 00:10:04,869
But then...

194
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:13,861
- The mets came back.
- That's when I started
her IL2 therapy.

195
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:17,932
And now, after three
treatments in as many months...

196
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:25,223
- The mets are gone?
- The mets are gone.

197
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:28,259
Dr. Stevens should be patient.

198
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:30,895
She should give her
therapies a chance.

199
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:36,534
As surgeons, we like to cut. But
sometimes there's a better way.

200
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,003
Let me retract that small bowel

201
00:10:44,027 --> 00:10:45,860
so you'll have
better visualization.

202
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:48,596
You know what,
chief? Thanks to Leo,

203
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:49,997
you don't have to.

204
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,335
- Leo?
- Leonardo. Da Vinci.

205
00:10:54,437 --> 00:10:57,538
Watch this. See?

206
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,775
Five hundred and forty
degrees of wristed movement.

207
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,013
Can't do that with
a laparoscope.

208
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:06,625
Or in open surgery.

209
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:08,766
Feels pretty good, doesn't it?

210
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,609
Dr. Bailey? Are you
making lightsaber noises?

211
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:21,979
Uh, not anymore, sir.

212
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,684
You know, Dr. Chalikonda
at Cleveland Clinic is doing

213
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,287
single-incision
gallbladder removal

214
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:32,724
through the belly button. We
can try that on the next one.

215
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,462
- If you're up to it.
- Don't tease me, sir.

216
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:42,750
I'm not. Why should
Dr. Chalikonda have all the fun?

217
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:55,429
It's impressive, but it took
two years to get these results.

218
00:11:55,532 --> 00:11:57,031
These were three months apart.

219
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,078
Izzie may not have three months.

220
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:02,854
That tumor could start bleeding
in three days. Or three seconds.

221
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:05,101
Since when are you
not about cutting?

222
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,908
It may not be in
the best interest.

223
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,844
Derek's not acting in
Izzie's best interests?

224
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,547
They're ready
for us in radiology.

225
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:33,768
OK, Iz, I'm going to show you...

226
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,620
a series of images you want me

227
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:37,989
to try to remember once
Derek puts the right side

228
00:12:38,074 --> 00:12:39,424
of my brain to sleep.

229
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:40,526
Mm-hm.

230
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:43,378
- Hit me. Show me what you got.
- OK.

231
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,563
Is that a schnauzer
or a Scottie?

232
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,226
How specific do I need to be?

233
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,716
Dog is fine.

234
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:54,172
- It's either a 727 or a 747.
- Plane.

235
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,559
Ooh. A two-story
Victorian mansion.

236
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:00,678
We would also
accept the word house.

237
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,798
Schnauzer, 747, mansion,
schnauzer, 747, mansion.

238
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,635
Or dog, plane, house.

239
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:10,705
I'm putting the right hemisphere
of your brain to sleep now, OK?

240
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:14,025
Dog, plane, house,
dog, plane, house...

241
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:18,630
Dog, plane, house,
dog, plane, house...

242
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:21,749
Dog, plane, house, dog, plane,
house, dog, plane, house...

243
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:25,920
OK. And now we wait for the
brain activity in that area to stop.

244
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:31,292
Dog, plane, house, dog, plane...

245
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,872
OK, Iz, are you gonna
tell me what you saw?

246
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:53,014
Show her the cards.

247
00:13:54,117 --> 00:13:55,332
What's this?

248
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:02,089
Dog. Can you say "dog"?

249
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:10,231
- What's my name?
- Just stick to the cards,
Meredith.

250
00:14:14,671 --> 00:14:16,437
Meredith.

251
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:18,956
You know my name.
You can say my name.

252
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:27,381
- This is what I was afraid of.
- OK. Who's Alex?

253
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,820
Iz, you don't have to speak.
Just nod your head for me

254
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:35,689
if you know who Alex Karev is.

255
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,917
The test impaired your
memory to such a degree

256
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:54,792
that I strongly recommend
you don't have the surgery.

257
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,006
Izzie, it was the
worst-case scenario.

258
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,898
- It has nothing to do with the surgery.
- - We don't know that.

259
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,077
I do know that not
operating is every bit as risky,

260
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:06,137
if not more so.
But it's up to you.

261
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:11,925
- What do you think?
- I think he's talking to you,
not me.

262
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:15,596
- I'll leave you two
alone to discuss.
- I'll come with you.

263
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:17,465
- I have a couple of questions.
- Alex.

264
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:20,051
Think about what you
want to do for a second, OK?

265
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,569
I'll be right back.

266
00:15:32,048 --> 00:15:34,932
You are not having the surgery.

267
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,219
I need you to not
talk medicine to me.

268
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:41,322
Talk to me like I'm your friend,

269
00:15:41,424 --> 00:15:43,591
like I'm the guy whose
cereal you eat in the morning,

270
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,392
and tell me what to do.

271
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:46,805
- Karev...
- Please.

272
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:48,507
Karev, I can't tell
you what to do.

273
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,165
What if it was Meredith?

274
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:54,068
What would you do
if you had to choose

275
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,370
between spending a few
more months with Meredith

276
00:15:56,472 --> 00:15:58,722
knowing she was gonna die,

277
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:01,192
watching her hurt,
watching her sick...

278
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:05,145
or spending the rest of
your life with someone

279
00:16:05,248 --> 00:16:08,199
who looked like Meredith,
but wasn't her anymore.

280
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,668
She's the one good thing
that ever happened to me.

281
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,070
The one good thing.

282
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:16,240
So I need to know what
to do. I need you to tell me,

283
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,275
what if it was Meredith?

284
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:23,664
I would ask her to
have the surgery.

285
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:29,803
You couldn't remember anything.

286
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,672
You didn't know my name.

287
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:35,359
You didn't know who Derek was,
you didn't know who Alex was.

288
00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:39,096
- You couldn't remember
how to speak.
- Why don't I remember this?

289
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,318
The tumor is sitting right
in the middle of everything

290
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,567
that makes you you.

291
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:48,256
I was standing there talking
to you exactly like I am now,

292
00:16:48,358 --> 00:16:52,809
only you weren't
there. You weren't you.

293
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,945
You were gone.

294
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:59,350
- So what do I do?
- Swender has a patient,

295
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:02,870
female, 22 years old,
metastatic melanoma.

296
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:05,823
- Alison Clark?
- After three months of IL2,

297
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,208
her mets were gone. All of them.

298
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,379
You're not having this surgery.

299
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:18,586
Don't do it. That's my vote.

300
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:21,088
Don't have the
surgery. I didn't.

301
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,274
I freakin' hate surgery.

302
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:28,229
I'm hallucinating, Alison.

303
00:17:28,331 --> 00:17:30,798
I have really long
conversations with dead people,

304
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,835
and I see things that aren't...

305
00:17:33,937 --> 00:17:37,638
Right now, I'm pretty certain

306
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,724
there aren't birds
flying over your head,

307
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,460
because this is a hospital
and that would be weird,

308
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:46,313
but that's what I'm seeing.
I have a brain tumor.

309
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:48,816
Am I really not gonna
let them cut it out?

310
00:17:48,918 --> 00:17:51,586
I didn't let them cut out mine.

311
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:56,090
It's like, OK, one minute
I'm this college kid,

312
00:17:56,192 --> 00:18:00,160
rowing crew and being an
idiot and forgetting my sunscreen

313
00:18:00,262 --> 00:18:03,247
and thinking it doesn't
matter because I'm me,

314
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:06,150
and life has worked
out pretty well for me.

315
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,852
And then, the next minute
they're cutting into my body

316
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:10,687
every other week.

317
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,158
I had 15 surgeries.

318
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:18,713
And then I said enough.

319
00:18:18,815 --> 00:18:23,417
Forget it. I'll row crew
in heaven, or whatever.

320
00:18:24,554 --> 00:18:29,323
And then the IL2
worked. It worked.

321
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:34,628
I come here every three
weeks, I get my medicine, and...

322
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,364
I don't have a brain
tumor anymore.

323
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:45,356
Charlie, if we admit you, if we
do what you're asking us to do,

324
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,659
the pain in your leg,
there's no way of knowing

325
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:49,989
if amputation will cure it.

326
00:18:50,013 --> 00:18:51,893
- But it might.
- Yes, it might.

327
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,464
And once I get the prosthetic...

328
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,877
It will be months
before I can even begin

329
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,301
fitting you with a prosthetic.

330
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:59,883
Which won't feel anything
like a new leg, by the way.

331
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:02,873
It'll feel like five pounds of
metal that hurts and pinches.

332
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,425
And what if the Army says no,

333
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:06,154
what if they don't
take you back?

334
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:09,147
- They will. Chances are...
- You want to take that chance?

335
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:12,233
You're asking me to
remove one of your limbs.

336
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:14,563
You think I don't know that,
you think I want to cut my leg off?

337
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:17,521
Of course not. Am I
sure about this? No.

338
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:20,107
The only thing I'm sure
about is I'm in hell right now.

339
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:23,027
That I'm sure of.

340
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:24,428
I've lost everything.

341
00:19:24,513 --> 00:19:26,897
Everything I've worked
for, everything I care about,

342
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,466
and I traded it in for a
six-times-a-day pain pill habit

343
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:32,570
that doesn't work. So don't waste
both our time trying to scare me,

344
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:36,006
because you don't scare me.

345
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:39,509
After everything I've been
through, nothing scares me.

346
00:19:43,232 --> 00:19:45,349
So are we gonna do this or not?

347
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:54,291
Dr. Robbins, Dr. Bailey just
performed Seattle Grace's

348
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,760
first single-incision
gallbladder removal.

349
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,930
- Oh, wow! Cool!
- Through the patient's
belly button.

350
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,300
- And now it's kind of creepy.
- No, you should've seen it.

351
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,730
No scars, no bleeding,
and about half the time

352
00:20:05,754 --> 00:20:07,866
it would've taken
laparascopically.

353
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,139
You want to do one after lunch?

354
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,209
- I've got another colon.
- You don't mind?

355
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:15,512
Oh... So I guess I'm on
my own for this afternoon?

356
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:19,000
My neuroblastoma? No,
don't worry. You don't have to.

357
00:20:19,102 --> 00:20:22,253
You'll have the rest of your
life to do neuroblastomas.

358
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:25,339
- Then I'll see you after lunch.
- OK.

359
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:30,461
- Chief?
- Yes, Dr. Robbins?

360
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:37,017
- Chief...
- Did you want
to tell me something?

361
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:39,119
I am going to cry.

362
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:42,406
I just want you to know that
I know it's going to happen,

363
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:45,109
and I just want
you to ignore it.

364
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:46,955
And I'm not crying
because I'm upset.

365
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,991
It's just what happens
when I get mad

366
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:52,599
- at people of authority.
- You're mad at me?

367
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:53,982
I am mad at you.

368
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,687
And I'm crying because
you're the boss, my boss,

369
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,683
which brings up issues
with authority and my dad,

370
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:00,241
who you remind me of.

371
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,604
Not that you're old. But
you command respect.

372
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,206
People respect you.
I mean, I know I do.

373
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,830
I know Bailey does.
Which is why I am mad.

374
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,534
Because it's wrong,
sir, it's wrong and mean

375
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,917
to use a robot to lure Bailey
back to general surgery.

376
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,438
I don't have a robot.

377
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,241
All I have are little kids.
They're not as fun as a robot.

378
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:21,712
And they're not shiny
and new and silver,

379
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:25,248
and they don't have things coming
out of their belly buttons but...

380
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:28,469
I will fight you.
And I will win.

381
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:31,488
- Sir.
- You think you can fight me

382
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,140
and win?

383
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:39,730
- Yes.
- Good luck.

384
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:44,952
Because I have something
you don't have. I have joy! Sir.

385
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,994
<i>Dr. Toretto, pathology.</i>

386
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:54,712
<i>Dr. Toretto, pathology.</i>

387
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:58,682
- What's going on?
- We're going over Izzie's
IL2 schedule.

388
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,150
Oh, for after the surgery?

389
00:22:06,308 --> 00:22:09,326
I decided not to
have the surgery.

390
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:13,013
- What?
- Maybe we should come back.

391
00:22:13,115 --> 00:22:14,514
Dr. Yang.

392
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,904
- You're having the surgery.
- What?

393
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,435
- Shepherd said this is
your last shot.
- But I just...

394
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:26,259
I am your husband, I say
that you are having the surgery!

395
00:22:26,361 --> 00:22:29,279
What happened to,
"This is your decision..."

396
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:32,032
That was when I thought you
were gonna make the right one!

397
00:22:32,135 --> 00:22:34,801
You chose wrong, so you don't
make this decision on your own,

398
00:22:34,903 --> 00:22:36,186
you married me!

399
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,623
It's not just your life at stake
anymore! It's my life, too!

400
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:42,493
My life with you!

401
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:44,578
You can tell Swender
whatever you want,

402
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,916
but I'm telling Shepherd, and
you, you are having the surgery!

403
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:07,695
She's your friend, but
that doesn't give the right

404
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,597
to talk her out of a surgery
you know nothing about.

405
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,956
You're Swender's resident.

406
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,135
What you did was
inappropriate, it is unprofessional.

407
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,060
- You crossed a line!
- No, she didn't. I did.

408
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,430
I'm the one who convinced
Izzie not to have surgery.

409
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:21,915
I'm the one you should
be yelling at right now.

410
00:23:26,288 --> 00:23:28,806
Well, I'm gonna go now.

411
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:33,594
Unless you wanna
apologize... OK.

412
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,852
My mother disappeared
right in front of me.

413
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:43,920
Everything she had,
everything she was,

414
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:45,356
her dignity, her memory.

415
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,625
In the end, she
wasn't even my mother.

416
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,209
Izzie is not your mother.

417
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:51,679
She doesn't have an
untreatable brain condition.

418
00:23:51,781 --> 00:23:54,147
She has a tumor.
And it can be treated.

419
00:23:54,249 --> 00:23:55,782
Don't make this personal.

420
00:23:55,885 --> 00:23:58,535
- I wasn't.
- You went to Izzie,
as her friend,

421
00:23:58,637 --> 00:23:59,881
and you made up
her mind for her.

422
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,590
As my resident, go
back there and change it.

423
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:05,809
Because this
tumor will kill her.

424
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:12,599
Quick consult, Dr. Yang?

425
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,737
What are you doing?

426
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:23,276
The reason I haven't told my mother
I'm back is part of me is still there.

427
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,880
I made a commitment to
the Army I wasn't able to fulfill.

428
00:24:25,982 --> 00:24:28,265
If my unit hadn't been
destroyed, I'd be there.

429
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:31,551
No wonder I can't
sleep at night,

430
00:24:31,653 --> 00:24:34,638
or look my mother in the eye.
You and I can't move forward.

431
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,973
My work there isn't done.

432
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:39,826
And until it is, I have
no business being here.

433
00:24:42,431 --> 00:24:45,766
So... I've decided to go back.

434
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,636
I have to go.

435
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:53,624
- Cristina, come on.
- What am I supposed to say?

436
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:58,746
- I could use your support.
- You don't have it.

437
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:10,173
Dr. Torres? Dr. O'Malley?

438
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:13,027
I just wanted to apologize.

439
00:25:13,129 --> 00:25:14,894
- It's OK.
- You don't have to.

440
00:25:14,997 --> 00:25:19,550
I do. 'Cause you were
trying to do your job in there,

441
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:22,218
your job is to put people back
together, not take 'em apart.

442
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,687
I get that.

443
00:25:25,207 --> 00:25:27,674
I know it doesn't make sense
to you that I want to go back

444
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,344
to a place where
people get hurt and die,

445
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:34,281
but we're there because
we're trying to help people.

446
00:25:34,383 --> 00:25:36,383
Save people. The
same as you. It's my job.

447
00:25:36,485 --> 00:25:39,987
It's who I am. It's...

448
00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:44,191
If something happened and suddenly
you couldn't be a doctor anymore,

449
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:47,127
if someone told you you
couldn't do it anymore,

450
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:49,091
wouldn't you wanna do
everything you could possibly do

451
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:51,215
to be a doctor again?

452
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,571
We haven't been
married 24 hours,

453
00:25:58,673 --> 00:26:00,874
and we've had our first fight.

454
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:05,262
That's a good sign. Fighting
leads to good make-up sex.

455
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:10,617
Are you watching birds
fly around my head again?

456
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:13,503
Am I, like, totally
Snow White right now?

457
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,009
- I just don't want to hurt him.
- He'll come around.

458
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:22,679
It might take a while, but
once that tumor disappears,

459
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:25,149
once you're back at work
cutting open other people,

460
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,234
he'll come around.

461
00:26:30,806 --> 00:26:33,223
Is it hummingbirds at least?

462
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,360
I really like hummingbirds.

463
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,336
- We need to talk to Izzie.
- We are not talking Izzie

464
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:48,472
into having surgery because
your future husband is mad at you.

465
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:49,806
He has a right to be mad.

466
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,753
We didn't talk Izzie out
of the surgery as doctors,

467
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:56,430
- we did it as her friends.
- Our job as doctors
is to present the options,

468
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:59,333
answer questions and let the
patient decide the course of treatment.

469
00:26:59,434 --> 00:27:03,103
- That's what we did.
- Right. Except I may have

470
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,804
presented her options as,

471
00:27:04,907 --> 00:27:07,824
"You're having this
surgery over my dead body."

472
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:13,997
He has a right to be mad.

473
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,866
- Crap.
- Who is it?

474
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,117
Come on.

475
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,649
- Izzie, what...?
- What happened?

476
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:23,240
- I don't know. Where's Swender!
- Izzie, let me take over.

477
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:25,442
Yeah, Izzie, come sit down.

478
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:39,089
The vessels and
nerves are separated.

479
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:40,691
Skin flap is done.

480
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:45,529
Remind me again why I'm doing
this. Someone remind me again.

481
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:51,468
You don't know what's
gonna happen to this kid,

482
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:56,707
how many fights he could win,
how many lives he could save.

483
00:27:58,193 --> 00:28:02,629
If you don't do this, he's
never gonna get the chance.

484
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:06,766
We're not doing harm. We're
not hurting him. We're saving him.

485
00:28:06,868 --> 00:28:08,701
We're doing what he wants.

486
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,572
It's what he wants.

487
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,844
- BP's still dropping.
- We need more blood.

488
00:28:39,868 --> 00:28:42,588
- We need to move faster.
- I'm done. I'm at the end.

489
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,416
I didn't see any
bowel perforation.

490
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,139
It's there somewhere.
Run it again.

491
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:48,458
- Dr...
- Run it again.

492
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:52,212
Yes, ma'am.

493
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,281
So much for IL2.

494
00:28:57,018 --> 00:28:59,536
You think this is my fault?

495
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:03,189
- You think I did this to her?
- No, ma'am.

496
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:06,326
There is no cure
for cancer, Dr. Yang.

497
00:29:06,428 --> 00:29:08,345
There's only us, the two of us,

498
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:12,282
right here, fighting this thing as
aggressively as we know how.

499
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:16,102
And sometimes that means pumping
toxins into the patient to kill the cancer.

500
00:29:16,204 --> 00:29:21,641
And, yes, sometimes, not very often,
those toxins kill the patient as well.

501
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:26,230
Alison had three months to live
when she first came to see me,

502
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,700
and I have managed to
keep her alive for two years.

503
00:29:29,802 --> 00:29:34,805
So I am not about to give up
on her, or the IL2, anytime soon,

504
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:36,673
and neither are you.

505
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,145
I wasn't asking you
to see the condo.

506
00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:50,253
I was asking you
to move in with me.

507
00:29:51,974 --> 00:29:54,724
If that's what you want.

508
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:58,145
- I do.
- You do?

509
00:29:58,247 --> 00:30:02,315
- Yeah. Not right away.
- No, of course not. In like...

510
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:05,001
- a year. I'm sorry, what, now?
- Ten years. Oh.

511
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:09,422
Well, because I'll still be a
resident for six more years,

512
00:30:09,524 --> 00:30:13,327
and then I'd want to get my
practice up and running, so...

513
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:15,395
- How about seven?
- How about five years?

514
00:30:15,497 --> 00:30:19,082
- I'll still be a resident.
- So? Stevens and Karev
are residents.

515
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:20,394
Meredith's a resident.
Bailey's a resident.

516
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:23,237
All married, or soon to be.

517
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:25,872
And happily. Or whatever.

518
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:31,795
I'm sorry, are you
asking me to marry you?

519
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:34,847
No!

520
00:30:34,949 --> 00:30:36,650
- Why? Would you?
- Um...

521
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,095
Should we be having
this conversation?

522
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:39,836
No, probably not.

523
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,454
OK...

524
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:43,613
Impressive work
today, Dr. Bailey.

525
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,608
Thank you, sir. It was fun.

526
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,561
Yeah, it was, wasn't it?

527
00:30:56,171 --> 00:30:57,955
Sounds like you
guys had a good day.

528
00:30:58,057 --> 00:31:01,241
How'd the neuroblastoma kid do?

529
00:31:01,343 --> 00:31:03,393
Oh. He was awesome.
The surgery was easy,

530
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:04,794
he gonna make a full recovery.

531
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:06,696
That's kinda why I
wanted you there.

532
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,264
Because the kids you can save

533
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,516
almost make up for
the ones you can't.

534
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,153
Anyways, I'm gonna go
monitor him at post-op,

535
00:31:13,255 --> 00:31:14,975
and then I'll tell his
family the good news.

536
00:31:15,056 --> 00:31:17,607
Stop by, come see the joy.

537
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,110

Unfortunately, we weren't
able to finish the surgery

543
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,728
because she was too unstable.

544
00:31:55,964 --> 00:31:58,004
Right now, she's on a ventilator

545
00:31:58,033 --> 00:32:00,567
because she can't
breathe on her own.

546
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:05,455
But you'll be able to
finish the surgery, right?

547
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:10,076
Yes, if she stabilizes.

548
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,562

00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:21,344

alive. It's not what I want.

613
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:26,516

619
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,466
I just want to go

620
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:46,469
I don't know what's there,
but it's gotta be better

621
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:50,106

622
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,810
Please don't cut LVADs.

623
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:55,912

628
