1
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:06,872
<i>My mother used to
say this about residency:</i>

2
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:10,742
<i>It takes a year to
learn how to cut.</i>

3
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:14,162
<i>It takes a lifetime
to learn not to.</i>

4
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:17,115
I'm up. I'm here.
What's going on?

5
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:21,119
Jackson's BP, it's a little down
from yesterday. No big deal.

6
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,538
But if we make a
few calls, get pushy,

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,992
we could get him bumped a
few spots up on the transplant list.

8
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:31,930
Dr. Bailey, you paged me 911.
At 2:30 in the morning. To chat?

9
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:37,669
- You like to chat. You're chatty.
- Not at 2:30 in the morning!

10
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,939
Look, he's young, he's
near the top of the list.

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,409
UNOS will find him organs when
they find him organs, and God knows,

12
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:47,563
staying up all night chatting
about it is not gonna help.

13
00:00:47,665 --> 00:00:51,666
Now, I'm going to get some
sleep. I suggest you do the same.

14
00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:53,434
He's running out of time.

15
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:58,256
They always are.
Welcome to Peds.

16
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:02,094
<i>Of all of the tools
on a surgical tray,</i>

17
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:06,265
<i>sound judgment is the
trickiest one to master.</i>

18
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:07,749
<i>And without it,</i>

19
00:01:07,852 --> 00:01:11,220
<i>we're all just toddlers
running around with ten blades.</i>

20
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:19,311
Ohhh. I asked them not to wake you.
"Whatever it is can wait till morning.

21
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:23,681
- Dr. Shepherd needs his sleep."
- Your latest head CT shows

22
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:29,454
the brain contusions expanding.
We need to get you into OR right away.

23
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:33,241
This... this brain
thing, it could kill me?

24
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,444
If we don't treat it, yes.

25
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:40,081
- You find that funny.
- I'm sorry, it's just
they're gonna

26
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:42,951
execute me in five days.

27
00:01:43,053 --> 00:01:45,220
Five days.

28
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:48,690
Might as well take my chances
with this brain thing, right?

29
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:50,792
- Mr. Dunn...
- You've got to admit,

30
00:01:50,894 --> 00:01:52,044
it's a nice way to go,

31
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:56,715
plenty of attractive females.

32
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:59,984
All the Jell-o I could want.
Have you tried the strawberry?

33
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:04,172
- It'll change your life.
- You're refusing surgery?

34
00:02:04,274 --> 00:02:08,543
Either way, I'm going
to die, Dr. Shepherd.

35
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:10,996
Might as well do
it on your watch.

36
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:20,956
Why do you have to
live in Meredith's attic?

37
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:24,309
How am I supposed to sneak
out with that frat party going?

38
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:27,662
- Don't you kids ever sleep?
- They're cleaning the house

39
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:29,598
for Dr. Shepherd's mother.

40
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,770
Mrs. Shepherd's coming?

41
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,223
- To Seattle?
- So?

42
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,627
That woman practically raised
me, taught me right from wrong.

43
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:44,178
If she found out that I was...

44
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:46,214
with you, that we were...

45
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:49,284
You're Meredith Grey's
little sister, forbidden fruit.

46
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:53,021
You are 25. You're a fetus.

47
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:55,874
Twenty-four. I
skipped third grade.

48
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,377
I feel dirty.

49
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,279
Ten bucks says she tanks
in the first five minutes.

50
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,598
I have faith in Death.

51
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,702
She's holding that bottle
of tequila like it's a life vest.

52
00:03:06,804 --> 00:03:11,506
- Don't listen to them. She'll love you.
- No. Mothers don't love me.

53
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,609
Mothers like bright and
bubbly and happy and...

54
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:18,113
- Izzie. Mothers love Izzie.
- They do.

55
00:03:18,215 --> 00:03:21,016
- Mothers do love Izzie.
- My mother would've loved you.

56
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,603
Uh, I stashed all the tequila, took
the condoms out of the cookie jar.

57
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:29,691
I replaced all your trashy magazines
with issues of<i> Annals of Surgery.</i>

58
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,121
- OK?
- OK.

59
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:34,079
Does it smell musty in here?

60
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:37,148
My mom's house smells
like peppermint. It's homey.

61
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,170
- My house isn't homey?
- I feel at home.

62
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:42,020
- This place is a palace.
- Why isn't my house homey?

63
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:45,290
- It's just a feeling!
- Izzie can't fix a feeling!

64
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,909
She's freaking out. Tell
her something I can fix.

65
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:50,795
Rebecca peed on
that couch cushion.

66
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,831
I've been sleeping
there for weeks.

67
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,050
Thanks, Alex.
You're a good friend.

68
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,785
You're welcome. Keep drinking.

69
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,246
- Mark?
- Hey, there you are.

70
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:08,892
- Wanna drink?
- It's 4:00 am.

71
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,215
You're right. I
should've called first.

72
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:15,003
Hey, I hear your mom's
coming into town. Good times.

73
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:18,023
You'll be fine.

74
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,809
Just keep the talking to a
minimum. Short nuggets of Meredith.

75
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:25,313
That's all anyone really needs.
If you get stuck, just smile.

76
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:27,982
You have a really great smile.

77
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:31,870
That's just scary.

78
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:35,424
Mer? Are you sure you want
to wear your hair like that?

79
00:04:54,244 --> 00:04:56,511
You're wearing an
alarmingly high ponytail.

80
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:58,897
Your mother is coming.

81
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:06,121
Mr. Dunn, the swelling in
your brain is increasing rapidly.

82
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:09,774
- The longer we wait,
the worse it gets.
- Excellent.

83
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,828
- Go, team.
- I suggest
you reconsider surgery.

84
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,747
Have you seen the inside of
a maximum-security prison?

85
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:20,985
Believe me, if you have to
die, this is the place to do it.

86
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,588
In good company.

87
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,924
You two vigilantly monitor
Mr. Dunn's elevating ICP's,

88
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:31,012
you will do hourly exams. When
he goes unconscious, which he will,

89
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:35,484
- we'll rush him to surgery.
- You can't do that. Can he do that?

90
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:38,837
When you're unconscious and
can no longer make decisions,

91
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,589
a two-doctor consent
is needed to treat you.

92
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:44,625
I'm gonna be dead as a
doornail in five days! Dr. Grey...

93
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:47,395
- We're done.
- Would you fix
a broken television

94
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:50,014
- before you throw it out?
- He's got a point.

95
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,251
Trying to cheat the system.
We're not gonna let him do it.

96
00:05:55,472 --> 00:05:57,772
- What's the problem?
- I have an infection

97
00:05:57,874 --> 00:06:00,642
- from a little
surgery I had done.
- In Hong Kong.

98
00:06:00,744 --> 00:06:06,231
My crazy-ass brother got crazy-ass
elective surgery in Hong Kong.

99
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,716
- Who does that?
- Short people.

100
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:10,752
Desperate short people!

101
00:06:10,854 --> 00:06:14,856
I had my legs lengthened. I couldn't
find a surgeon who would do it here.

102
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,577
Look, it's barbaric.
They broke his legs,

103
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:21,613
and they hooked him up to
some medieval torture device.

104
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:25,533
Yeah, that's to pull the bones
apart. That's the lengthening process.

105
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,486
It's controversial. I
don't perform it myself.

106
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:30,639
Can I take a look?

107
00:06:37,547 --> 00:06:39,998
They said it'd give
me two whole inches.

108
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,752
- Any word from UNOS?
- Not yet.

109
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:47,088
Dr. Karev is in constant
contact with them.

110
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:52,010
How much longer will we wait?
Are livers and intestines hard to find?

111
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:55,947
Jackson's blood is O positive,
shouldn't be difficult to match.

112
00:06:57,234 --> 00:07:00,385
He's had blood transfusions,
which means there could be

113
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:05,423
extra antibodies that are hard to
match, so we need patience, Melinda.

114
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:11,329
In the meantime, I need to run some
tests on Jackson to check electrolytes.

115
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,882
We're gonna do everything we
can to help your son, Mrs. Prescott.

116
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:16,635
All of us.

117
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:21,906
- You. You're squirrelly.
- I'm sorry?

118
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,842
I don't trust you. I don't
trust you in this hospital,

119
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,779
and I don't trust you with
my patient of three years

120
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,447
who is extremely important.

121
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,600
- I...
- If you want to stay
on this case,

122
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,821
you will stay out of my way,
you will do what I tell you,

123
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:39,007
and if you have something
to say to or about my patient,

124
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:42,861
you will raise your hand
and wait to be called on.

125
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,113
You've got to be kidding me.

126
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,740
- Yes?
- This is a joke, right?

127
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,743
Do I look like I'm laughing?

128
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,517
- You're upset.
- I don't get upset
with patients.

129
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:10,405
You're mad at me for killing
those women. I get that.

130
00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:14,909
Would you feel differently if
you knew I was beaten as a child?

131
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:18,313
Every day. It's how
I learned to read.

132
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,665
I used to hide under the sink

133
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:24,419
and sound out the letters
on the detergent box.

134
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:32,127
- Is that true?
- Did it make you feel better?

135
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,631
Whatever helps you
sleep at night, Dr. Grey.

136
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:39,700
Cool.

137
00:08:39,802 --> 00:08:42,120
Did you do something bad?

138
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:47,808
Traffic violation.

139
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:56,017
What's wrong with you, kid?

140
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,519
I need a new liver
and a new intestine.

141
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,974
Yeah? You want mine?

142
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:15,420
Are you in the north terminal?
That's where she's supposed to be.

143
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:19,157
No. Don't go
anywhere, just wait.

144
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:22,444
I found her. There's a town
car waiting at the airport.

145
00:09:22,546 --> 00:09:25,779
I don't need a fancy car, I hopped
on the bus. Saved you money.

146
00:09:25,882 --> 00:09:29,217
So this cruise... you happened
to have a layover in Seattle?

147
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,919
I've always wanted to
check out the Space Needle.

148
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:34,689
I understand you can see
Mt. Rainier from the top.

149
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,192
- Anything else?
- Are you gonna take me or not?

150
00:09:37,294 --> 00:09:40,178
I got back-to-back surgeries.
Got to give me notice.

151
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,748
Yeah, I gave birth to five
doctors. I know the drill.

152
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:48,870
I can wait, maybe meet your
colleagues. Is that Mark Sloan?

153
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:52,006
- Mark Sloan!
- Mrs. Shepherd. You look great.

154
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:55,342
Oh, damn. We'll catch up later?

155
00:09:55,444 --> 00:09:57,762
Perfect timing.

156
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:01,366
- Mom, this is Meredith.
- Meredith! Finally.

157
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,369
- Hi.
- My son's been acting
like a dog

158
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:09,123
with his favorite bone, hiding
you. I hope you're free for lunch.

159
00:10:09,226 --> 00:10:12,827
I can't wait to dive right in
and find out all about you.

160
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:15,313
Mer looks weird. Does
she look weird to you?

161
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:19,567
- Like she's gonna
pee her pants.
- Crap. I made her hydrate.

162
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:22,937
Meeting the family always
blows. I'd never make you do that.

163
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,357
Me, either. One of the many
perks of dating a dead guy.

164
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:34,031
- Who's that lady
touching Meredith?
- Derek's mom.

165
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:38,503
- Huh. That's why
she looks so weird.
- She does not look weird.

166
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:42,240
I've got it under control.
Mer is doing... great.

167
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,593
Looks like she's gonna pee.

168
00:10:45,695 --> 00:10:48,947
Dr. Yang, you mind checking
in on some of my post-ops?

169
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:52,934
ER's swamped with traumas.
Also, would you like to go on a date?

170
00:10:53,036 --> 00:10:56,904
- I'm sorry?
- A date.

171
00:10:57,006 --> 00:11:00,591
You said not to play hot
and cold with you, so...

172
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,994
I'll pick you up around eight.

173
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,931
And make sure Mr. Kenner
in room 2212 gets that enema.

174
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:10,100
He's been holding
on to it for days.

175
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:12,853
OK.

176
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:15,256
'Cause that wasn't weird.

177
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:23,248
Another perk to dating a
dead guy: no awkward dates.

178
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,883
Two to one. But who's counting.

179
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:31,488
Why can't I have that nice
man's organs? He offered.

180
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:35,059
You know how in school there
are rules you have to follow?

181
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:38,563
Same goes for here. We
have to follow the rules,

182
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:41,032
or else we get in big trouble.

183
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:45,202
And what that man offered
you is definitely against the rules.

184
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,190
She's fighting with the
insurance people again.

185
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,026
You're not supposed to
worry about stuff like that.

186
00:11:53,396 --> 00:11:55,830
Tell her something good today.

187
00:11:55,932 --> 00:12:01,035
Even if nothing good
happens. She needs good news.

188
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:07,374
I've got a body full of
high-quality parts here.

189
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,260
Three-day liquidation sale.

190
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,729
Everything must go.

191
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,565
Even if we could do it, you
have to be a match for him.

192
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,535
Which means we have to
cross match your blood with his.

193
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:20,054
Good thing we're
both in a hospital then.

194
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:26,944
Let... let me save
a life before I go.

195
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:31,115
It's the least I can do.

196
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:37,372
So you really expect me to
believe you want to do this for a kid?

197
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,378
Whatever helps you
sleep at night, Dr. Grey.

198
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:49,133
The infection's made its
way deep into the bone.

199
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,868
We're gonna take the rods out.

200
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,171
Clean out the
infected skin and bone.

201
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,207
I won't get my two inches?
All that pain, for nothing?

202
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:59,710
Mr. Ruben, at this point, you're
lucky to keep your legs at all.

203
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:03,397
That's easy for you to say.
What are you, 5'10, 5'11?

204
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:06,034
- Leave the doctors alone.
- Shut up, Gary.

205
00:13:06,136 --> 00:13:09,020
You are over six feet tall!

206
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:12,056
Do you have any
idea what it's like

207
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,409
to have everybody you know
literally look down on you?

208
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:19,063
Or how humiliating it is to have
to ask for help from a teenager

209
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:22,300
at the grocery store because
you can't reach the top shelf?

210
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:25,219
I've gone on two dates
in the last six months

211
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:28,923
with women I met over the Internet.
No one wants to see me again.

212
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:32,259
- No one wants
to date the short guy.
- Chuck...

213
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:37,198
I wanted those two inches,
Gary. I wanted them so bad.

214
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:42,020
It's two inches. What's the
difference between 5'3 " and 5'5"?

215
00:13:45,474 --> 00:13:47,725
5'5" you can say out loud.

216
00:13:53,215 --> 00:13:57,769
OK. I made a list of the best
pediatric GI's in the country.

217
00:13:57,871 --> 00:14:01,805
We can get one of these guys to
come do a TIPS procedure on him.

218
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,624
On a kid who needs a new liver?

219
00:14:03,726 --> 00:14:05,793
Like putting a Band-Aid
on a bullet wound.

220
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:08,779
- You have a better idea?
- I do.

221
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:12,083
Wait for UNOS. Trusting the
process. Why can't you do that?

222
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,069
Because I'm tired of waiting
while this kid gets worse.

223
00:14:15,171 --> 00:14:18,572
Jackson's tired, his mother is.
The only one who's happy to sit

224
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:20,770
and twiddle her thumbs is you!

225
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:23,044
I've been patient with
you, I've been nice,

226
00:14:23,146 --> 00:14:26,648
but I am really over you constantly
telling me how to do my job.

227
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,684
- Somebody's got to...
- I have 20 other kids...

228
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:32,019
Shut up!

229
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,340
Respectfully.
Respectfully, shut up.

230
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,208
Because we got organs.

231
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:47,601
I wish you could get organs delivered
instead of having to go pick them up.

232
00:14:47,704 --> 00:14:51,856
I hate flying. I always feel much closer
to death on a plane than in the OR.

233
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,459
- Don't you?
- I do now.

234
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,596
I met Izzie the other day.

235
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,714
She's very pretty.

236
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,083
So do you think she's the one?

237
00:15:03,185 --> 00:15:04,601
I... I don't know.

238
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,154
Well, we're at that age, right?

239
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:09,857
Marriage, babies.

240
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:12,060
- That the plan?
- I don't know!

241
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,913
I'm sorry, I don't
make plans, OK?

242
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:20,118
If there's a future, great. If not,
I'll get over it. I always do. OK?

243
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,873
OK.

244
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:29,127
I think it's nice. Your date.

245
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:31,695
You and the pig murderer
make a good couple.

246
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,614
- OK.
- What are you gonna do?

247
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:36,033
- What are you gonna talk about?
- You care?

248
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,853
Yeah, why do you care?

249
00:15:38,955 --> 00:15:42,823
You only get to do a first
date once. It should be fun

250
00:15:42,926 --> 00:15:45,192
and sexy and...

251
00:15:45,294 --> 00:15:46,860
Ask really good questions.

252
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:49,497
Ask him why he first decided
he wanted to save lives.

253
00:15:49,598 --> 00:15:52,583
- Ask him what
his best surgery was.
- I know how to go on a date.

254
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:56,236
Why is Meredith
eating pot roast?

255
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:58,538
It's a show lunch for the mommy.

256
00:15:58,575 --> 00:16:01,926
She's freaking out. That
ponytail is gonna blow.

257
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,547
Derek tells me you
grew up here in Seattle.

258
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:09,584
- Are your parents...?
- Dead.

259
00:16:09,686 --> 00:16:12,169
Meredith's mother
died last year.

260
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,671
Oh.

261
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:17,241
I'm so sorry. And your father?

262
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,560
Oh. You know,

263
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:21,995
I should go check
on the patient.

264
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:24,748
Who's the serial killer...

265
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,166
who's here.

266
00:16:26,268 --> 00:16:28,353
Not killing people.

267
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:29,920
So that's good.

268
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,473
- I should go.
- Yeah.

269
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:33,907
OK.

270
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,347
Family isn't her
favorite topic, OK?

271
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,284
- She's had a rough time of it.
- I didn't say a word.

272
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,920
I know what you're thinking.

273
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:52,543
I was thinking... it
must be awful for you.

274
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:54,878
Treating a murderer.

275
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:01,869
Dad died a long
time ago. I'm fine.

276
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:08,342
- What are you doing?
- Sleep with me,
you lunch with me.

277
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,295
- New rule.
- You let interns sit with you?

278
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:15,333
- That's so cool.
- Wanna go halfsies
on that cookie?

279
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,668
What are you
gonna trade me for it?

280
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,370
You guys, they have Tater Tots!

281
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:24,108
I have to go.

282
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,030
- Mark?
- Mrs. Shepherd.

283
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,199
- You've been avoiding me.
- What? No.

284
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,919
You have the same look on your
face as you did when you were ten

285
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:38,856
and put Derek's favorite
frog in the microwave.

286
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:43,443
- I never pressed start.
- What's going on?

287
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:47,715
I'm sleeping with her.

288
00:17:49,185 --> 00:17:53,421
- Oh, Mark, not again! How could you?
- No... No.

289
00:17:53,523 --> 00:17:55,623
Not Meredith. God, no.

290
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,360
Meredith's little sister.

291
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:02,363
Which one is she?

292
00:18:02,465 --> 00:18:05,149
The... one with the juice box.

293
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:12,756
- Are my new organs here yet?
- Not yet.

294
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,293
But we're gonna get
you all prepped now

295
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,795
so we can put them in
as soon as they get here.

296
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:21,465
When you wake up, you'll be a
brand-new boy with brand-new parts.

297
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,745
I can't believe this is it.

298
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:28,038
The thought of us getting to live
our lives outside this hospital...

299
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,907
Don't get me wrong,
I love our chats.

300
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,442
But it'll be nice
not to see my face.

301
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,528
So freaking nice!

302
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:50,311
- It's just a kid.
- Yep. Let's go get his organs.

303
00:18:55,818 --> 00:19:00,237
Am I hallucinating or is
that a really high ponytail?

304
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,940
You're not hallucinating.

305
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:06,744
But once your brain starts to
herniate, I can't promise anything.

306
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:10,447
So I'm really circling
the drain here?

307
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,751
You should just take my organs
right now. Help that poor kid.

308
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:16,904
They found him organs.
They're flying them over right now.

309
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:18,739
He's going to be fine.

310
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:31,134
Did you know that
they let you choose?

311
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:37,475
Hanging or lethal. You
get to pick your poison.

312
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:38,842
Literally.

313
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,681
Which one would you choose?

314
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,918
Medically speaking,
which one's...

315
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,588
better?

316
00:19:54,644 --> 00:19:56,744
Well, with hanging,

317
00:19:56,846 --> 00:19:59,446
your neck breaks, which
severs your spinal cord,

318
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:04,067
which causes blood pressure to
drop, and you lose consciousness.

319
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:07,003
You don't actually
die for several minutes.

320
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:09,273
And with lethal injection,

321
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:13,560
they inject an anesthetic
first which puts you to sleep,

322
00:20:13,662 --> 00:20:17,431
and then a paralytic which
stops your diaphragm and lungs.

323
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:20,801
And then potassium,
which stops your heart.

324
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:34,231
Was... was I a match?

325
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:38,735
Yes, you were.

326
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:06,814
Can I help you with something?
Were you looking for Dr. Shep...?

327
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:10,401
- Are you a good girl?
- I... What?

328
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:15,189
A good girl. I don't mean perfect,
I mean... relatively speaking.

329
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:18,458
- Are you?
- Yes.

330
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:22,896
How many sexual partners
have you had? I won't judge.

331
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:25,732
Um, six. No, s-seven.

332
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:28,102
Kinda six, kinda seven.

333
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,253
- Criminal record?
- Speeding ticket.

334
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,055
- How fast?
- Twelve miles over.

335
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:36,510
- That's fast.
- It isn't too... Way too fast.

336
00:21:36,612 --> 00:21:40,164
But it was downhill. I
was coasting, ma'am.

337
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,027
I don't suppose
you can tell me...

338
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:48,489
where the gift shop is?

339
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,558
First floor, east wing.

340
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:03,688
- It's like pudding in here.
- It's why I don't do
this procedure.

341
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:08,892
You're living with broken legs for
months, you're in excruciating pain.

342
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,162
All for a few inches.

343
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:15,115
Pain and agony for a
little bit of pleasure. I get it.

344
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:18,319
If it's that bad, why
don't you just stop sleep...

345
00:22:20,189 --> 00:22:24,208
- doing what you're doing?
- It doesn't feel bad
when I'm...

346
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,511
doing it. It's good. It's great.

347
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:33,050
And maybe if you weren't so scared
of getting burned you'd feel the same.

348
00:22:35,204 --> 00:22:38,088
I used to walk tall around here.

349
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,740
I used to walk tall.

350
00:22:40,843 --> 00:22:43,610
Then came George.

351
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,513
He took off at least an inch.

352
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:50,534
And Erica went and left me.
That shaved off a few more.

353
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:52,352
I got shorter.

354
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:56,323
All that humiliation makes you shorter.
So, yeah, I am scared of getting hurt.

355
00:22:56,425 --> 00:23:00,327
One more personal disaster right
now would cut me off at the knees.

356
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,170
So Valentine's Day.

357
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:13,139
Personally, I think you
can't go wrong with jewelry.

358
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:16,743
- I could recommend some places.
- What is wrong with you?

359
00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:20,131
- What?
- We just took
a liver and intestine

360
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,532
from a little kid.
A dead little kid.

361
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:24,201
And you don't even care.

362
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:28,489
You're talking about rainbows
and relationships and crap.

363
00:23:28,591 --> 00:23:30,524
What the hell is wrong with you?

364
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,749
You don't think I know they
just pulled the plug on a kid?

365
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:41,251
You don't think I get that?

366
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:47,091
You don't think I know about the tiny,
tiny coffin they're gonna stick him in?

367
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:49,471
I know about the tiny coffins.

368
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:53,280
I see them all the
time. In my sleep.

369
00:23:53,382 --> 00:23:56,433
So if you don't mind,
I'm gonna keep talking

370
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:59,837
relationships and
rainbows and crap,

371
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:03,340
and I'm gonna make
plans for tomorrow.

372
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:08,696
Because that's what you
do, Karev. You make plans.

373
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:14,718
You have to. You turn your back
on the tiny coffins and face forward.

374
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,654
To the next kid.

375
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:26,679
- How's our death-row guy?
- Pissing me off.

376
00:24:26,782 --> 00:24:29,283
Blossoming brain
contusions, refusing surgery.

377
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:33,387
- Thinks he'll get
a stay of execution?
- No, he'd like to die here.

378
00:24:33,489 --> 00:24:35,773
He wants to control
it. He wants to choose.

379
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:38,425
I went overboard buying
bears for your nieces.

380
00:24:38,527 --> 00:24:40,627
- Mom, this is Major Owen Hunt.
- Major?

381
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,848
I was a Navy nurse for 25
years. Where were you stationed?

382
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,466
- In the thick of it. In Iraq.
- Welcome home.

383
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:51,304
- You must have stories.
- Not any worth telling, ma'am.

384
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:59,079
- I finished your post-ops.
- Thank you, Dr. Yang.

385
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,639
- What was
your best surgery ever?
- What?

386
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:11,275
Nothing. Uh, stupid.

387
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:16,163
- Finishing the vena cava.
- Anastomosis looks good.

388
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:18,849
All that's left is to
release the clamps.

389
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:23,336
You should do the honors,
Miranda. He's your patient.

390
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,759
Thank you, Dr. Robbins.

391
00:25:41,657 --> 00:25:43,790
Call on me.

392
00:25:46,095 --> 00:25:47,394
Call on me.

393
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:49,713
Call on me!

394
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:55,502
There's a spot on the duodenum.

395
00:25:55,604 --> 00:25:57,938
What the hell is that?

396
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,890
- I don't feel good.
- ICP is critical. We can't wait.

397
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:04,127
- We have to get him
down to the OR.
- No. No.

398
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,831
- We have to get you to surgery.
- I'm not scared of dying.

399
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:13,604
I just don't want to do it strapped
down on a table like some animal.

400
00:26:14,723 --> 00:26:17,257
Please... Please, Dr. Grey.

401
00:26:18,728 --> 00:26:20,260
Let me go.

402
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:29,436
OK, start bagging him.

403
00:26:29,538 --> 00:26:32,056
- Intubate, get him into the OR.
- Yeah, right here.

404
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:35,492
I need another doctor's
signature, consent to operate.

405
00:26:36,245 --> 00:26:37,527
Meredith, sign.

406
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:39,871
Sign the form.

407
00:26:41,334 --> 00:26:42,899
Meredith, sign the form!

408
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,620
Meredith, sign the form!

409
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,876
Yang, you're scrubbing in.

410
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:04,237
He's clotting and clotting
and clotting. Is there a source?

411
00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:07,691
This can't be happening.
Not to this little boy.

412
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,710
- This is not happening...
- These organs are dead.

413
00:27:10,812 --> 00:27:13,864
They're making him sicker.
Keeping them in is doing harm.

414
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:17,233
- He will die if you
leave them in.
- He'll die if we take them out!

415
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:19,002
Pressure's dropping.

416
00:27:20,522 --> 00:27:23,640
Try a portacaval shunt.
It'll bypass the liver.

417
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,944
- That's a temporary fix.
- Got any better ideas?

418
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,197
I don't see what choice we have.

419
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:32,349
How much time
to find new organs?

420
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:34,801
Twenty-four hours.

421
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,854
Get some more laps in here too.

422
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:43,360
We're going to put this piece of
skull in Mr. Dunn's abdomen. Why?

423
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:45,963
To allow the swelling
in the brain to resolve.

424
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:49,666
Circulation of abdomen preserves
the bone marrow in the skull piece.

425
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:53,102
- Very good.
- Thanks for
letting me scrub in.

426
00:27:53,188 --> 00:27:56,990
I guess we finally see
eye to eye on something.

427
00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:03,446
Are we ever gonna find
out why it clotted off?

428
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:06,950
Sometimes the body,
the pieces just break.

429
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,673
- I'm like that.
- Yeah? You dying for no reason?

430
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:19,229
My life is in pieces,
all of the time.

431
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:24,301
And they keep breaking, and as soon
as I fix one, another one goes down.

432
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:28,855
I'm not trying to piss you off.
I'm just trying to keep it together.

433
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,723
Piece by piece.

00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:20,340
- She's a lovely girl.
- A lovely girl
who's off-limits.

444
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:23,576
Baloney. She isn't
the problem, you are.

445
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:26,780
You have very low expectations
for yourself, Mark Sloan.

446
00:29:26,882 --> 00:29:30,483
Since you were a little boy.
And it's time to raise them.

447
00:29:30,585 --> 00:29:32,219
She's 24.

448
00:29:32,321 --> 00:29:37,024
You have the emotional maturity of
a horny 15 year old. You need young.

449
00:29:37,126 --> 00:29:39,108
Mm.

450
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:44,814
We had to shave off a quarter inch
of leg bone in order to save the legs.

451
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:47,968
You mean I'm shorter?

452
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,437
I'm a quarter of
an inch shorter?

453
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,956
Quarter inch.
It's not a big deal.

454
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,661
Yeah. I'm under 5'3".

455
00:29:57,763 --> 00:30:00,397
I am 5'2" and three quarters.

456
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:04,367
But maybe I can still just squeeze
over the height requirement

457
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,003
- at the amusement park.
- Do you know

458
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,625
why I never played
varsity basketball?

459
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:14,744
- You didn't make the team?
- No. I didn't try out
for the team.

460
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:18,682
I didn't want to make you feel
bad for being too short to play.

461
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:21,935
Even now, if I have a bad
day, I can't talk to my brother

462
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:24,955
because maybe you had
a bad day and you're short!

463
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:28,625
I couldn't even be depressed
about Lori leaving me

464
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:31,678
because you don't have a
girlfriend and you're short!

465
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,448
By the way, the reason
you don't have a girlfriend

466
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:37,417
isn't because you're
short. It's because all you do

467
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:40,003
is talk about being short!

468
00:30:42,024 --> 00:30:45,325
No one knows how short
you are except for you, dude.

469
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,327
No one cares.

470
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,671
- I'm an ass, aren't I?
- Yeah.

471
00:30:59,074 --> 00:31:01,441
And you're short.

472
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:07,230
Good night. Nice to meet you.

473
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:10,199
Major Hunt? How
have you been sleeping?

474
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,836
- I'm sorry?
- When I can't sleep,

475
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:14,371
I use Valerian root.

476
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:17,790
I know you doctors don't think
much of herbs, but I find it helps.

477
00:31:17,892 --> 00:31:21,677
Have you been sleeping?
Since you came back?

478
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:27,750
I'm fine, ma'am.
I... sleep just fine.

479
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,987
Good night.

480
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:38,044
- How's your head feel,
Mr. Dunn?
- Why didn't you just let me go?

481
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:41,781
- You're not dying here.
- What are you so scared of?

482
00:31:41,883 --> 00:31:45,385
- Losing control?
- ICP's stable. Continue neuro exams.

483
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:49,456
Keep an eye on his blood
pressure. I don't want it dropping.

484
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:53,426
Or maybe you know deep
down, you're no better than I am.

485
00:31:53,528 --> 00:31:56,229
You decide who lives
and dies all the time.

486
00:31:56,331 --> 00:32:00,183
For you, they call it
medicine, not a capital offense.

487
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:05,505
Nobody gets to choose. Not
me, not a patient in this hospital

488
00:32:05,607 --> 00:32:08,141
and certainly not the
women you slaughtered.

489
00:32:08,243 --> 00:32:11,010
So when I say you're not
gonna die in this hospital,

490
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:17,167
I mean there is no way in hell
I will let you die in this hospital.

491
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:21,388
You don't get off that easy.

492
00:32:23,492 --> 00:32:25,392
I'm nothing like you.

493
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,252
Meredith.

494
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:38,921
I was just looking for Derek.
I thought you'd be with him.

495
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,711
You seem like a
very nice person.

496
00:32:44,813 --> 00:32:48,448
You've been kind and
you've given me a chance.

497
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,618
It seems like you
want to like me.

498
00:32:52,788 --> 00:32:56,456
So it's only fair
you should know...

499
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,460
the pink and the ponytail
and the smiling with the teeth?

500
00:33:01,363 --> 00:33:03,480
I'm a fraud. It's fake.

501
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:07,283
I'm not the kind of girl mothers
like. I'm not happy and bubbly.

502
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,502
I'm dark and cloudy,

503
00:33:09,604 --> 00:33:13,139
because I'm the type
of crazy person who...

504
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,426
feels bad for serial killers.

505
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,300
It was very nice to
meet you, Meredith.

00:33:49,812 --> 00:33:52,813
- I want to meet your mother.
- Iz.

510
00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:57,133
I want to go on a date with you. I
want to eat dinner in a restaurant

511
00:33:57,235 --> 00:34:00,537
and not look like a crazy
person talking to myself.

512
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:04,608
I want to walk down the street
with you and hold your hand.

513
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:08,011
I want to tell my friends

518
00:34:31,053 --> 00:34:32,785
I think I am.

519
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:43,080
- So you wanna get a drink?
- I would, but I have plans.

520
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,482
Right.

00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:51,905
- Walk tall.
- What?

522
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:57,043
All you can do is be brave
enough to get out there.

523
00:34:57,145 --> 00:35:00,129
You fought. You loved.

524
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,781
You lost.

525
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,284

They closed the kitchen.

528
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,948
I didn't want you to
think I stood you up.

529
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:23,403
Are you drunk?

530
00:35:26,574 --> 00:35:31,044
I haven't been on a date in five
years, since before I entered the military.

531
00:35:31,146 --> 00:35:33,864
- I wanted to take the edge off.
- You're late and drunk?

532
00:35:33,948 --> 00:35:37,283
I will make this up to you. I
promise. This is not what you deserve.

533
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:41,454
This is not what you deserve. I
will make this up to you. I promise.

534
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,608
Before you say anything
else, Dr. Goodtimes, shower.

535
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,359
You smell like a distillery.

536
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,782
No. Not here! I...

537
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:59,623
Your father always wanted
you to have this for the right girl.

538
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:03,560
Addy wasn't right, clearly.

539
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,616
You spent less than
an hour with Meredith.

540
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:16,772
- You barely even know her.
- I know enough.

541
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:22,412
I know it's easier to have compassion
for a good person than a murderer.

542
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,748
I know how angry
you still are about Dad.

543
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,651
Of course I'm angry.

544
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,655
Aren't you?

545
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,195
I still can't sleep on
his side of the bed,

546
00:36:38,297 --> 00:36:42,465
the mattress is
wearing unevenly,

547
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:44,767
but no.

548
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:47,971
No, not angry. Not anymore.

549
00:36:50,993 --> 00:36:53,159
Sweetheart...

550
00:36:54,896 --> 00:36:58,098
- You see things
in black and white.
- Mm.

551
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,550
Meredith doesn't.

552
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:03,703
You need a spoonful of that.

553
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,605
You need her.

554
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,143
- She's the one.
- Yeah.

555
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,871
Yang! Yang!

556
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:29,011
- I thought of my best surgery.
- You're wearing shoes in my
shower.

557
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:32,165
First blast injury in the
field. Body was mangled.

558
00:37:32,267 --> 00:37:37,087
Homemade explosive device, wires
embedded five inches in the abdomen.

559
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:41,074
Arms and legs hanging on by threads
of skin. Never seen anything like it.

560
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:45,828
Not in a textbook, not in residency.
Incredible. Body full of holes.

561
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,732
Trauma surgeon's dream. I
put tourniquets on where I could,

562
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:53,703
started tying off arteries with my bare
hands, but bleeding was everywhere:

563
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:56,038
stomach, chest...

564
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,309
Best pressure I could
think of was my own body.

565
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:02,912
I laid there for two hours
on top of him, not moving,

566
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:08,751
trying to keep that dam from
bursting with my hands, knees, elbows.

567
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:12,822
Body... full of holes,

568
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:15,374
and... he never bled out.

569
00:38:15,476 --> 00:38:18,477
I wouldn't let him.

570
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:22,916
He made it to the hospital, home.
A month later, he sent me a letter

571
00:38:23,018 --> 00:38:25,752
thanking me for saving his
life. Then he shot himself.

572
00:38:34,695 --> 00:38:37,196
That was my best surgery.

trip, stop in Iowa, see some corn.

- Yeah.

589

I think she'd like to meet you.

590
00:39:39,994 --> 00:39:44,430
Or not. Bad idea. Forget it.

591
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:55,174
There's a bottle of tequila in the
laundry room that has our name on it.

592
00:39:55,276 --> 00:39:57,360
Don't move.

593
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,375
Alex...

594
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:15,511

I'm so sorry, I just heard.
What happens now?

599
00:40:28,376 --> 00:40:31,244
Now, we wait for a miracle.

600
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:39,552
<i>So we struggle
over every stitch,</i>

601
00:40:39,654 --> 00:40:42,088
<i>we agonize...</i>

602
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,877
<i>over every suture.</i>

603
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:56,820
During surgery, Dr. Shepherd
removed a piece of your skull.

604
00:40:56,922 --> 00:40:59,555
Which means your brain is
only covered by dura mater.

605
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:04,877
It's virtually exposed. If somehow
that area were to be damaged,

606
00:41:04,979 --> 00:41:09,215
it would cause intracranial bleeding,
which could cause your brain to swell

607
00:41:09,317 --> 00:41:14,804
worse than it did today, which
would result in brain death.

608
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:20,059
So, as your doctor, I need you to
be very careful not to damage it.

609
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:23,552
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

610
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:35,007
Dr. Grey?

611
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:40,596
Are you doing
this for the kid...

612
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:42,031
or for me?

613
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:44,033
<i>Because the snap judgments,</i>

614
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:48,437
<i>the ones that come to us quickly
and easily, without hesitation...</i>

615
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,840
Whatever helps
you sleep at night.

616
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:54,243
<i>They're the ones
that haunt us forever.</i>
