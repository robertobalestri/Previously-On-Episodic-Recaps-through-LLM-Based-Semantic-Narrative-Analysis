1
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,713
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:04,915
- I passed?
- You're not an intern
anymore.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:06,499
George doesn't know I exist.

4
00:00:06,523 --> 00:00:09,035
- Want to go on a date with me?
- - What if I'm not into it?

5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,571
- I won't let you do this to me.
- - I know I'm being an ass.

6
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:12,961
I found a way to save lives.

7
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:14,841
I could find patients
for a clinical trial.

8
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:16,926
Tumor's shrinking,
the virus is working.

9
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,461
- You keep a diary?
- It's not mine.

10
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:20,605
- Whose is it?
- Your mother's.

11
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:28,226
<i>"I am a rock, I am an island."</i>

12
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:33,298
<i>That's the mantra of pretty
much every surgeon I've ever met.</i>

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,369
<i>We like to think we're
independent. Loners. Mavericks.</i>

14
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:41,439
<i>That all we need to do our job is
an OR, a scalpel and a willing body.</i>

15
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,541
Is Yang on call tonight?

16
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:46,361
Yeah, why do you think
it's so clean in here?

17
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,881
<i>But the truth is, not even
the best of us can do it alone.</i>

18
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,517
<i>Surgery, like life,
is a team sport.</i>

19
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,521
Can I just say, the whole
"taking it slow" thing?

20
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,457
Best idea ever.

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,293
- It really takes
the pressure off.
- Mm...

22
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,929
Yeah, we can just...
hang out without all the...

23
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,563
The expectations.

24
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,433
- Why rush things?
- Exactly.

25
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:12,604
<i>And eventually you've got to
get off the bench and decide...</i>

26
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:17,675
<i>what team are you batting for?</i>

27
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,722
<i>♪ Sad boy, you
stare up at the sky ♪</i>

28
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,658
- Hey.
- Hey.

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,794
One of the joys of co-habitation
is having breakfast together.

30
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:39,097
I can't because Bailey
paged us in early.

31
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:43,084
Guess you don't have time to look
at our work in a major medical journal.

32
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,687
They published
our clinical trial?

33
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:49,858
It's on the cover. "A new method in
treating inoperable malignant gliomas.

34
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,944
The Shepherd Method."

35
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:55,347
- What do you think?
- It's a picture,
a big picture of you.

36
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,350
- You're making a face.
- I'm not making a face.

37
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,320
I love that picture.
I have to go.

38
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,823
The Shepherd Method.

39
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:07,792
It's about time this hospital got
some good publicity for a change.

40
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:10,028
- I heard you found a donor.
- Yes, sir.

41
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,548
Last piece of the
puzzle fell into place.

42
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,399
This is the day, Dr. Bailey,

43
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,968
the day that Seattle Grace
comes back swinging.

44
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,470
Shepherd on the front
page of a national journal,

45
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,557
bragging rights
to a flashy surgery.

46
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:24,642
I don't see Mercy West taking on
a project of this magnitude, do you?

47
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,913
I'd rather wait to celebrate
till we pull this thing off.

48
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,581
Good call. We
don't want to jinx it.

49
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:38,524
Eat that, Mercy West.

50
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:42,911
God, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

51
00:02:43,013 --> 00:02:46,047
I had an early
morning palatoplasty.

52
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:51,019
- See this? The Shepherd Method?
- Yeah, impressive. Listen, last night Erica...

53
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:54,550
Think they airbrush these pictures?
The man does not have one pore.

54
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,391
Could you focus? I
need you right now.

55
00:02:56,493 --> 00:03:00,462
I'm a little exhausted, but if you
want to hop on and do all the work...

56
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:04,333
No. I need to talk.

57
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:07,518
Last night, Erica and I...

58
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,387
we...

59
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,157
We did it. Sort of.

60
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:15,627
- Congratulations.
- No. No, no.

61
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,762
It was not good, at all.

62
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,948
I choked.

63
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,501
I... couldn't go down there.

64
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:27,589
I tried, but it just felt so weird
and clinical, like gynie rotation.

65
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:33,111
I left this morning before she
got up. I couldn't even face her.

66
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,880
What if... What if me and
Erica, what if we are a mistake?

67
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,483
- Where are you going?
- I can't talk about this.

68
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,987
Come on! You love talking
about this stuff. Girl on girl, it's hot.

69
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:44,689
Two girls getting nasty
and loving it? That's hot.

70
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:49,127
One girl talking about how much
it sucked? Depressing, and wrong.

71
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,929
Just wrong.

72
00:03:53,717 --> 00:03:56,401
The chief wants us to give
George one of our interns?

73
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,253
Except for Grey. She already lost
O'Malley. Dump your dead weight.

74
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:02,891
They're all dead weight. That's
why I need all four, not three.

75
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:12,345
George is filling out paperwork,
getting his real-life doctor wings.

76
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:14,781
Now would be a good
time to decorate his locker.

77
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:17,417
- Give me that coffee.
- - I don't want the credit,

78
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:20,809
but the clinical trial was my
idea. I had to beg him to do it.

79
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:23,361
It's OK you want
the credit. I would.

80
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,325
Screw the attendings, you get
screwed. They have the power.

81
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,832
You could screw interns.

82
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,936
I mean, date.

83
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:35,357
Residents could date interns
'cause we're non-threatening.

84
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,944
I read this study once, interns hardly
ever file sexual harassment claims

85
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:43,131
because we feel so weak and
powerless in the hospital environment.

86
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,703
Interns: the other white meat.

87
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,785
- Where are we going?
- You'll see when
we get there.

88
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:54,754
I'm on Dr. Sloan's
service today.

89
00:04:54,778 --> 00:04:57,279
Everyone's off their
services. You're all with me.

90
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,942
- Where are we going?
- - You'll see when we get there.

91
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,206
See your locker? I
put a smelly candle.

92
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,580
Your scrubs are gonna
smell like cinnamon bun.

93
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,438
Dr. Sloan is doing a
transpalatal advancement.

94
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,041
Hahn said I could scrub
in on her aortic bypass.

95
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,195
I need to get to the clinic.
I'm the only doctor on call.

96
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:15,030
I've got administrative work...

97
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:18,749
Today is not about you. It is not
about whose services you wish to be on,

98
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,601
it's not about your career.

99
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:24,022
This is about me. This is a project
I've been working on for a long time,

100
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:27,675
and it's very important to me,
therefore it will be important to you.

101
00:05:27,777 --> 00:05:31,579
The only way we can pull this thing
off is if we work together as a team.

102
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:34,182
So today you are not
15 individual doctors,

103
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:37,518
you are one team of surgeons
representing this hospital.

104
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:39,887
Is everybody clear on that?

105
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,677
Why would they need so
many doctors for one surgery?

106
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:49,180
Because it's not just one
surgery, it's 12 surgeries.

107
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:54,720
Six kidney transplants in
six ORs, all at the same time.

108
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,606
Paired matching kidney donation.

109
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:01,910
It's a six-way swap. Six people
donate kidneys to total strangers,

110
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:04,479
six people get kidneys
from total strangers.

111
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:06,748
Twelve people walk away happy.

112
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,834
- Paired matching
kidney donations.
- Otherwise known as...

113
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,169
A domino surgery.

114
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,855
Stan Mercer, 46. Chronic renal
failure secondary to high blood pressure.

115
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:34,659
His wife wanted to donate a
kidney to him but she wasn't a match,

116
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:38,029
so she will be donating her
kidney to Ms. Chen over there,

117
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:43,234
who is a match, while Mr. Mercer will
be getting a kidney from this young man.

118
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,370
Nice to meet you.

119
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,622
PJ.

120
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:51,109
Please.

121
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:55,831
Kurt Walling, 58. Chronic renal
failure secondary to diabetes.

122
00:06:55,933 --> 00:07:00,702
His son PJ wasn't a match, so
Mr. Walling will get Ms. Herman's kidney.

123
00:07:00,804 --> 00:07:03,488
- Thanks for
the kidney, Ms. Herman.
- Call me Lindsay.

124
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,457
We'll be pretty close
by the end of the day.

125
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:07,470
And so on. Why do
you still look stupid?

126
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,439
Maybe if we had a cheat sheet.

127
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:13,431
Ms. Herman gives her kidney to Mr. Walling.
His son's kidney to Mr. Mercer.

128
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:17,185
Mr. Mercer's wife gives hers to Ms.
Chen. Chen's sister gives her kidney

129
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:20,571
to Mr. Patel. Mr. Patel's wife
gives her kidney to Ms. Loring,

130
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:23,753
who came in with her cousin Ms. Gomez,
who's giving her kidney to Mr. Cross,

131
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,017
the professional flautist.

132
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,728
For those without a
photographic memory,

133
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,863
it's on a board in
the conference room.

134
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:31,916
Why do we have to do all
six transplants at one time?

135
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,001
So no one backs
out at the last minute.

136
00:07:34,104 --> 00:07:36,516
Why would they? It's an
incredible thing to be part of.

137
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,551
Passing the
organ's kinda creepy.

138
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:41,242
That's why this whole
surgery is a house of cards.

139
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:43,511
If we lose one donor,
we lose them all.

140
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:46,548
So you will not only provide
excellent medical care,

141
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,468
but keep your patients happy. We
need to make sure this doesn't fall apart

142
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,420
before the surgery.
Any questions?

143
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:54,617
I heard when they did
the domino at Boston Gen

144
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:58,201
the residents got to keep one of the
dead kidneys in a jar as a souvenir.

145
00:07:58,295 --> 00:08:00,312
- I want a kidney.
- Can I have a kidney?

146
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:03,365
- If they get kidneys,
I get a kidney.
- I asked first.

147
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:05,683
No one is taking
home a kidney in a jar.

148
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:10,005
Diseased kidneys are not tchotchkes
for your coffee table. Now go, go.

149
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:19,380
- Hey, you OK?
- Uh...

150
00:08:19,483 --> 00:08:22,433
Bailey snagged all the
surgical residents and interns

151
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:25,503
so I'm stuck with the psych
interns. Not the sharpest.

152
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:29,490
You're busy. I'll be brief. I was
thinking if you weren't on call tonight

153
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,992
that maybe we
could go to my place,

154
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,063
order in dinner, rent a movie.

155
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:37,665
Tonight? You want to
get together again tonight?

156
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:41,136
- Well, I had a lot
of fun last night.
- Fun.

157
00:08:41,238 --> 00:08:43,504
Anyway, just let me know.

158
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:48,276
OK, as you may know, one of
you is going to O'Malley today.

159
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:52,263
- Me! I'll go,
if you need a volunteer.
- I decide who gets to go

160
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,527
after I decide which one
of you sucks the most.

161
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:57,671
You better not suck on
purpose because I will know.

162
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:01,184
Would you like your book or some
music, something to help you relax?

163
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,092
- Maybe some water.
- How about some
ice chips instead?

164
00:09:04,194 --> 00:09:06,088
Your ankles are looking thick.

165
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,680
My wife loves tracking
my fluid retention.

166
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,269
And Megan, will you please
come over here and tape the needle

167
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:18,489
- so we can start dialysis.
- Sounds just like
a real doctor.

168
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:25,013
It says here that you don't have a
loved one in the domino, Ms. Herman.

169
00:09:25,115 --> 00:09:27,615
- No.
- So you're just
donating a kidney

170
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:31,235
- to a complete
stranger for nothing?
- It's really no big deal.

171
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,105
I have two kidneys and they
say you can live with one.

172
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,858
That's amazing what you're doing.
UNOS is always short on organs.

173
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,427
If everyone in
the world did this...

174
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:41,541
It'd be all peace,
love and unicorns.

175
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:45,399
- She gets it, Grey.
- I'm so sick of all
the "yay, you."

176
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,168
I totally understand.

177
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:55,888
The chief has got me doing
press all day with journalists.

178
00:09:55,912 --> 00:09:58,896
- My face is hurting
from smiling.
- I already pushed that.

179
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,799
- Comes faster when I push it.
- - Oh, that Shepherd Method.

180
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,367
Funny.

181
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,019
I'll take the stairs.

182
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:08,189
- Are you bothered by this?
- - Why would I be bothered?

183
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,608
You can't call it the
Shepherd-Grey Method

184
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,445
because then people
would think you had help.

185
00:10:14,631 --> 00:10:16,580
I have to give my
kidney to that old guy?

186
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,651
- Mr. Mercer
couldn't be more than 50.
- My son's 22.

187
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:22,803
To him, everyone over
40's on the brink of death.

188
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:25,406
- I turned 23 in August.
- That's right.

189
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:28,909
Maybe we could have a little
belated party here in the hospital.

190
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:31,496
We'll get an ice cream
cake, you used to love those.

191
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,230
Yeah, when I was seven.

192
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:37,285
I'm not here for a reunion. I want
to get this over with and get out.

193
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,505
So you are on dialysis
four times a week now?

194
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:43,458
They might as well chain me
to the machine at this point.

195
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,577
My kidneys are shot. I'm
living on borrowed time.

196
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,781
So I'm pretty lucky to have a
son who would do this for me.

197
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,749
You're lucky you're loaded.

198
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:55,120
When do I get the 10,000
bucks, before or after the surgery?

199
00:10:58,474 --> 00:10:59,873
It's a Christmas gift.

200
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:03,311
It's October.

201
00:11:09,152 --> 00:11:12,920
<i>Dr. Bradford, labor and
delivery. Labor and delivery.</i>

202
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,958
I see you two hovering.

203
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,829
Hypothetically, say a patient
was paying his son for a kidney,

204
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:24,348
what exactly would happen?

205
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,803
- Paying money,
for a kidney.
- Hypothetically.

206
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:35,142
Well, as someone who stole an
organ herself not that long ago,

207
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:38,662
you should know, what
would happen is your patient

208
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,798
would be out of the exchange.

209
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:44,018
Which means that this person,

210
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,105
since her husband's no longer
getting a kidney, would drop out.

211
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,408
Then they'd drop out,
then they'd drop out,

212
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,812
then the whole thing would
fall apart, that's what'd happen.

213
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:57,498
So if you both are suggesting
that's what's going on here,

214
00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:00,351
you'd better be
damn sure about it.

215
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,507
It's just a gift, an
early stocking stuffer.

216
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:10,478
Most girls your age,
they're busy shopping.

217
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,247
You're in the hospital
giving a kidney to a stranger.

218
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,590
I'm not such a saint.

219
00:12:14,617 --> 00:12:16,835
Your kidney may not go
directly to my husband,

220
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:19,404
but you're one of the
people saving his life today.

221
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,088
To me, you're Mother Teresa.

222
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:24,758
Honey, do you mind running and
getting a wet wash cloth for me?

223
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,261
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

224
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:29,697
My mother invented the
Grey Method all by herself.

225
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:34,351
Maybe you should stop reading her
diary. It's gonna make you feel inadequate.

226
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:38,355
She's dead and in the
past and still outpacing me.

227
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,808
OK, see that intern over there?

228
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,027
- Is he clean?
- Huh? What?

229
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:46,147
I was thinking what Lexopedia
said. She may be onto something.

230
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:48,232
You're gonna
sleep with an intern?

231
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,795
It'd just be
scratching the itch.

232
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:52,047
It's been a long time.

233
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,638
I can't do this.

234
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,969
All these people telling me how
wonderful, selfless and giving I am.

235
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:59,539
I can't take it anymore,
especially not from her.

236
00:12:59,563 --> 00:13:01,607
- Keep your voice down.
- Did you see her face,

237
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:05,683
thanking me for saving
your life? Stan, this is crazy.

238
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,863
You promised you'd tell her!

239
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,488
- Mr. Mercer, everything OK?
- I don't feel so good.

240
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:14,192
Tell her! If the past three years
have meant anything to you,

241
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,477
- you have to tell her!
- Stan?

242
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:24,719
I'm not an idiot. I know there've been
other women. I've told myself just sex.

243
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:28,572
It's just... My God, Stan.
She's giving a kidney for you.

244
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:31,008
That's not sex, it's family.

245
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,228
All right, his cardiac
enzymes and EKG look good.

246
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,064
He had an acute anxiety
attack. I can clear him for surgery.

247
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:40,000
I do everything for you.
I've given up my entire life

248
00:13:40,102 --> 00:13:43,270
to get you to dialysis,
drive you to the doctors...

249
00:13:43,372 --> 00:13:44,972
I didn't ask you
to do any of that.

250
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,975
I can drive a car, I
can pour my own juice.

251
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:52,030
- I got sick, not elderly.
- Well, don't worry.

252
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:54,009
I won't do one
more thing for you,

253
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,617
and that includes
giving a kidney.

254
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,175
Get on the phone with UNOS,
tell them we need a kidney

255
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:07,595
- that matches
Mrs. Mercer's antibodies.
- UNOS is a longshot.

256
00:14:07,697 --> 00:14:10,298
It's the only shot we
have. Now go. Now!

257
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:20,958
She's barely a second-year
resident. I made the virus.

258
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:25,029
She assisted. When Michael Jordan
scores no one cares about the assist.

259
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,681
- I don't know. Scottie Pippen.
- You know what I mean.

260
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,184
These women, they
overthink everything.

261
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,286
Somebody's cranky today.

262
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:35,373
What's that, "experimental
treatments for cleft palates?"

263
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,342
You're working on
your own clinical trial.

264
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,162
- I'm just doing
a little research.
- Mm-hmm.

265
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:43,375
The very sight of me reminds you

266
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:48,102
that you've not made one worthwhile
contribution to medical history.

267
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:50,271
- Get out.
- You should read my article.

268
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:52,457
It'll enrich your life,
make you a better man.

269
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,879
I'm saving it for the bathroom.

270
00:14:56,496 --> 00:15:00,714
It started as an office
thing. You know, light, fun.

271
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,645
And then one day you wake up

272
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:07,438
and this older guy is
all you can think about.

273
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:11,308
You'd do anything for
him, even give a kidney.

274
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,314
Why?

275
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,682
I could save his life, too.

276
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:23,988
She may be married to him,
but I'm saving his life today too.

277
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,327
So then he'll finally
have to choose...

278
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,629
her or me.

279
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:39,636
Apparently Erica loved
it. The non-sex sex.

280
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:42,539
- I think she might want more.
- Happens to me all the time.

281
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:43,969
I barely remember,
their minds are blown.

282
00:15:43,993 --> 00:15:45,309
That's your sage advice?

283
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,612
I'm a world-class surgeon,
double boarded in plastics and ENT.

284
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:51,182
I have more meaningful
and worthwhile things to do

285
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,467
- than dispense sex advice.
- Like what?

286
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:55,953
- Nice.
- Come on. No, Mark.

287
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,406
- I need your help!
- Mm-hmm.

288
00:16:02,345 --> 00:16:04,078
Excuse me.

289
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:07,181
What is going on?

290
00:16:07,283 --> 00:16:10,534
We're trying to decide which
of our interns to give to George.

291
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,948
In front of us. They're
deciding in front of us,

292
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,124
- like livestock
at a state fair.
- I think I'll keep Lexopedia.

293
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:18,526
- She remembers many things.
- Mm-hmm.

294
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:21,562
And she bathes, which is
much more than I can say for...

295
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:24,898
stinky Two over there.

296
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,353
Well, Graciella charts like
crap, but she can put in a line.

297
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:33,040
Claire, on the other hand, nearly
castrated a guy with a catheter.

298
00:16:33,142 --> 00:16:35,510
We can hear you.

299
00:16:35,612 --> 00:16:37,177
I might dump Pierce.

300
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,920
- How does he suck?
- I just hate saying the name Pierce.

301
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:42,099
- Mmm...
- We should revolt.

302
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:45,036
They'd respect us more
if we didn't participate.

303
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,889
Yeah. You revolt first,

304
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,403
- and I'll follow.
- - Have you heard from UNOS?

305
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:53,560
They're still searching
for a match. So far nothing.

306
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:56,947
- I hope they come through. My guy needs a kidney.
- They all need kidneys.

307
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,878
If Derek needed a kidney
I wouldn't give him one.

308
00:16:59,902 --> 00:17:02,148
He'd say he magically
grew it himself.

309
00:17:02,172 --> 00:17:04,588
My guy's been sick for 15 years.

310
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,993
Can you imagine having your life on
hold like that? Plus he's got a crappy kid.

311
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:12,113
Hey! Did I say you
could put that down?

312
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,567
No, so pick it up.

313
00:17:16,653 --> 00:17:19,987
- Weak. No stamina.
- Yeah, but he takes orders.

314
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:22,706
True, true.

315
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,313
- Is my husband getting a kidney?
- - What about my sister?

316
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:32,583
If she's not getting a kidney, I am
not giving mine to some stranger.

317
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:36,136
I will do my best to make sure
everyone gets a kidney today.

318
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:39,640
I'll update you as soon as
I have information. Please.

319
00:17:40,877 --> 00:17:43,393
Sir, I've got this
under control.

320
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,257
I have Grey talking with UNOS...

321
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:48,048
We're being featured
on the national news.

322
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,018
All eyes are on Seattle Grace.

323
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,171
- Fix this.
- Yes, sir.

324
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,410
I've been poked and
prodded like a lab rat.

325
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:00,927
All for nothing?

326
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:04,415
We got to spend time with
each other. That's not nothing.

327
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:07,868
Oh, now you want to
spend time together.

328
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:12,006
Well, you're about 20 years
too late, so, yeah, nothing.

329
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:14,875
- PJ.
- - Do I still get the $10,000

330
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:17,711
if the surgery doesn't
happen? If not, I'm out of here.

331
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:22,316
- I have a life to get back to.
- Please. I need you.

332
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,538
If you could just be
patient a little bit longer.

333
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,598
I was gonna punch that kid.

334
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,834
What kind of a selfish idiot?
His father is sick, really sick,

335
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:42,570
all he cares about is his money.

336
00:18:42,672 --> 00:18:46,290
The guy must've done something
bad to make the kid so angry.

337
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:47,775
Maybe he cares about his son

338
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,611
but the moron is too
emotionally stunted to let him.

339
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,646
OK. I'm not...

340
00:18:52,748 --> 00:18:54,699
I'm trying to be... I am.

341
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:58,052
But this, right here? This...
This is exactly your problem.

342
00:18:58,154 --> 00:19:00,338
You get all wrapped
up and involved

343
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,323
and you just... You start
caring about these people.

344
00:19:03,426 --> 00:19:05,826
Your patient in
there, he's the moron.

345
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:08,690
His son's never gonna give him
what he wants. He'll be disappointed.

346
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:12,166
The sooner he gets that
the sooner you get it, and...

347
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,821
No. Go on, please.

348
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:19,923
Be a selfish ass. At least
then I know what to expect.

349
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:24,962
This being a decent guy one second
and total jerk the next is getting old.

350
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:27,615
So who's it gonna be? Pick one.

351
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:36,157
O'Malley. What's up, bud?

352
00:19:37,526 --> 00:19:40,961
Hey. Missed you at lunch today.
It was an all-new level of hell.

353
00:19:41,063 --> 00:19:44,431
I was busy doing my own charts.
The interns don't respect me.

354
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:46,712
I would respect you
if I was your intern.

355
00:19:46,736 --> 00:19:50,821
They don't respect you because
they're not scared of you. Decimate one.

356
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,074
It's not rocket science. Two!

357
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,596
Who's getting Ms.
Herman's kidney?

358
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,649
- Uh... I can go check.
- Three.

359
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:05,469
- Mr. Walling.
- That's right. I totally forgot.

360
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,022
Oh, you forgot.

361
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,491
Like you forgot to do
your notes before rounds?

362
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:13,343
Or like you forgot to pull the
drain on my post-op SBO?

363
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:17,030
Or like you forgot to sign all
your dictations so all your charts...

364
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,182
my charts... are delinquent?

365
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:20,885
You forgot?

366
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:24,237
The only thing you can retain
in that pea-sized brain of yours

367
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:26,106
is what time lunch is.

368
00:20:27,376 --> 00:20:29,309
Grey here is gonna
become a surgeon

369
00:20:29,411 --> 00:20:32,262
while you dig ditches
by the side of the road.

370
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,601
It's brutal, but it's effective.

371
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,826
- I'm not gonna do this.
- Do what?

372
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:50,330
Have this silent fight. I'll write the
editors, have them print a correction.

373
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:51,866
The Shepherd-Grey Method.

374
00:20:51,968 --> 00:20:55,085
I don't want you to give me
credit 'cause you're mad I'm mad.

375
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:58,622
Give me credit 'cause you think I
worked hard for it and deserve it.

376
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:02,025
You don't deserve
it. You're a baby.

377
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:05,224
You have the potential to be a
good surgeon, maybe a great one,

378
00:21:05,248 --> 00:21:08,682
but you haven't scratched the
surface on what you need to learn.

379
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:11,335
It was my idea.

380
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:15,056
And I hate that picture.

381
00:21:16,592 --> 00:21:19,793
<i>To thoracic surgery.</i>

382
00:21:20,896 --> 00:21:22,796
UNOS doesn't have a match.

383
00:21:30,673 --> 00:21:31,906
OK.

384
00:21:32,008 --> 00:21:35,275
Uh, we can, um...

385
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:39,797
We've been stalling, we haven't released
anyone. I can talk to Mrs. Mercer...

386
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:42,816
You can't do anything that
could be seen as coercion.

387
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:44,802
- UNOS is very clear.
- But, sir...

388
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:48,756
The last thing we need is to lose
our status as a transplant center.

389
00:21:52,128 --> 00:21:53,728
Let the patients go home.

390
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:58,632
It's over.

391
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:18,569
I've got a CABG in an hour.
Want to get some coffee?

392
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:21,338
I'm not cut out for this.

393
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,942
- Coffee?
- No, this, the touching
and the...

394
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:29,563
sex with a girl. I just... I can't
do it. I thought I could, but...

395
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:32,766
But you did do it.
I don't understand.

396
00:22:35,638 --> 00:22:37,004
Oh...

397
00:22:39,074 --> 00:22:41,892
It wasn't good for you.

398
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,271
I still can't believe it.

399
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,207
I got so close.

400
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:59,593
You'll be high on the transplant
list. Something else will come up.

401
00:22:59,695 --> 00:23:02,696
It's not the kidney
I'm upset about.

402
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,065
Oh, your son.

403
00:23:05,168 --> 00:23:06,850
We hadn't spoken in over a year.

404
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,453
It took me months to find him.

405
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,756
This was my chance
to get him back.

406
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,057
Right.

407
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,710
I know PJ can be selfish...

408
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:19,496
rude.

409
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,466
But it hasn't been easy for him.

410
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:26,536
His mom died.

411
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:29,273
I worked late most nights.

412
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:33,244
- I made a lot of mistakes.
- - You can't blame yourself.

413
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:35,779
Some people are just broken.

414
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:40,484
I guess you just try
not to care too much

415
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,026
and you can't be disappointed.

416
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:49,593
These are your discharge papers.

417
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,603
I'm sorry.

418
00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:03,723
I don't know why.

419
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,678
I'm sorry.

420
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,151
I'm so sorry.

421
00:24:17,073 --> 00:24:18,605
It's OK.

422
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:29,682
Now all you have to do is sign at
the bottom and you're free to go.

423
00:24:32,855 --> 00:24:35,289
You must think I'm
a terrible person...

424
00:24:36,091 --> 00:24:37,707
refusing to give my kidney.

425
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:42,062
- We're not thinking
anything, ma'am.
- He's taken everything.

426
00:24:42,164 --> 00:24:44,865
My love, my pride.

427
00:24:45,701 --> 00:24:49,219
My dignity. It's all gone.

428
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,189
But the one thing that he
doesn't have is the kidney.

429
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,861
And the thought of giving
him that last part of me.

430
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:02,666
You must think I'm
a terrible person.

431
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:04,996
I'm not allowed
to think anything.

432
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,855
There are rules that prevent
me from having an opinion here.

433
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:11,658
Good rules, rules
in place for a reason,

434
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,863
because giving an organ that God
put in your body to someone else

435
00:25:16,966 --> 00:25:20,117
isn't something that you
can be coerced into doing.

436
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:24,038
It is a big thing.

437
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,140
It is an extraordinary thing.

438
00:25:26,242 --> 00:25:30,610
It's a gift that must
be freely given.

439
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,931
And if you were to give it,
and I'm not asking you to,

440
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:40,187
but if you were to give it,
it's not just for your husband.

441
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:45,292
It's for five other people, people
that you don't know from Adam.

442
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:08,331
Our six donors are all
anesthetized and ready to go.

443
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,334
They'll be done first,
followed by the recipients.

444
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:14,071
Each pair will be color-coded
so as not to confuse them.

445
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:18,925
This surgery is a hornet's nest,
people, so work quickly but carefully.

446
00:26:19,028 --> 00:26:22,362
Use each other,
operate as a team.

447
00:26:22,464 --> 00:26:24,481
Let's go make medical history.

448
00:26:27,803 --> 00:26:30,103
We're lucky as hell that
woman changed her mind.

449
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:32,856
Yes, we are. Yes, we are.

450
00:26:35,744 --> 00:26:38,896
<i>♪ These quiet times ♪</i>

451
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:42,415

Huh. Now that's what I
call a nice-looking kidney.

453
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:02,448
Put that on ice and start flushing
in the preservation solution.

454

461
00:27:33,969 --> 00:27:36,269
You want to do the
honors, Dr. Yang?

462
00:27:38,473 --> 00:27:39,750
Good.

463
00:27:39,774 --> 00:27:41,742
Clamp coming off.

464
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,811
Oh! Oh...

465
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,413
That's quite a geyser of urine.

466
00:27:46,515 --> 00:27:48,493
That means we did our job right.

467
00:27:48,517 --> 00:27:51,001
You never get
tired of seeing that.

468
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,521
We're ready for you, Grey.

469
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,694
Walking with the kidney.

470
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:10,504
Five second rule!
Five second rule!

471
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,327
Hold it still. I'm
gonna need more ice.

472
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,780
- And another tie.
- I'll get it.

473
00:28:19,881 --> 00:28:22,532
No. You don't
touch anything else.

474
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:26,120
Someone dropped a damn kidney?!

475
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:35,762
I know. You don't want to talk
about it anymore. I know you're over it.

476
00:28:35,865 --> 00:28:39,616
- For the love of God!
- Just hear me out.

477
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:43,220
I like to be good at things, OK?

478
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:46,289
I do not fail, I do not quit.

479
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:50,677
I like to be good at things,
and I want to be good at this,

480
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:53,613
so... I need you.

481
00:28:54,616 --> 00:28:57,301
I need you to show me.

482
00:29:00,255 --> 00:29:01,688
Show you?

483
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:04,274
Because you didn't
publish a big clinical trial

484
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:06,616
doesn't mean
you're not a genius.

485
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:12,116
Fine. Take off your pants.

486
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:15,402
Really? Oh, my God, thank you!

487
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:19,056
- Thank you so much.
- I'll show you
the Sloan Method.

488
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:22,792
Will never be in a medical
journal, but it should.

489
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,100
Shouldn't it be
pinking up by now?

490
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,213
It's just getting venous blood.

491
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,477
Let's check the backside again.

492
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:38,642
I think I see a

493
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:42,012
All right, come on, come on.

494
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:45,031

Pink up, pink up, pink up.

498
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,346
Come on!

499
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:05,930
Yes! It looks good.

500
00:30:05,954 --> 00:30:07,620
We have a live kidney.

501
00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:20,901
Oh, come on, I am offering two
interns. Two for the price of one.

502
00:30:21,002 --> 00:30:24,905
- I'll trade you Laura
for both of 'em.
- Leo drains pus and likes it.

503
00:30:25,007 --> 00:30:28,808
I dropped an internal
organ. On the floor.

504
00:30:30,212 --> 00:30:32,795
- It happens.
- OK, OK.

505
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:36,283
How about this: Four goes
to George. I get James.

506
00:30:36,385 --> 00:30:39,553
Karev, you get
Two. Izzie gets Leo.

507
00:30:39,654 --> 00:30:41,404
What are you people doing?

508
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:47,627
We were just... deciding which
of our interns to give to George.

509
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:50,546
Oh, you think I got
to choose my interns,

510
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:54,952
and I picked you people 'cause
you're all such a surgical dream team?

511
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:57,904
You, you're lazy. You, whiny.

512
00:30:58,006 --> 00:31:00,957
Butterfingers over there,
downright depressing.

513
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:04,144
And you, Yang, you,
you're just annoying.

514
00:31:04,246 --> 00:31:06,596
Choosing their own interns.

515
00:31:06,682 --> 00:31:08,232
Wha...

516
00:31:10,752 --> 00:31:12,686
Give me those damn cards.

517
00:31:15,858 --> 00:31:18,892
O'Malley, you have interns.

518
00:31:22,597 --> 00:31:25,231
What is it?

519
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,904
OK, open his fluids,
Karev. Push a gram of Mag.

520
00:31:31,006 --> 00:31:34,157
Do a CBC and electrolytes.
Order a color flow doppler

521
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,793
- and do a full neuro workup.
- Think there's a bleed?

522
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,129
No way of knowing
until we evaluate.

523
00:31:39,214 --> 00:31:41,531

541
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:48,898
- Your dad just had a seizure.
- OK.

542
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,285
- So what does that mean?
- It means something's wrong.

543
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:56,373
It means he could be dying, and
he doesn't know you give a crap.

544
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:59,242
Honestly he doesn't know and
maybe you don't, but if you do,

545
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,928
he's dying and you'll be
too late. He's asking for you,

546
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,599
you're gonna be too late, you're
gonna live with it the rest of your life!

547
00:33:05,701 --> 00:33:07,717
You want to live

Yeah, O'Malley, you gotta chill.

554
00:33:31,526 --> 00:33:34,444
They probably should
say Dr. O'Malley.

555
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:37,747
So those are your interns?
Did you even ask for me?

556
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,149
- What?
- I helped you study.

557
00:33:41,203 --> 00:33:44,120

561
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,803

Ms. Loring and
Mr. Mercer, they're all stable.

- The press will be
all over this.

He has a serious complication.

570
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:42,262

- Who you're living with.

- Not "whatever." He's right.

"it happens" because it doesn't,

00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,790
We're trying this again.

663
00:40:18,266 --> 00:40:20,800

664
00:40:20,902 --> 00:40:23,436

665
00:40:23,538 --> 00:40:25,771
<i>isn't the worst
thing in the world.</i>

666
00:40:25,874 --> 00:40:27,240
What?

667
00:40:28,776 --> 00:40:30,159
I care about you.

668
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:35,464
I care about you, and
I'm not gonna go crazy,

669
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:37,433
and I'm not gonna
try to kill myself.

670
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:41,470
And I'm not gonna stop caring about
you no matter how hard you push me away.

671
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:45,791
- Shut up and
get out of my room.
- No.

672
00:40:46,594 --> 00:40:48,461
I care about you...

673
00:40:48,563 --> 00:40:52,198
and I know you care about me,
too, and it's not too late for us.

674
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,433
- Get out of my room.
- Admit it.

675
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:58,221
Admit that you care about
me, too. I know you do.

676
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:01,256
And I care about you.

677
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,660
I care about you.

678
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:07,379
I care about you.
I care about you.

679
00:41:07,481 --> 00:41:09,681
I care about you. I...

680
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:17,140
<i>So we watch from the
sidelines, clinging to our isolation.</i>

681
00:41:20,028 --> 00:41:22,461
- It glows.
- Yeah.

682
00:41:26,434 --> 00:41:30,769
When my mother was a resident
she wasn't dropping kidneys.

683
00:41:30,871 --> 00:41:34,107
- You're reading
your mom's diary?
- Mmm...

684
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,227
I'm not half the
surgeon my mother was.

687
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:51,040
<i>Because we know as soon

688
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:55,711
- Honey, you leaving already?
- There are no
real men left, Joe.

689
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:58,630
See ya.

690
00:41:58,732 --> 00:42:02,368
Hey. Shot and a beer. Whiskey.

691
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:05,655
Know what? Better make it just
the beer. I start work tomorrow.

692
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:09,509
<i>Someone comes along and
changes the game completely.</i>
