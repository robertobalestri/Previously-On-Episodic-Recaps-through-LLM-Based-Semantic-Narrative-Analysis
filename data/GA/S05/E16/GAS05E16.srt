1
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:15,213
<i>There's this thing that happens
when people find out you're a doctor.</i>

2
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:20,101
Good morning.

3
00:00:21,204 --> 00:00:25,340
Did you...

4
00:00:26,644 --> 00:00:30,095
- patter?
- Propose? No. Not yet.

5
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,246
You'll be the first to know.

6
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:36,134
<i>They stop seeing you as a person
and begin to see you as something</i>

7
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:39,487
<i>- bigger than you are.</i>
- How's she doing?

8
00:00:39,589 --> 00:00:42,140
She's, uh... OK.

9
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,409
She's OK.

10
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,995
<i>They have to see
us that way, as gods.</i>

11
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:49,814
<i>Otherwise we're just
like everyone else.</i>

12
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:53,301
<i>Unsure, flawed, normal.</i>

13
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,640
- How's she doing?
- No change. This is
the MCA Doppler?

14
00:00:58,742 --> 00:01:00,809
Yeah. Can I get you
anything? Coffee?

15
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:01,911
I'm fine, thanks.

16
00:01:02,012 --> 00:01:05,079
<i>So we act strong, remain stoic.</i>

17
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:09,818
<i>We hide the fact that
we're all too human.</i>

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,922
He still beating himself up? Addison
thinks he's still beating himself up.

19
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:16,290
- Alex...
- The head of Neuro hasn't left

20
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:18,894
- his patient's bedside
for three days.
- He's fine.

21
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:23,198
- I thought Addison left.
- She put her brother on
a plane last night.

22
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,686
Admit it, her hanging
around your guy, it bugs.

23
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:30,271
It doesn't bug. You bug.

24
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:34,676
Karev, page Addison.
Tell her I need her to stay.

25
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,179
OK, it bugs a little.

26
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:40,966
Lack of blood flow is causing
the mini-strokes and aphasia.

27
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:46,104
We can't put the surgery off any longer.
I'll do a repair called an EC-IC bypass.

28
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:49,825
And that will fix the strokes?
She'll be better after this?

29
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:53,044
- I'm hoping it will work, yes.
- But, uh...

30
00:01:55,065 --> 00:01:58,867
They wouldn't operate unless it were
safe for the baby. Dr. Montgomery?

31
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:02,888
Your blood pressure's high, but I'll
be there to monitor you and the baby.

32
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,623
Get some rest.
We'll see you soon.

33
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:09,327
- Thank you for staying.
- Least I could do for saving
Archie.

34
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,164
Um...

35
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,733
I know what we said
before about the baby,

36
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:20,005
but if something should happen, if it
comes down to a choice, save my wife.

37
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:23,408
We can make another baby.
We can't make another her.

38
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:30,665
Fifty-two-year-old
male, fell down stairs.

39
00:02:30,767 --> 00:02:34,770
Five days post-op from a cholecystectomy
which looks to have caused the fall.

40
00:02:34,872 --> 00:02:38,189
Why would having your
gallbladder removed cause a fall?

41
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,980
A non-laparoscopic cholie?

42
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,866
Sir, what hospital did you
have your operation at?

43
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:52,403
- Here. My surgeon
was Dr. Campbell.
- That explains it.

44
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,240
Excuse us for a moment.

45
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,777
All right, what?

46
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,664
Campbell was Seattle
Grace's first female surgeon.

47
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:06,418
She just sits in her office
and spreads prestige around.

48
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,254
She still does the routine
surgery now and then.

49
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,924
Botches routine
surgery. I'll page the chief.

50
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:16,227
- No, page Campbell. It's her patient.
- Let her maim the guy again?

51
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,212
Page someone who
knows how to operate,

52
00:03:18,315 --> 00:03:21,783
instead of some dinosaur
who refuses to retire her scalpel

53
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:23,985
and go join her friends in Boca.

54
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:25,887
The dinosaur is here.

55
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:31,760
No need to page me.

56
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,349
- So did you scope her out yet?
- Who?

57
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,451
- Arizona.
- Oh, right.

58
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:43,188
I haven't had a chance to swing by
Peds and ask the nurse to point out

59
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,991
the attending who kissed
my friend in a bar bathroom.

60
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:49,194
- At least you're
still good for coffee.
- That's not for you.

61
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:54,116
- Coffee. Why, thank you, Mark.
- That's not for you either.

62
00:03:54,218 --> 00:03:58,787
- Good morning, Dr. Grey.
- Keep your secret coffee.

63
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:02,691
Until you tell Derek, our
relationship continues to consist

64
00:04:02,793 --> 00:04:05,626
of you hiding in the attic and
me smuggling snacks past Mer.

65
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:08,079
- Know what that makes you?
- Your boyfriend?

66
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:11,967
Anne Frank. I'm dating
Anne Frank, and I'm tired of it.

67
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:15,420
I want to go downstairs. I wanna
tell the Germans to kiss my ass.

68
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:18,339
I'm gonna tell him. Soon.

69
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:20,208
When I do, you'll be
my date to the wedding.

70
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,644
- Derek proposed?
- Not yet. But when he does.

71
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,535
This is the first step
in the start of a new life.

72
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,937
How are we feeling?
Positive? Confident?

73
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,440
I am good. Great.

74
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,937
You take care of
your own feelings.

75
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:39,360
Peds Surgery is
super competitive.

76
00:04:39,462 --> 00:04:42,247
That's why I'm armed with
letters of recommendation

77
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:45,734
to put the competition to shame.
Shepherd says I'm talented.

78
00:04:45,836 --> 00:04:48,097
Sloan finds it an
honor to work with me...

79
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,489
- What does the chief think?
- I'm still working on that.

80
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:54,776
Chief's recommendation matters.
Everyone on the committee...

81
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:58,379
I know! You calm down.
I've got it under control.

82
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:01,950
Good. Because
speaking on behalf of me,

83
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:05,686
we couldn't be more
excited to have you. Yay.

84
00:05:07,824 --> 00:05:09,257
Chief? Just a friendly nudge.

85
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:12,060
Your recommendation is
due by the end of the day.

86
00:05:12,162 --> 00:05:13,840
- I'll remind Patricia.
- You have written it?

87
00:05:13,864 --> 00:05:16,665
You'll get your recommendation.

88
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,085
- I need more time.
- No.

89
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,887
Don't get me wrong. I am
honored that you asked me

90
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,739
over all the other residents,

91
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:29,310
but it's not easy distilling a doctor
of your stature to 500 words or less.

92
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:34,732
I chose you because you're the only one
to do this without screwing up. So don't.

93
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,736
Make sure he planes the patio...

94
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:43,608
- Plates the...
- We'll get him piano lessons. Yes.

95
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,143
Only puddle shell... uh.

96
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:48,947
Only public...

97
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:52,017
Public school so he doesn't
become a snob, I know.

98
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:54,236
But I don't have to.
You're gonna be there

99
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:57,288
to make sure I don't
turn him into a jerk.

100
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,575
We're here.

101
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,744
I love just...

102
00:06:03,847 --> 00:06:05,780
I know. You love me.

103
00:06:07,217 --> 00:06:10,501
And I love you. I'll
see you in a few.

104
00:06:13,824 --> 00:06:15,122
Thank you.

105
00:06:15,224 --> 00:06:18,292
Her blood pressure's
higher than it was yesterday.

106
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:19,772
- We can't wait.
- I know...

107
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,630
You want me to be aware.
You're a good doctor. So am I.

108
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:24,732
Let's just be good together.

109
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:26,646
Your guy and my
guy work well together.

110
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,030
My guy works well with everyone.

111
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,319
- Dr. Stevens?
- Yes.

112
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:35,443
Think we'll get to
scrub in on a surgery?

113
00:06:35,545 --> 00:06:39,181
You losers think you're capable of
holding someone's life in your hands

114
00:06:39,283 --> 00:06:43,200
when you could barely
finish the intern bowl? Really?

115
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,171
- Dr. Stevens, remember me?
- Yes.

116
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:50,625
I was here a couple of days ago,
you told me I might have cancer.

117
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:53,812
You sent me to an oncologist,
who sent me to an immunologist,

118
00:06:53,897 --> 00:06:56,964
who then sent me to some
other ologist I never heard of

119
00:06:57,067 --> 00:07:03,221
before I set foot in this deathtrap.
80 thousand dollars in tests later,

120
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:06,591
the only thing wrong
with me is that I'm anemic!

121
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,926
- Anemic?
- My lawyer seems to think

122
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,680
that someone here
mislabeled the blood.

123
00:07:11,782 --> 00:07:15,166
Switched it with someone
else's. I was told not to come here,

124
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,736
but my conscience wanted to
make sure you went through the files

125
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,639
of everybody who was
here at the clinic that day.

126
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,342
Of course we will. I'm so sorry.

127
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:27,529
Don't apologize to
me. I'm just anemic.

128
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:31,299
You apologize to
that dying person.

129
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,965
Middle cerebral artery?

130
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,821
Yes, after I connect the STA,

131
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,842
- we will close.
- Baby's having spontaneous
decels.

132
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:17,328
Mom's hypotensive. I don't
know how much they can handle.

133
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,847
MCA's bleeding a bit.
It shouldn't contribute.

134
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:22,884
Pressure's dropping. The
baby's gonna need to come out.

135
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:25,587
- Almost done. Wait.
- Not me that can't wait.

136
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:28,957
- The decels are getting
more frequent.
- A fetus can't handle

137
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:31,576
three surgeries in four days.
We have to get the baby out.

138
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:36,798
- He's too young to come out.
- Last decel lasted 30 seconds.

139
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,950
Let's go. I'm taking him out.

140
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,386
- Ten-blade.
- Leave the baby in.

141
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,542
Done. I'm done.

142
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,628
I'm done.

143
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,767
You've got a minor fracture
so you won't need surgery.

144
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,219
You should on your
feet within a few weeks.

145
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:02,340
I don't know what I was thinking.
The wound wasn't healing as fast...

146
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:05,744
Next time, you call me, John.

147
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:08,463
Dr. Yang, explain to my patient

148
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:10,982
what you feel I should
have done differently

149
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:16,371
in order to avoid this
complication. Don't be shy.

150
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:22,177
OK. Well, patients status post
minimally invasive procedures

151
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:25,779
have been shown to have
decreased post-surgical discomfort...

152
00:09:25,882 --> 00:09:29,634
In human please, Dr. Yang.

153
00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:34,656
This surgery should have
been done laparoscopically.

154
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:37,609
Dr. Hunt, perhaps you
can explain to Dr. Yang

155
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:40,228
why I chose to do
the surgery this way.

156
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,132
Although some doctors prefer
to use the new technology,

157
00:09:44,234 --> 00:09:46,484
there are others who
believe it's more risky

158
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,271
since we can't see or move
around as much during the surgery.

159
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:53,074
It's half a dozen either way.

160
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,778
Bravo, Dr. Hunt.

161
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,864
- Do you understand, John?
- Yes.

162
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,383
I have no doubt you
did the right thing by me.

163
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:07,038
Wonderful. Now, Dr. Yang,

164
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,207
please take our patient to CT.

165
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,610
Maybe you'll learn
something in the process.

166
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:18,249
While I confer with Dr. Hunt
about our course of treatment.

167
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:24,606
- I'm on a deadline.
- Sadie Harris mislabeled

168
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,509
a patient's blood sample.
The clinic's getting sued.

169
00:10:27,611 --> 00:10:30,778
- Good thing Sadie no longer
works here.
- No, it's not.

170
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:33,581
Because it isn't just her.
The interns, all of them,

171
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:37,668
they're capable of the same mistake.
They are dangerous and they are bad.

172
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,555
Don't tell me I'm overly
emotional and it isn't personal!

173
00:10:40,657 --> 00:10:44,025
Because it is personal! I've
worked so hard to teach them,

174
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:47,595
- and... and it is personal.
- Stevens.

175
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:50,098
I thought the same
thing about you every day

176
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,218
the first year you worked here.
Know what the chief told me?

177
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,303
Get out.

178
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,678
You don't get much rest,
do you, Dr. Shepherd?

179
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:12,120
- Did you hear yourself?
- Oh, my God!

180
00:11:12,222 --> 00:11:15,623
Oh, my God! I can talk!

181
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:18,692
I know! Listen to you!

182
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,581
And the baby? How's the baby?

183
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,301
The baby's stable. However,

184
00:11:26,403 --> 00:11:28,820
your new labs show
that you're pre-eclamptic.

185
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:32,657
We hoped to keep it from progressing
to this stage, but stress of surgery

186
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:37,061
- was a lot on your body.
- So do we need to be worried?

187
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:43,217
Come on! Dr. Shepherd, tell
me we're done being worried.

188
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,455
First moment of hope
they've had in a week.

189
00:11:47,557 --> 00:11:51,059
Pre-eclampsia is serious.
You're too close to this patient.

190
00:11:51,161 --> 00:11:54,461
Stop fighting me on this. We
had a victory. Focus on that.

191
00:11:54,563 --> 00:11:59,167
We give the family all the
information. That's our job.

192
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,187
- My guy won that round.
- Meredith?

193
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,540
Karev, can you go get
Jen's blood test results?

194
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,010
Give me a reason why I
shouldn't go to the chief.

195
00:12:09,112 --> 00:12:12,847
- The surgery was a success.
- He made a mistake in her
first surgery.

196
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:15,850
He caused complications.
He feels responsible.

197
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:18,085
So tell me why I
shouldn't go to the chief.

198
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:21,256
During the trial, he lost
patients. It affected him.

199
00:12:21,358 --> 00:12:25,326
For the better, I think. He
cares more, if that's possible.

200
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:29,146
You just have to trust him.

201
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,715
OK.

202
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:42,093
- Hey.
- Calliope.

203
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:45,513
- I haven't seen you around.
- Well, I've been avoiding you.

204
00:12:45,615 --> 00:12:47,448
I know, it's so weird.

205
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,267
You share a kiss with a
woman you've never seen...

206
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:54,405
This is a new adventure,
one I'm so ready to take,

207
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:58,275
for the second
time, and... Anyway.

208
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,729
Do you want to go
on a date with me?

209
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:05,266
Wait, Erica and you.
She was your first?

210
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:08,302
- Yeah.
- Oh.

211
00:13:08,405 --> 00:13:11,589
OK. So then I guess
my answer is no.

212
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:15,042
- I'm sorry.
- Wait. What?

213
00:13:15,144 --> 00:13:18,045
Uh... Um...

214
00:13:18,147 --> 00:13:22,016
You kissed me, out of
nowhere, in a bathroom.

215
00:13:22,118 --> 00:13:23,902
OK, this is what I try to avoid.

216
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:29,006
You're all exploring
and experimenting and...

217
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:33,228
Yay! This is a really
exciting time for you.

218
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,847
But I work in Peds. I spend
my entire day around newborns.

219
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,850
So I try not to in
my personal life.

220
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:43,921
Thanks for asking,
though. I'm super flattered.

221
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,823
Super.

222
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,866
- As discussed.
- Thank you.

223
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:02,172
Newborn. I'm not a newborn.

224
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,243
I'm a senior resident.
I'm a great surgeon.

225
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,512
I'm a divorcee, for God's sake.

226
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,446
I'm...

227
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:14,118
I'm, uh... looking for you to
agree with me here, Bailey.

228
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:17,472
- Bailey?
- The chief,

229
00:14:17,574 --> 00:14:19,974
he wrote me a form
letter of recommendation.

230
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:22,410
That's insane. He's
chief, you're Bailey.

231
00:14:22,512 --> 00:14:25,963
"Pleasant in the OR and
enjoyed by the nurses.

232
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:29,550
She's completed a
serviceable amount of research.

233
00:14:29,652 --> 00:14:31,897
A fine addition to any program."

234
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:34,839
Fine! He used the word "fine."

235
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:39,843
A blank page would mean more. I
pulled off a 12-person domino surgery.

236
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:43,814
I took out and put back
six of a dying girl's organs!

237
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:47,385
I am Dr. Bailey. I
am better than fine!

238
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,288
At least he didn't
call you a baby.

239
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:57,228
Just a minute more, Mr. Terzian.

240
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,831
Oh... Done tending
to Her Highness?

241
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,366
You're tough on people.

242
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:06,020
It's good to hold such high
standards, but this is medicine.

243
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:09,123
- No one's perfect.
- She's stubborn and
out of touch.

244
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:12,243
Forty years experience
means nothing?

245
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,156
Not if you don't
use them correctly.

246
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,931
She wants to be old
and keep operating? Fine.

247
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:20,351
- Just keep up with medicine.
- Cristina, this is one case.

248
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:23,537
You can't judge someone
based on one case.

249
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,785
That patient deserves
to know his doctor,

250
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:28,793
no matter whose
feelings it happens to hurt.

251
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:36,300
Laparoscopic or open, none of
us should have made that mistake.

252
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:12,586
You realize you're
charging one of our hospital's

253
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:15,273
most respected
surgeons with negligence.

254
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,641
Yes, sir.

255
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,394
Dr. Hunt, do you agree
with Dr. Yang's assessment?

256
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:23,464
- This is Dr. Yang's call.
- I'm asking you, Dr. Hunt.

257
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,300
Campbell outranks me, sir.

258
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:30,104
I think it would be best for you
to discuss it with her directly.

259
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:33,391
Very well. Page Dr. Campbell.

260
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,943
I want to speak to that
patient before surgery.

261
00:16:36,045 --> 00:16:37,961
Yes, sir.

262
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,683
Way to take a stand.

263
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:47,772
There he is, the legend himself.

264
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,674
How are you, legend?

265
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,110
Are you drunk? Should
I be worried about you?

266
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:56,814
He's got his sense of humor
back. How's your patient?

267
00:16:56,916 --> 00:17:00,117
She's good, stable. Today's
the first day in a long time

268
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,653
I remember what it feels
like to be good at my job.

269
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:06,540
You? Come on, you're like
the Dalai Lama of surgery.

270
00:17:06,642 --> 00:17:10,711
People from all over the world come to
let you cut into them. Know what else?

271
00:17:10,814 --> 00:17:13,964
You look good doing it. I
like the facial hair, by the way.

272
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:17,418
- Keep it that length. No more, no less.
- All right, stop.

273
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,237
Derek, there's something
we need to discuss.

274
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,659
- Go ahead and have sex
with Addison.
- Addison?

275
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,775
- Go for it.
- I don't want to.

276
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,678
Really? What did
you want to discuss?

277
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,135
Nothing.

278
00:17:35,037 --> 00:17:36,871
OK.

279
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,430
- How's my mother?
- Bitter.

280
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,599
Angry. Genius.

281
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:52,336
What's so wrong is how much
the chief and your mother fought.

282
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,506
- Sex must have been great.
- Saying that, that's wrong.

283
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:59,026
What's wrong? Our entire
healthcare system? I agree.

284
00:17:59,128 --> 00:18:01,345
Here it is. "March 3, 1979.

285
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:04,148
Assisted Margaret
Campbell on a splenectomy.

286
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,919
Impressive resume, adequate
technique." Hack! Even then.

287
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,089
You're working with
Margaret Campbell?

288
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:14,675
Yeah. Ye Oldy Timey thinks
she's sane enough to do surgery.

289
00:18:14,777 --> 00:18:16,172
That's what I like
about your mom.

290
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:18,507
She wasn't Alzheimer-y
and still operating.

291
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:22,316
Do me a favor and shoot me if I
start making mistakes on patients

292
00:18:22,418 --> 00:18:25,052
- and think it's kosher to cut.
- Sounds like Shepherd.

293
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:27,605
- Alex.
- Please, my guy's right.

294
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:30,191
Your guy nicked an aneurysm
and is trying to cover his ass.

295
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,394
Your guy needs to shut up.

296
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,752
- What happened?
- Bypass must have blown.

297
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:45,122
- Page Addison, meet in the OR!
- I told them everything was OK.

298
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:49,427
I don't understand. He said
the surgery was a success.

299
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:53,697
I'll give you an update
as soon as we can, OK?

300
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,301
The swelling's not going down.

301
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:00,571
Maybe the
ventriculostomy is plugged.

302
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,308
No. Damn it!

303
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:11,932
Derek?

304
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:15,502
I have to take out
the temporal lobe.

305
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,973
- Won't that kill her?
- No.

306
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:23,828
She could lose some speech,
memory and vocal pattern.

307
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:28,032
The brain can rewire. I've
done it before to stop seizures.

308
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,468
Have you done
it before for this?

309
00:19:32,855 --> 00:19:35,439
- I'm doing it now.
- Baby's got decels.

310
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,508
What are we doing here, Derek?

311
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,045
Bayonet forceps.

312
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:45,249
What are we supposed to say?
"Shepherd's cutting out parts

313
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,885
of your wife's brain.
She'll pull through?"

314
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:51,088
Tell him the truth. Dr. Shepherd
is doing everything he can

315
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,825
- to save your wife and child.
- The guy's life ended as he
knew it. Tell him that.

316
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,727
Alex, just be...

317
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,497
The baby's having
heart fluctuations,

318
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:03,784
but Dr. Montgomery is taking every
precaution to avoid an early delivery.

319
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:06,170
- And my wife?
- Dr. Shepherd is trying to get

320
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:11,258
the bleeding under control, but we won't
know more until the surgery's finished.

321
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,094
But she won't die?

322
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,982
Please tell me she won't die.

323
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:22,335
Shepherd is doing everything
to make sure your wife lives.

324
00:20:22,437 --> 00:20:24,221
She'll live?

325
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:27,208
Dr. Shepherd is doing
absolutely everything he can.

326
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,576
We should get back.

327
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:31,912
Right. Of course. Thanks.

328
00:20:32,014 --> 00:20:35,132
- Thank you.
- Your guy sucks.

329
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:44,908
Mr. Terzian, your scans show a change
from Dr. Campbell's original assessment.

330
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,460
There was a complication
from the surgery,

331
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:51,865
a lacerated bile duct and artery.
You'll need another surgery to repair it.

332
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:54,401
- Is that all?
- Yes, that's all.

333
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,537
Oh, thank God!

334
00:20:56,639 --> 00:21:00,106
I thought when they told me
the chief of surgery was coming,

335
00:21:00,209 --> 00:21:02,759
I was a goner for sure.

336
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:09,800
We wanted to make you aware that it's within
your rights to request a change of surgeon.

337
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:13,203
- Dr. Campbell's not available?
- She's available.

338
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:16,907
No, thank you. I
choose Dr. Campbell.

339
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:21,061
- Very well. Dr. Campbell.
- Richard.

340
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:28,786
Sir, with all due respect, I don't think
the patient's clear on what happened.

341
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,233
You heard the patient.
He wants his doctor.

342
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:33,691
- But sir...
- Back down, Yang.

343
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:38,546
I just need you to tell me
if it's worthy of Dr. Bailey.

344
00:21:38,648 --> 00:21:41,548
Bailey's an ass. She
doesn't listen to residents

345
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,034
when they have important
information about interns.

346
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,797
You're missing the
point of the exercise,

347
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:48,939
which is to say nice
and impressive things.

348
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,278
You still hang out here?

349
00:21:56,849 --> 00:22:00,034
Just say she's dependable.
Say she's selfless.

350
00:22:00,136 --> 00:22:03,237
Everything she was
until she wasn't. Just...

351
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:05,172
You should probably go.

352
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:09,092
Dependably selfless.

353
00:22:09,778 --> 00:22:11,895
- Thank you.
- Hm.

354
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:20,520
Isobel Stevens?

355
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:33,500
It's been years since I've
had you in my OR, chief.

356
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:37,871
I seem to remember an incident
with a clamp being dropped

357
00:22:37,973 --> 00:22:39,373
into an open body cavity.

358
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:42,092
You're never gonna let
me live that one down.

359
00:22:42,178 --> 00:22:45,763
A good teacher never lets
up on her students. Although,

360
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:49,099
I've often wondered how the
upcoming classes learn anything

361
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,601
with the way we
teach these days.

362
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:55,673
Attendings seem more concerned
with inspiring their students,

363
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:59,376
using encouragement
and validation and so forth,

364
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,713
instead of instilling them
with the fear and shame

365
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:06,066
that causes one to remember
anything in the first place.

366
00:23:06,168 --> 00:23:08,368
Dr. Hunt, you come
from the military.

367
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,322
Wouldn't you say the rigid aspects
of your training helped you become

368
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:15,142
- the doctor you are today?
- Yes. Very much so.

369
00:23:15,244 --> 00:23:18,612
Dr. Yang, on the other
hand, something tells me fear

370
00:23:18,714 --> 00:23:23,150
is not something you
have often faced in the OR.

371
00:23:23,252 --> 00:23:25,719
I'd appreciate any
opportunity to learn.

372
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:29,139
Wonderful. Let us begin then.

373
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:33,026
Tell me how you'd do a
pulmonary embolectomy.

374
00:23:33,128 --> 00:23:35,796
I'd insert a steerable
catheter into the femoral vein

375
00:23:35,898 --> 00:23:38,849
and position a fluoroscope
adjacent to the embolus.

376
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:42,903
What would you do if the
power should suddenly go out?

377
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:52,096
Or if you had to operate in a hospital
that couldn't afford a fluoroscope?

378
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:55,749
It's like a calculator. Just because
there's a machine to do it for them,

379
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:59,002
children shouldn't have
to learn simple arithmetic?

380
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,506
If it would help them
avoid mistakes like this one.

381
00:24:08,764 --> 00:24:12,315
Out of my OR!

382
00:24:13,402 --> 00:24:14,968
I said get out! Out!

383
00:24:15,804 --> 00:24:18,872
This is still my OR!

384
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:23,927
She's bleeding into the frontal
lobe. If I can stop the bleed,

385
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:27,547
save the rest of the
brain, she'll have a chance.

386
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:32,920
Decels are getting longer.

387
00:24:33,022 --> 00:24:38,092
- I have to
deliver the baby.
- No. Just...

388
00:24:38,194 --> 00:24:40,594
If you cut her, she'll
bleed out. I can save her.

389
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,229
How?

390
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:49,870
- I have to cut out
the frontal lobe.
- What?

391
00:24:49,972 --> 00:24:53,189
Derek, no. Stop. Derek.
You've done enough.

392
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,704
Can she live without
frontal and temporal?

393
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:58,311
- Yes.
- No, she can't.

394
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,280
This baby isn't
getting any oxygen.

395
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:03,684
You want to save Jen, you
feel you have to, but not this way.

396
00:25:03,786 --> 00:25:05,986
I can save them
both. She will live.

397
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:09,540
Not as the person her husband
and child need her to be.

398
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:13,293
She'll lose everything about
her that makes her human.

399
00:25:13,395 --> 00:25:16,547
- Meredith.
- Are you sure you can do this?

400
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:20,417
- I have no choice. Bipolars.
- Baby's heart is bottoming out.

401
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,238
Damn it, Derek!
This has gone too far.

402
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:28,541
Taking the frontal lobe out, even if
she lives, you're creating a monster.

403
00:25:28,644 --> 00:25:31,094
You don't get to play God here!

404
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:35,715
Jen is gone, but this baby
has a chance. Let her go.

405
00:25:35,818 --> 00:25:39,353
Let it go. Please, let...

406
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:42,755
- I'm taking the baby out.
- Put down the scalpel, Addison!

407
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:52,750
You put down the scalpel.

408
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:05,112
- Addison, put the scalpel down.
- You put it down!

409
00:26:05,214 --> 00:26:08,998
Get off the scalpel,
Addison! Take it off!

410
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,405
- Meredith...
- Do not go anywhere.

411
00:26:17,192 --> 00:26:18,992
Karev, go!

412
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:28,101
- Derek, don't do this.
- Do not touch my patient.

413
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,901
Meredith.

414
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:49,990
Derek, look at me. You
don't have to do this.

415
00:26:50,092 --> 00:26:54,261
Jen's gone. It's too late. You
can't save her. She's gone.

416
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,430
We can save the baby.

417
00:26:57,166 --> 00:27:00,184
Derek, look at me.

418
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:08,108
Certain surgeries get
the best of all of us.

419
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,544
I made a mistake.

420
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:13,513
A careless mistake.

421
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:15,860
And for that, I am sorry.

422
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,419
But I am only human,

423
00:27:18,521 --> 00:27:20,920
as human as any of us.

424
00:27:21,022 --> 00:27:26,260
And for that, I
do not apologize.

425
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:31,565
- Margaret, you don't have...
- No need to discuss it further.

426
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:33,817
No need at all.

427
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,902
- Chief, we need you in OR 1!
- Karev?

428
00:27:36,004 --> 00:27:39,323
Right now, sir!

429
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,663
I was fired. From the Army.

430
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,249
They call it an
honorable discharge,

431
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:53,303
but they knew it was my
time, even though I didn't.

432
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,457
I'm grateful to them for that.

433
00:28:14,643 --> 00:28:17,494
The baby's still in distress.
I need to take it out.

434
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:20,564
Wait. Just wait. The
bleeding could stop.

435
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:24,735
The baby could stabilize. If we
do a C-section now, she'll die.

436
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:27,370
- She is dead, Derek.
- Please, just wait.

437
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:31,608
Most of her brain is gone. For all
intents and purposes, she's dead.

438
00:28:38,451 --> 00:28:42,368
Karev, page Dr. Friedman's team.
Tell her we have a preemie on the way.

439
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,574
Stop cutting.

440
00:28:52,781 --> 00:28:55,082
Why are you cutting?

441
00:28:55,184 --> 00:28:58,568
Meredith, get some more
blood. She needs more blood.

442
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,938
Get more blood.

443
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,392
- She needs more blood.
- No more blood, Derek.

444
00:29:09,782 --> 00:29:11,882
No more blood.

445
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,689
You're smart to get it looked at, but
it doesn't look too suspicious to me.

446
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:22,175
- Even combined with
high LDH levels?
- Oh.

447
00:29:22,277 --> 00:29:27,064
That could be caused by
anything, mono, exercise even.

448
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:31,184
Coupled with neurological
episodes? Hallucinations?

449
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:36,339
There we go. All done.

450
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,175
You and I both see
patients do this everyday.

451
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,496
They find something and
convince themselves they're sick.

452
00:29:42,598 --> 00:29:45,415
But as doctors,
you and I both know

453
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:49,019
that it's our job to
remain worry-free

454
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,449
until we have proof
that says otherwise.

455
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:52,684
That's what you should do.

456
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,757
Relax. By this time tomorrow,

457
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,378
you'll be laughing at the fact
you thought anything was wrong.

458
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,298
OK. Ready?

459
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,320
He looks strong.

460
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:13,660
He definitely has a chance.
Let's get him intubated.

461
00:30:13,762 --> 00:30:16,446
Placenta.

462
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:43,824
The steroids we gave your wife
allowed your baby's lungs to mature.

463
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:48,445
That, combined with the extra
days that Dr. Shepherd took

464
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:51,898
to do the surgery, makes us
very hopeful that he'll survive.

465
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,937
I don't understand.
She just died?

466
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,826
I'm sorry.

467
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:08,865
Yeah, I know.
You said that. Um...

468
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,586
I'm asking how she died.

469
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:20,527
Your wife's high blood pressure
caused the bypass to fail.

470
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:24,430
That caused the bleeding
and swelling in the brain.

471
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:28,618
Dr. Shepherd did everything he could to save
her. There was too much damage to her brain.

472
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,340
That's when Dr. Montgomery
stepped in to deliver the baby.

473
00:31:36,445 --> 00:31:40,880
You said it was a routine
procedure, she would be fine.

474
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,450
Then there was a complication.

475
00:31:43,552 --> 00:31:45,702
And you said you fixed that.

476
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:48,972
But then the baby got sick,

477
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,375
and that made Jen sick.

478
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:55,161
But then you said
you fixed that, too.

479
00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:57,597
And now she's dead.

480
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:03,936
- I'm sorry.
- Stop saying you're sorry!

481
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:06,939
You killed her!

482
00:32:07,042 --> 00:32:11,244
You're a murderer! A murderer!

483
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,463
Where's my wife?

484
00:32:15,617 --> 00:32:17,501
I want my wife!

485
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:20,938
I want my wife!

486
00:32:23,826 --> 00:32:25,992
I want...

487
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:32,833
I want...

488
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,421
I know it's bad. But I tried.

489
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:43,026
You're just very complex,
and word-defying.

490
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,311
Chief!

491
00:32:45,414 --> 00:32:47,881
That is a letter of
recommendation!

492
00:32:47,982 --> 00:32:50,382
O'Malley? You want me to
take pointers from O'Malley?

493
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:54,738
You'd be hard-pressed to find a
better person to take pointers from.

494
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,274
- Chief? Chief!
- Exactly!

495
00:32:58,377 --> 00:33:02,812
I am the chief of surgery. I don't have
time to write letters to pump your ego.

496
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:05,248
My head of Neuro is
being called a murderer,

497
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,435
I have to fire my general
surgeon 'cause she won't retire,

498
00:33:08,537 --> 00:33:11,371
interns are mixing up
blood samples in your clinic,

499
00:33:11,473 --> 00:33:15,542
and you want me to write a
recommendation so you can leave?

500
00:33:15,644 --> 00:33:18,644
Leave you? Sir, I am

501
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,697
applying for a fellowship
in pediatric surgery.

502
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:25,518
Which is not what we discussed! Do you
know how much of my time you wasted?

503
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,921
The amount of work it
takes to groom someone?

504
00:33:28,022 --> 00:33:29,922
You were supposed
to become the next me!

505
00:33:30,024 --> 00:33:31,669
You wanted me to
become the next you.

506
00:33:31,693 --> 00:33:33,738
I am not your son
or your daughter.

507
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:36,579
You don't pin all your
hopes and dreams on me, sir!

508
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:49,359
I'm seeing Lexie.

509
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:52,812
Sleeping with her too, but it's
more than that. We're happy.

510
00:33:52,914 --> 00:33:54,514
I'm happy.

511
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:03,539
OK, that's... Maybe
I deserved that.

512
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:04,924
You know what? I didn't.

513
00:34:05,026 --> 00:34:07,794
You have no right to tell
me who I can sleep with.

514
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,623
You're worried
about your legacy.

515
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:44,213
But I am not your legacy!

516
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:48,818
And me applying to...
You are not listening to me.

517
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,019
What the...?

518
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,355
Oh, my goodness!

519
00:34:53,608 --> 00:34:57,194
Come on. Come on!
Come on, stop. Come on!

520
00:34:57,296 --> 00:35:00,080
Come on.

521
00:35:01,215 --> 00:35:04,484
It's done.

522
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,556
That's her guy.

523
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:32,062
I'd do a pulmonary arteriotomy,

524
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:36,233
directly visualize the clot
and use forceps to extract it.

525
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:40,069
That's how I'd do a pulmonary
embolectomy without a fluoroscope.

526
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:43,406
The fact that you felt the
need to come tell me that

527
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:47,694
tells me you're a much better
surgeon than I first thought.

528
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:53,733
I've decided today's
surgery was my last.

529
00:35:53,835 --> 00:35:57,304
You look at me like you won't wake
up one day not that far from now,

530
00:35:57,406 --> 00:36:01,174
so much faster than
you can imagine,

531
00:36:01,276 --> 00:36:03,726
and find that you are me.

532
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:07,497
When you can't cut anymore,

533
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,849
what will you have?

534
00:36:09,951 --> 00:36:12,819
I was a god.

535
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:16,923
In this OR. Holding a scalpel.

536
00:36:17,025 --> 00:36:18,892
I was a god.

537
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:21,895
And now...

538
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,469
What will you have?

539
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,471
I don't see anyone
burning the place down.

540
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:49,939
That's how they do it.

541
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,143
Do everything right. As soon as
you look away, they screw it up.

542
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:56,812
Hey, I'm sorry. I
was busy earlier.

543
00:36:56,915 --> 00:37:00,166
With myself, I was
busy, so I'm sorry.

544
00:37:00,268 --> 00:37:01,968
Don't be.

545
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:05,355
I called you an ass.
And you were right.

546
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:08,541
I think I just needed to vent.

547
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,354
I'm sick of this place.

548
00:37:10,378 --> 00:37:12,044
Hell, I just watched
Derek Shepherd

549
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:15,965
beat up a man because he's
sick of it. That's the way it works.

550
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:21,237
The patients we lose, the mistakes
we make, that's how we learn.

551
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:22,889
It's the only way
it's ever been done.

552
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:27,042
Figure out a better way, and
you will be a better doctor than us.

553
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:30,530
<i>Patients see us as gods.</i>

554
00:37:35,436 --> 00:37:38,554
- Izzie?
- <i>Or they see us as monsters.</i>

555
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:42,876
<i>But the fact is,
we're just people.</i>

556
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:46,496
Hi.

557
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:49,015
OK, well, it's not broken.

558
00:37:49,117 --> 00:37:53,853
But you should ice it. Lots
and lots of ice. Goodbye.

559
00:37:55,707 --> 00:38:00,777
- I'm so sorry.
- It was worth it.

560
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:03,546
No. It wasn't.

561
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:06,266
Maybe a little.

562
00:38:07,569 --> 00:38:09,468
Thank you.

563
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,237
<i>We screw up.</i>

564
00:38:13,842 --> 00:38:16,392
<i>We lose our way.</i>

565
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:27,437
- I have experience to give.
- Calliope?

566
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:30,640
Life experience. Like I was
married. Did you know that?

567
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:34,844
Or that I was in the
Peace Corps. Botswana.

568
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:36,729
It convinced me to
go to med school.

569
00:38:36,831 --> 00:38:39,599
And I've experienced
the joy of cooking.

570
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:44,169
I make an excellent chicken piccata, in
addition to many other delicious meals

571
00:38:44,272 --> 00:38:47,056
you'd be lucky to experience.
That you can't open your eyes

572
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,843
to see that makes you
a little inexperienced.

573
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:57,416
- Um... Calliope, this is Julie.
- Hi.

574
00:38:57,518 --> 00:39:00,120
My date.

575
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:07,844
<i>Even the best of
us have our off days.</i>

576
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:18,571
Letter of recommendation. Callie
told me about the chief's letter.

577
00:39:18,673 --> 00:39:22,942
I figured it was the least I can
do before getting back to LA.

578
00:39:23,044 --> 00:39:28,398
- Addison Montgomery, thank you!
- Don't thank me. Just kick ass.

579
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,752
Don't make me regret writing that you
are the most promising young Peds surgeon

580
00:39:32,854 --> 00:39:35,721
I've ever had the
pleasure of working with.

581
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,027
<i>Still, we move forward.</i>

582
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:48,600
Today, you were a teacher to
someone who needed to learn,

583
00:39:48,703 --> 00:39:52,789
but you were also a bully to someone
who needed compassion. You were both.

584
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:56,125
I wasn't a bully.

585
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,179
And... I was right.

586
00:39:59,281 --> 00:40:01,280
Right.

587
00:40:01,382 --> 00:40:05,434
You're a lot like her.
Stubborn, opinionated, smart.

588
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:10,005
Forty years from now I'll have to
pry that scalpel out of your hand, too.

589
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:12,158
From my cold dead hands.

590
00:40:13,395 --> 00:40:15,461
You're missing the point.

591
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,300
I wanna be around
40 years from now.

592
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:45,241
<i>We don't rest on our laurels or
celebrate lives we've saved in the past.</i>

593
00:41:05,312 --> 00:41:08,931
<i>Because there's always some
other patient that needs help.</i>

594
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:27,917
<i>So we force ourselves to
keep trying, to keep learning.</i>

595
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:32,755
You're unmotivated,
careless, selfish, distracted,

596
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:36,942
and pretty much the people in this
hospital I'd least trust with my life.

597
00:41:37,044 --> 00:41:41,914
But that's the way it's supposed
to be. You're interns. You're babies.

598
00:41:42,016 --> 00:41:43,265
And you're lucky to work here.

599
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:46,002
We're all lucky because
we get to save lives.

600
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:51,307
Every day, we get to save
lives. That's our job, and...

601
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:55,411
It's not something a lot
of people get to do, so...

602
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:57,613
<i>- In the hope that...</i>
<i>- </i> Let's begin.

603
00:41:57,716 --> 00:41:59,159
<i>- Maybe...</i>
- New game.

604
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:02,051
<i>- Someday...</i>
- This is Patient X.

605
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:05,722
She's a 29-year-old female
we misdiagnosed with anemia

606
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:08,991
the first time she came to us.

607
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:11,122
Let's not make the
same mistake again.

608
00:42:11,146 --> 00:42:17,099
<i>We'll come just a little bit closer to
the gods our patients need us to be.</i>
