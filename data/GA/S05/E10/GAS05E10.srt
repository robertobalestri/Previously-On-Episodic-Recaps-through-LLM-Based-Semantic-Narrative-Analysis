1
00:00:10,994 --> 00:00:12,689
<i>My mother called it the greatest</i>

2
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:15,347
<i>and most terrifying
moment in her life.</i>

3
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:23,521
He said Karev.

4
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,424
<i>Standing at the head
of the surgical table,</i>

5
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:30,078
<i>knowing that the patient's life
depends on you and you alone.</i>

6
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,691
- He said Karev!
- Yes!

7
00:00:31,715 --> 00:00:33,899
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

8
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:36,335
You're "sure" sure?

9
00:00:39,356 --> 00:00:41,073
Huh.

10
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,626
<i>It's what we all dream about.</i>

11
00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:53,318
<i>Because the first person
that gets to fly solo in the OR?</i>

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,570
<i>Kind of a badass.</i>

13
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,095
- Stevens! He said Stevens!
- Which is it, moron?

14
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,447
- Stevens or Karev?
- This is stupid.

15
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,317
Trust imbeciles to tell you
who's getting solo surgery?

16
00:01:08,418 --> 00:01:11,303
Is this hard for you, being
banned from the solo surgery?

17
00:01:11,388 --> 00:01:15,274
- It must be
really hard for you.
- A mean streak. I like it.

18
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:18,310
He may change his mind.
He's been known to change.

19
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:22,046
Don't do that. Go ahead and
will yourselves to be voted in.

20
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,650
- Use the Secret.
- Grey!

21
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,235
The Chief said Grey.

22
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:30,672
- What?! This is bogus.
- You just figuring that out?

23
00:01:30,774 --> 00:01:34,676
Steve is not a lip reader. None
of the interns are lip readers.

24
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:39,531
You have to wait for the attendings
to vote, just like we did when I won.

25
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:43,335
- You won your solo surgery?
- I'm gonna pretend you didn't

26
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:47,355
feel the need to ask me that,
Yang. Of course I won. I was good.

27
00:01:47,457 --> 00:01:52,260
I didn't cut LVAD wires or put
my hand in bomb-y body cavities

28
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:56,715
or have my interns operating
on themselves. I was special.

29
00:01:56,817 --> 00:02:00,501
I was young, gifted and
black, and everybody knew it.

30
00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:02,804
The attendings knew
it, the Chief knew it.

31
00:02:02,906 --> 00:02:05,874
I didn't have to act
like I could read lips.

32
00:02:05,976 --> 00:02:09,661
Just go about my work calmly,

33
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:12,531
waiting for my
name to get called.

34
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15,083
It's done!

35
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:18,136
- Whatever, Helen Keller.
- No, I'm serious.

36
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,672
The Chief sent me.
They made their choice.

37
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:22,341
Who is it?

38
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,583
It's you.

39
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:42,978
I am happy to announce that the
first solo surgery will take place tonight.

40
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,731
A below-the-knee
amputation, bone cancer...

41
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,600
- Poor bastard.
- No appy?

42
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:52,420
- Saw action, sweet.
- Choosing who gets
first solo surgery

43
00:02:52,522 --> 00:02:55,307
isn't just about who has
the best surgical skills

44
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,993
or who's logged the
most hours in the OR.

45
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:01,045
It's about the
highest form of trust.

46
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:04,999
The trust to put a patient's life
into one of our resident's hands.

47
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,302
And for the first
time that I can recall,

48
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:11,022
every single attending
picked the same person:

49
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,141
Dr. Yang.

50
00:03:13,243 --> 00:03:17,696
However, Dr. Yang is out of the running.
She is going to pick the winner instead.

51
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:21,249
Dr. Yang will post her decision
on the OR board at 4:00pm.

52
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:25,603
Also, since your interns
are still banned from the OR,

53
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:30,242
the winner will pick a fellow resident
to scrub in with them. Good luck.

54
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,962
This is torture for me.

55
00:03:34,064 --> 00:03:36,698
I'm not even done.

56
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,983
- Sir?
- Dr. Dixon is back.

57
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:43,204
You'll be spending the day
with her. You will impress her.

58
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,991
You will make sure this
hospital impresses her.

59
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:49,461
By end of the day, I want that
woman to be my next head of Cardio.

60
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:53,148
If she's not, I'll know
who to blame. Good luck.

61
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,268
We held a retractor
for 12 hours together.

62
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,604
You said I had small hands.
Good for surgery. Remember?

63
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,073
No. Go away.

64
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,041
I operated on a
heart in an elevator.

65
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:04,921
Over a year ago. O'Malley's 007.

66
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:08,246
Think how poor your decision
would look if you gave it to him.

67
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,588
Your turn.

68
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:12,050
I don't know why you
are even bothering.

69
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:14,786
- We know who she's gonna pick.
- She's not gonna pick me

70
00:04:14,872 --> 00:04:18,539
because I'm her best friend.
She'll pick me because I'm the best.

71
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:21,359
Stop! Are you guys kidding me?

72
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,031
Fine. I'll think about it.

73
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:29,867
Just... go and
do surgical things.

74
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:33,871
Are you coming? We gotta
go do clinic. Flu season fun.

75
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,690
Yeah.

76
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:39,227
I... will catch up with you.

77
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:41,013
- Me, too.
- Shut up.

78
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:45,366
Not you.

79
00:04:45,468 --> 00:04:48,202
My head. Shut up!

80
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:54,642
When I win, you
can scrub in for me.

81
00:04:54,745 --> 00:04:57,345
Alex, she's not...
not gonna pick you.

82
00:04:57,447 --> 00:05:01,683
I'll scrub in for you, too, if you
win, which you won't. 'Cause I will.

83
00:05:01,785 --> 00:05:06,538
- Enough!
- I... I gotta go.

84
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,912
Cristina still hasn't talked to me.
Which is normal. Except it's worse.

85
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:17,248
Two weeks suspension and
she hasn't said one mean thing.

86
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,619
Karev called me a
moron. Which is good.

87
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:24,122
- Residents don't look at me.
- Least they could do
is hate us.

88
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,274
I'm gonna get some sex.

89
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:29,578
- Sex always
makes me feel better.
- Don't look at me.

90
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:33,381
- Me, neither.
- That makes three of us.

91
00:05:39,556 --> 00:05:40,939
Hi.

92
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,490
I get it.

93
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,844
I organized a crazy cabal
of secret cutter interns.

94
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:48,513
The thing is, I've been
advised to seek out sex

95
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:54,268
as a way out of my sad predicament,
but I'd rather just learn today, so...

96
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,455
what do you say? You, me...

97
00:05:57,558 --> 00:06:00,976
Why are you talking about sex?
Inappropriate. I'm your teacher.

98
00:06:01,078 --> 00:06:04,295
I have things to teach.
Double board-certified things.

99
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:07,849
That's... That's what I was
talking about. For you to teach me.

100
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,752
Medicine. The sex...
That was a joke.

101
00:06:10,854 --> 00:06:16,040
Dr. Sloan, I heard you're performing
a hypopharynx reconstruction today.

102
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,359
- I'm gonna make a woman speak.
- Let's hope.

103
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,680
- I read up on the surgery...
- You read up on my surgery?

104
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:25,884
Since it's your first time performing
what is a cutting-edge surgery,

105
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,503
I was hoping you might
need an extra set of hands.

106
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:30,533
Fine. You can join
Dr. Grey and me.

107
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,058
Dr. Grey who is
banned from the OR?

108
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,693
She's on cappuccino duty.

109
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:39,347
- Which I'm still waiting for.
- Right away. Thank you.

110
00:06:43,052 --> 00:06:46,238
Dr. Virginia Dixon. It says she
arrived over half an hour ago!

111
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,290
- Where is she?
- Nervous?

112
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:52,077
What are you doing here? This is
cardio wing. Only cardio gods allowed.

113
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:56,081
I know. I'm looking around, getting
to know other parts of the hospital.

114
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,734
What else is there? The OR,
the ER and the place with the food.

115
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:02,854
Somebody's got a lot to learn.

116
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:06,390
Kathleen Patterson. Laryngectomy
five years ago resulted in loss

117
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:09,594
of her ability to speak.
Undergone surgical attempts

118
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,881
to restore her voice in the
past. None have been successful.

119
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:16,635
This time, though, this time we
have a good feeling about this.

120
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,587
Right, honey?

121
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:25,644
As discussed, I'll get blood supply
from your arm, cartilage from...

122
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,845
from your...

123
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,564
Kathleen?

124
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,249
Honey?

125
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:34,569
Honey.

126
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,122
You can talk to me.

127
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:40,241
I'll get skin and blood from
her arm, cartilage from her nose

128
00:07:40,343 --> 00:07:43,978
to construct a speaking tube
which will become her new voicebox.

129
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,132
You should be aware there's a
chance the procedure might not work.

130
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:51,052
- He's clear on that.
- I'm just reminding him

131
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:53,404
not to get his hopes up.

132
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,923
Any other questions
I can answer?

133
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:01,730
Kathleen? Honey?

134
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:06,529
Tell me everything
to know about Karev.

135
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,320
- Why?
- I'm his intern.

136
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:10,333
He seems cool
enough at your house.

137
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:13,958
Whatever he's got going with the
girl who masturbates all the time...

138
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,460
I don't like to judge.

139
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:18,330
Still, officially, I'm his
intern, so what's his deal?

140
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:22,500
Sadie, I can't be your friend in
here. I'm a resident, you're an intern.

141
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:26,638
You have to figure out how not
to piss off Alex Karev yourself.

142
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,406
- OK. I get it.
- Good.

143
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,343
And ugly! It wasn't my fault!

144
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:33,478
I had to tell those
guys where to meet us!

145
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,481
I said I'd do it that way
you could drive! I'm telling!

146
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,666
- I'll kill you!
- You need to calm down.

147
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,413
- Tell her!
- Shut up!

148
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,238
- What happened?
- Sisters, 16 and 15,
crashed dad's car.

149
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:46,875
All we know since they won't stop
screaming. We need your names.

150
00:08:46,977 --> 00:08:50,544
- Don't tell her. Don't say a word.
- Her name is Holly Anderson.

151
00:08:50,646 --> 00:08:53,631
She was driving. And
texting. While driving!

152
00:08:53,716 --> 00:08:56,034
Is there an officer? I
want to press charges.

153
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:59,037
- You suck-up! Suck-up assface!
- We need your number

154
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:02,824
- so we can call your parents.
- Here. I speed-dialed my dad.

155
00:09:02,926 --> 00:09:04,942
- You are such a bitch!
- No, you are!

156
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,912
- Make it stop.
- Shut up!

157
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,421
You are dead when Mom and Dad
show up. The doctors will save you again.

158
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,706
- I hate you!
- I hate you more!

159
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,175
- I hate you both.
- All the time!

160
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:23,978
- So easy, OK?
- Come on!

161
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:37,792
I know you still see me as
007, but that was day one.

162
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:40,561
I've grown a lot since
then, and learned a lot.

163
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:44,332
Anyone can have brains,
or anyone can have talent,

164
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:45,967
but the key is to grow.

165
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:49,955
So, sure, I had a rough start and I
had to re-do some of my intern year,

166
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:53,524
but I came out the other side,

167
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:55,543
smarter, better.

168
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:58,646
The important point
is I never gave up.

169
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:01,415
Because I'm a fighter.

170
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:08,589
Thank you.

171
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:20,217
I have to check your X-rays,
I think your leg is broken.

172
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:24,105
- You'll be off it for a while.
- No. No!

173
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:27,975
I can't miss my Future Leaders
of America conference! Holly!

174
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:30,561
Emma, I'm gonna be
grounded till graduation.

175
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:34,282
I was going to D.C.! I've
been waiting for this for a year!

176
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,401
Mom and Dad spent two grand,
they've now wasted two grand!

177
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:40,872
- You stupid baby!
- I'm separating you two.

178
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,927
Listen, I've been here. Lots.

179
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:48,963
Your dad won't be pissed.
He'll be happy you're safe.

180
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,399
He'll kill me. He'll
take away everything.

181
00:10:51,501 --> 00:10:54,385
How long have her
eyes been like that?

182
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,207
- Her eyes?
- Page Shepherd.

183
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:59,273
She might have a basilar skull
fracture. Get her up to CT now!

184
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,108
- I didn't see...
- Do scut.

185
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,844
I'll call you when she
needs another pep talk.

186
00:11:03,946 --> 00:11:06,447
- Where's she going?
- Just to run a few tests.

187
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:09,350
Good, get her out of
here. Take her away!

188
00:11:09,452 --> 00:11:11,519
I hope you die!

189
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,582
- Oh, crap.
- Somebody's in big trouble.

190
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:28,136
- Did you forget
to open it or staff it?
- Both.

191
00:11:28,238 --> 00:11:31,790
I'm sorry, everybody. I'll
be right back with the keys.

192
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:34,025
Might want to get
nurses while you're at it.

193
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:37,862
This happen a lot? If it does,
you're giving my clinic a bad name.

194
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:41,282
You're mocking me
now? Sweet, very sweet.

195
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:50,792
Dr. Dixon, there
you are. I'm Dr. Yang.

196
00:11:50,894 --> 00:11:55,696
We... I've been assigned to work
with you today. I was in the cardio lab.

197
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,217
- Sorry it took me so long.
- There's a blank spot
on this board.

198
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:02,987
There's a surgery but no
surgeon. I would like to do a surgery,

199
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:08,709
but that's an amputation and I haven't
done an amputation since residency.

200
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:14,249
Well...

201
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:18,035
that's... really
hard to... That...

202
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:20,705
Is your stuttering
pathological and persistent

203
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:23,367
or is it occasional
and stress-related?

204
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:27,312
- I don't stutter.
- I had pathological stuttering

205
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:32,316
as a child, but it can be treated
with rigorous speech therapy.

206
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,252
Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

207
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,656
Why is this slot
on the board blank?

208
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,894
I need to select one of my
fellow residents for that slot.

209
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,895
It's the first solo
surgery of my class.

210
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:48,199
The Chief asked you to
choose from your peers?

211
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,301
Yes, ma'am.

212
00:12:58,328 --> 00:13:01,562
Mr. Patterson, I have some
forms for your wife to fill out.

213
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:05,316
- Is now a good time?
- She's a blogger.

214
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:08,302
About cancer and voicelessness.

215
00:13:08,404 --> 00:13:11,605
She's famous in
certain Internet circles.

216
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,341
It seems like you two have
a great system going here.

217
00:13:14,444 --> 00:13:18,979
- You've learned to communicate.
- You mean the Post-its?

218
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:22,483
You think that's a
pretty great system?

219
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:24,435
I... it's...

220
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:28,623
- convenient?
- Yes. No. Hello. I love you.

221
00:13:30,193 --> 00:13:34,212
You read the words long enough,
they begin to lose their meaning.

222
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,501
Mid-shaft transverse tibia
fracture? Hi. Sorry to barge in.

223
00:13:40,604 --> 00:13:43,938
I was just walking by,
and I saw broken bones.

224
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,923
I love broken bones.

225
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,193
Less than five degrees
of angulation, right?

226
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,978
Yeah, it...

227
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,649
We can treat it with closed
reduction and casting.

228
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:59,787
Flexion/extension views
of the cervical spine?

229
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,874
Yes.

230
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,293
I should go see my patient.

231
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:09,130
Chair.

232
00:14:12,568 --> 00:14:15,987
She's got a hemopericardium.
Let Cardio know.

233
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:20,341
- Hey. I've got a Future Leader
outside, she needs a CT.
- Hey.

234
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,962
I'm not mad for not voting for me.
It would look like playing favorites.

235
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:26,096
You deserve it. Cristina knows,

236
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,433
- even if you two are fighting.
- You and Yang are fighting?

237
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,552
We're not fighting.
Fought. Past tense.

238
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:33,587
How bad is it? Real bad?

239
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,540
She's crashing.

240
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:40,978
<i>Code blue, fourth floor.
Code blue, fourth floor.</i>

241
00:14:42,365 --> 00:14:45,250
Brain matter in her blood.
Let OR know we're coming.

242
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:49,254
What happened
to her? Holly? Holly!

243
00:14:51,508 --> 00:14:54,358
Holly! What did
you do to my sister?

244
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,729
Holly! Holly! What
did you do to her?

245
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:09,607
Hey. So you know I deserve this.

246
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,027
You know I'm the most qualified.

247
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,830
But I don't want it to
be a big awkward thing.

248
00:15:15,932 --> 00:15:20,300
I don't. So, just, you
do what you have to do.

249
00:15:20,403 --> 00:15:23,020
OK.

250
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,323
OK.

251
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,790
I'll see you later.

252
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,496
Almost done here, Emma.

253
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,582
Holly will be all right, right?

254
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,501
- She's gonna be OK?
- She got into surgery quick.

255
00:15:37,587 --> 00:15:39,520
- That's good.
- Are my parents here?

256
00:15:39,622 --> 00:15:42,873
- They're coming. Your dad...
- Holly's gonna be all right?

257
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:46,710
She's not in, like...
She won't die?

258
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:50,064
- Emma, you didn't mean it.
- I said, "I hope you die."

259
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:53,501
That can't be the last thing
she heard me say. It can't.

260
00:15:53,602 --> 00:15:56,620
Just don't let her die. Please.

261
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,793
All right, I'll go to the OR
and get an update for you. OK?

262
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,245
OK.

263
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:10,735
Be objective, Dr. Yang.

264
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:15,372
Consider accomplishments,
achievements, look for the stand-outs.

265
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,176
Let's see what kind of stand-out
Karev proves himself to be

266
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:21,846
- when I ask him
to sew the graft.
- Really?

267
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:26,317
Absolutely. Dr. Yang, watch
Karev to see if his skills are up to par

268
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:29,070
- for the solo.
- A system! Devise a system.

269
00:16:29,171 --> 00:16:31,605
Rank everyone
accordingly. That's all.

270
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:34,024
Thank you.

271
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:38,846
- Out of the way.
- What happened?

272
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,414
Her brain's changing color.

273
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,111
She's hemorrhaging.
100 of mannitol.

274
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:44,735
What did I do? What did I do?

275
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,173
OK, OK. So the new
intern, Meredith's friend?

276
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,709
- Psycho with no appendix?
- Yeah. We talked.

277
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,879
She came to talk to me. But it
was more than that, you know?

278
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:58,466
A guy looks at you a certain way,
eyes wander when he talks to you.

279
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:01,252
Bam, you know. This
girl thing, it's confusing.

280
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,854
- Was there touching?
- No.

281
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:05,089
- Was there playing
with the hair?
- No.

282
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,292
- Was there licking of the lips?
- Oh, my God.

283
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:12,279
I made it up because I'm lonely
and depressed and desperate

284
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:14,259
for attention from
the hot new intern.

285
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,617
- Crazy new intern.
- Crazy hot.

286
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:20,037
No. The hot ones are the
ones that cause trouble,

287
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:23,190
ones that distract you from
realizing your true potential.

288
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,844
You need to focus on the medicine.
Take that pent up sexual energy

289
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:29,563
you waste thinking
about hot, naked interns

290
00:17:29,665 --> 00:17:33,684
and put it back into your
genius, your godliness.

291
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:37,138
Build someone an
organ. That's hot.

292
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,340
She smiled. Did I
mention she smiled?

293
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:40,708
No hot interns!

294
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:47,298
Then we'll insert the newly
constructed tube in between her trachea

295
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,684
and esophagus just... like...

296
00:17:50,786 --> 00:17:51,835
that.

297
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,838
So this valve flips
open when she has air...

298
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,292
You're in my space! Back
up! Just back the hell up!

299
00:17:58,394 --> 00:18:01,345
Dr. Bailey, will you please
find Dr. Grey something to do

300
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,598
- other than interfere?
- Dr. Grey?

301
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,084
Finish prepping Mrs.
Patterson for surgery.

302
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:13,791
She was in my space.

303
00:18:15,978 --> 00:18:17,978
George, can you
cover for me for a while?

304
00:18:18,047 --> 00:18:21,365
- We're swamped.
- There's something
I need to do.

305
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:24,635
- It's pressing.
- She doesn't want
to miss hot sex.

306
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:27,171
- Izzie!
- It's the clinic.

307
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:29,340
You can handle the clinic.

308
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:34,011
You're lucky she even showed
up. She hasn't been here all week.

309
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:38,031
- Dr. Shepherd...
- It wasn't you.

310
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:42,035
She had a carotid dissection.
Nothing we could have done.

311
00:18:42,137 --> 00:18:44,138
- So we can't...
- She had a massive CVA.

312
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,224
Blood to her brain was cut
off and cannot be restored.

313
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:50,911
So even though Dr. Shepherd
was able to fix the hole

314
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:53,698
in her brain that allowed
tissue to leak through her nose,

315
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,986
the subsequent carotid dissection
has caused loss of her cerebral function.

316
00:18:59,088 --> 00:19:02,123
- You do understand that?
- She's brain dead. I get it.

317
00:19:07,497 --> 00:19:10,381
She's only 16.

318
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,488
That's good news. She'll be an
excellent candidate for organ donation.

319
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,309
Excellent candidate.
Excellent organs. Young.

320
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,889
Dude.

321
00:19:35,991 --> 00:19:38,709
You were robbed. You
got screwed by politics.

322
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:42,079
The Chief, he needed a
scapegoat. It's so unfair.

323
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:47,552
I'm sorry. I can't do this. I
can kiss ass when I have to.

324
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:49,503
But not yours.

325
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,957
Below-knee amputation:
incision at mid shaft of the tibia.

326
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,692
Elevate the periosteum
and cut the tibia with saw.

327
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:58,195
Ligate bundles and
release tourniquet.

328
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:01,765
I've done four: one on a
cadaver, three on Stan.

329
00:20:05,054 --> 00:20:08,873
- Know who you're gonna pick?
- I'm ranking them.

330
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:12,326
According to a system.
Surgical skills, hours in the OR,

331
00:20:12,428 --> 00:20:15,112
published papers,
academic accomplishments.

332
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:18,115
You know them, their
capabilities. Go with your gut.

333
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:22,235
My gut? I'm not putting a patient's
life in the hands of a novice surgeon

334
00:20:22,338 --> 00:20:25,422
- based on my gut.
- Well, it worked for me.

335
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:26,907
Your gut?

336
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:30,544
It's what told me to choose you.

337
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,785
- Hey.
- Hey.

338
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,954
- Beautiful.
- What?

339
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:46,861
- Your necklace.
- Oh, right. Um...

340
00:20:49,065 --> 00:20:52,215
- I have to go.
- See ya.

341
00:20:56,806 --> 00:20:59,573
I hope you didn't page me
to help pass out cough drops.

342
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,555
- Ain't gonna happen.
- Where's Izzie?

343
00:21:01,644 --> 00:21:04,728
- I thought she was here.
- She's avoiding me.

344
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,648
- What do you want me to do?
- You are together now?

345
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,135
Talk to her. Find out why she
couldn't care about her clinic.

346
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:13,888
You're pissed 'cause
you can't handle the flu.

347
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,158
Something's wrong, Alex.
You need to talk to her.

348
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,395
- She won't talk to me.
- Don't talk to me
about Izzie again.

349
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:27,884
It's just George.

350
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,821
Your friends, they're out
there fighting for a chance

351
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:34,374
to chop of that guy's
leg. What is that, anyway?

352
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:37,828
It's how we learn. By doing.

353
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,764
I lost my shot at the solo
surgery as soon as the Chief

354
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,083
made it Cristina's decision.

355
00:21:44,854 --> 00:21:47,354
Anyway, there'll
always be surgeries.

356
00:21:47,456 --> 00:21:50,507
There won't always be fiancés
who come back from the dead.

357
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,576
Good point.

358
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,600
Aren't you going to
deepithelialize here

359
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:03,220
to connect it to the trachea?

360
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,423
You're a very eager
student, Dr. Bailey.

361
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:09,944
- Very thorough.
- Any way I can be of service.

362
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:21,238
- I'm not sorry.
- What?

363
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,908
For what we did. It was
extreme. Maybe even stupid.

364
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,544
But this program, you
should be down in that OR,

365
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:30,881
not up here in the nosebleeds.
I shouldn't be spending my day

366
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:33,784
transcribing Karev's
illegible handwriting.

367
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:38,689
How is that teaching? They call me crazy
Sadie and God knows what other names,

368
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:41,592
but that doesn't change
that this program is broken.

369
00:22:41,677 --> 00:22:45,962
The only time they bother with us
is if they think they can get us in bed.

370
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:48,966
That's not true. Dr. Sloan
took the time to teach me,

371
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,652
- and that wasn't about sex.
- He likes you.

372
00:22:51,754 --> 00:22:53,654
Who? Dr. Sloan?

373
00:22:53,756 --> 00:22:56,590
Don't tell me you haven't
noticed his eyes on your ass.

374
00:22:56,692 --> 00:23:01,094
- You are delusional.
- Is he cutting into her throat?

375
00:23:02,097 --> 00:23:04,031
Bloody hell.

376
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:11,122
So I suppose
you'll use a strip test

377
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:13,791
to confirm flow across
the anastomosis?

378
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,860
It can damage the endothelium.

379
00:23:15,962 --> 00:23:19,129
- But don't you need to...
- Dr. Bailey,

380
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,282
would you rather do
Patterson's surgery? I can leave.

381
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:27,254
Dr. Sloan, I wasn't...
questioning your surgical skills.

382
00:23:27,356 --> 00:23:32,092
I was just trying to learn.
Something exciting. Something new.

383
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:37,514
Residents are fighting tooth and
nail for a chance to cut off a leg.

384
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:41,185
What you've done here, you made
something where there was nothing.

385
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:44,571
And... it's thrilling.

386
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,275
I was just trying to learn.

387
00:23:49,979 --> 00:23:53,363
Thank you, Dr. Bailey.

388
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:57,885
Would you take the flap veins
and join them to the internal jugular?

389
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:09,063
<i>♪ The spartan mule
and the crippled cow ♪</i>

390
00:24:09,165 --> 00:24:12,649
She looks like she's
sleeping. Can I touch her?

391
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,369
Yes, of course.

392
00:24:20,242 --> 00:24:21,625
Can she hear me?

393
00:24:23,412 --> 00:24:27,331
She can come out
of it, right? The coma?

394
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:29,900
- People can do that?
- No, she can't.

395
00:24:29,985 --> 00:24:34,120
I'm very sorry for your loss. But
tests confirm that, although your sister's

396
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,740
bodily functions are
fine, her brain is dead.

397
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:39,960
She has no thoughts,
no emotions, no senses.

398
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:44,781
I'm Dr. Dixon. I will be
harvesting your sister's organs

399
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:48,369
- if your parents agree.
- Please, she's our baby.

400
00:24:48,471 --> 00:24:50,587
- We need time.
- I'm sorry for your loss.

401
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:54,925
But her organs are young and
vital. They could save many lives.

402
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:57,244
Wake up, Holly.

403
00:24:57,346 --> 00:25:00,046
Wake up, come on, wake up.

404
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:03,934
I'm very sorry for your loss,
but your sister can't wake up.

405
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:06,853
Her basic functions are
gone. Her brain is dead.

406
00:25:06,955 --> 00:25:11,492
Her body is alive but, unfortunately,
unfortunately, she is dead.

407
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:14,077
Get out! You cannot have her.

408
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,831
- And you cannot take her.
- Dr. Dixon, I think,

409
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,216
I think they understand.

410
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,220
I think you should go now.

411
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:29,476
I have offended you, but
we are running out of time.

412
00:25:29,578 --> 00:25:31,127
Get out!

413
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:35,298
Holly, wake up!

414
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:38,352
Wake up, Holly!

415
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,303
Holly, wake up!

416
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:42,322
Holly, wake up, please!

417
00:25:59,408 --> 00:26:03,910
Have you ever had mind-blowing sex?
The kind of sex that makes you want to die?

418
00:26:04,013 --> 00:26:07,714
Just fall on the floor
and give up and die?

419
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:11,085
'Cause this sex I'm
having, it's that good.

420
00:26:11,187 --> 00:26:15,305
It's the best sex I've ever had. It's
the best sex anybody's ever had.

421
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:19,759
I don't know why anybody who's had
this sex would do anything but have sex.

422
00:26:19,861 --> 00:26:21,294
Izzie...

423
00:26:21,396 --> 00:26:25,382
You're gonna give the solo surgery
to Mer, which is typical and boring

424
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:29,086
and slightly corrupt, but at
least I'm having really, really,

425
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:32,222
really good sex.

426
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,743
Just thought you should know.

427
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:45,452
I know you're nervous. It
may feel strange at first,

428
00:26:45,554 --> 00:26:48,738
- but just give it a shot.
- You haven't forgotten.

429
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:51,024
You can do it.

430
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:58,715
No! No! No more!

431
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,518
No more typing!
No more Post-its!

432
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,120
No!

433
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,689
Talk to me. Talk to me, damn it!

434
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,191
Talk to me!

435
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:14,164
Maybe we should
give her a little time.

436
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:21,838
Maybe you should go, too.
Just go for a walk or a drive.

437
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,844
- Just give her some space.
- I've given her
five years of space.

438
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:37,070
- It was my fault.
- Excuse me?

439
00:27:37,172 --> 00:27:41,442
What happened, the appy, it was
my fault. I knew what I was doing.

440
00:27:41,544 --> 00:27:44,706
So if you want to punish
someone, punish me, not Dr. Yang.

441
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,214
You know who your father is
and he's why you're still here.

442
00:27:48,317 --> 00:27:52,018
So if I were you, I'd stop worrying
about whose fault the appy was

443
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,088
and start figuring out what I
was gonna do to make up for it.

444
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:58,575
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

445
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:08,618
There are people dying right
now. There are people dying.

446
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,888
- It's inappropriate.
- I'm sorry, it's almost 4:00.

447
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,892
- I have to make this decision.
- I'm not talking about
your system.

448
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:19,479
I approve of your system. I was
talking about the brain dead girl.

449
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:22,082
Can't hear her sister,
can't feel her hands.

450
00:28:22,184 --> 00:28:25,703
There are patients dying and
those organs would keep them alive.

451
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:29,172
Leave feelings out of it.
Leave them out of the science.

452
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:33,827
Leave them out of the decision-making
because people are dying as we speak.

Hey. What time is it?

465
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:46,933
Yang, she picked me
for the solo surgery!

466
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:50,187
She did? That's amazing.

467
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,289
I love you.

468
00:29:53,174 --> 00:29:55,659
- What?
- I love you.

469
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:57,778
I friggin' love you.

470
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,415
I just got the solo surgery and
the first thing I did is look for you.

471
00:30:01,517 --> 00:30:05,051
And you weren't there.
You're never there anymore.

472
00:30:05,153 --> 00:30:08,806
I've been thinking about it and it
might be 'cause you love me, too.

473
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:12,876
And you're scared of that.
'Cause I screwed it up last time.

474
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:15,162
- And 'cause Denny died and...
- Alex.

475
00:30:15,264 --> 00:30:19,332
Just listen. You
had that heart patient

476
00:30:19,435 --> 00:30:23,353
and it reminded you of how bad
you felt lying on that bathroom floor.

477
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:26,390
I get that. I get
that you're scared.

478
00:30:26,475 --> 00:30:29,492
But you're not gonna
have to feel like that again.

479
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:33,296
'Cause I'm not gonna die, Iz.
And I'm not gonna cheat on you.

480
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:36,699
I'm not gonna go anywhere.

481
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:39,602
'Cause...

482
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:42,372
I think you're
my best shot at...

483
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:47,944
I think with you,
you make me better.

484
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:52,182
You make me wanna be better.
You make me wanna be good.

485
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:56,202
And I think I can.
With you, I think I can.

486
00:30:56,305 --> 00:30:58,616
I'm not going anywhere.
You can stop hiding.

487
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,742
And if you want to be scared,
that's OK. Just be scared with me.

488
00:31:02,844 --> 00:31:06,580
Be scared while you scrub in
with me for my first solo surgery.

489
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:10,733
- OK?
- You love me.

490
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,486

495
00:31:22,897 --> 00:31:25,582
I'm really starting
to not like that guy.

496
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:34,907
I never should have
said it. I didn't mean it.

497
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:37,310
I never should have said it.

498
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:39,980
Tell her that.

499
00:31:40,082 --> 00:31:42,527
Tell her the last thing
you'd want her to hear.

500
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:45,035
You have to believe if
it were you in this bed

501
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:48,404
and Holly was with you, feeling
bad, you would forgive her.

502
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,473
Tell her.

503
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,798
I'm sorry.

504
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,652
I'm so sorry.

505
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,492
I love you.

506
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,031
She loved you, too.

507
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:15,832
No matter what you said.

508
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:19,069
No matter what happened
between the two of you,

509
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,587
she loved you.

510
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,690
She loves you.

511
00:32:23,792 --> 00:32:25,875
She loves you.

512
00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:57,223

513
00:32:57,325 --> 00:33:01,477
- Cristina and I are fighting.
- Go, talk to her.

514
00:33:02,764 --> 00:33:06,916
She's your best
friend. It's important.

515
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:10,437
Derek?

516
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:16,293
They don't tell you when you
become a doctor it's gonna be like this.

517
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:20,496
They don't tell you that you...

518
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:23,566
lose more patients
than you save.

519
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:26,503
Sixteen.

520
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,873
I'm sick of the death.

521
00:33:32,661 --> 00:33:34,761
I'm sorry.

522
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,981
- I'll see you at home.
- OK.

523
00:33:51,346 --> 00:33:54,914
It's OK. Nobody else
is here. It's just me.

524
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:57,317
And I'm just an
intern. I'm nobody.

525
00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:00,353
So you can try, and if
it doesn't work, it's OK.

526
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:03,606
Just... just try.

527
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,199
Hi.

528
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,059
Hi.

529
00:34:24,546 --> 00:34:25,928
Hi.

530
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,598
Hi.

531
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:34,638
Hi.

532
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,847
Hi.

533
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:46,900
Hi.

534
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:01,498
Hi.

535
00:35:07,822 --> 00:35:10,840
Dr. Dixon, how's your day been?

536
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,310
Feel like you may have
a home at Seattle Grace?

537
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:16,846
Dr. Yang, you tortured her,
making her choose among her peers.

538
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:21,784
Some kind of emotional
torture. Was that your intention?

539
00:35:22,488 --> 00:35:24,170
Yes.

540
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:31,027
Have your board
make me a better offer.

541
00:35:44,859 --> 00:35:48,061
We're fighting, and
I don't want to be.

542
00:35:48,163 --> 00:35:50,030
Let's just put this past us.

543
00:35:50,132 --> 00:35:53,316
What happened with the Chief
and interns, it doesn't matter.

544
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:56,085
That's why you didn't choose
me, why you made it personal.

545
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:58,188
So let's just move on.

546
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,357
You made it personal.

547
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:05,245
This, here, is you making it personal.
You told me to do what I had to do.

548
00:36:05,346 --> 00:36:10,016
So I chose Alex. He's the most
prepared. That's why I didn't choose you.

549
00:36:10,118 --> 00:36:11,751
Not because we're fighting.

550
00:36:11,853 --> 00:36:17,690
Because, unlike you, I can
separate my personal life from my job.

551
00:36:17,793 --> 00:36:19,592
You made it personal.

552
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:37,744
None of you said anything.
Those were all our interns.

553
00:36:38,547 --> 00:36:40,179
But I won this.

554
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,214
They picked me.

555
00:36:42,317 --> 00:36:46,352
If I don't deserve this solo
surgery, then none of us do.

556
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,699
I don't know if I'm more jealous
of Alex or worried about Izzie.

557
00:37:02,203 --> 00:37:04,723
I think something's
wrong with her, Mer.

558
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:07,707
Something's wrong
with all of us, George.

559
00:37:09,778 --> 00:37:11,644
It's Alex.

560
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,669
Not here.

561
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:23,072
Here.

562
00:37:30,232 --> 00:37:33,599
- Hi. You paged?
- I need you
to scrub in with me.

563
00:37:33,701 --> 00:37:36,819
- Where's Izzie?
- I'm freaking out.

564
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,139
I'm freaking out! I
told her I love her.

565
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:44,494
I told her I love her before the
solo surgery. I can't believe that.

566
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,596
She's not gonna
show, I'm freaking out.

567
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:51,434
Stop freaking out. If you screw this up
and kill this guy, I'm gonna be pissed.

568
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:56,056
Then I'll know I should have won it.
You have to kick ass in there, Alex.

569
00:37:56,158 --> 00:37:58,091
You have no choice.

570
00:37:59,394 --> 00:38:01,645
Big night, Karev. You ready?

571
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,433
You ready?

572
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,746

Yes, yeah!
