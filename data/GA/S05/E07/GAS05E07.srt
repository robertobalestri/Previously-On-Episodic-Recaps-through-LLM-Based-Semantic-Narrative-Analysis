1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:03,935
<i>If you're normal,</i>

2
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:06,771
<i>one of the few things you
can count on in life is death.</i>

3
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:14,646
- Hello.
<i>- These are amazing.</i>

4
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:17,666
They're all about the medicine.
There's no personal crap,

5
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:21,269
no talk about boyfriends or feelings.
She hardly even mentions you.

6
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:26,708
Thanks for pointing that out. What about
when she held the retractor six hours?

7
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:29,611
<i>If you're a surgeon, even that
comfort is taken away from you.</i>

8
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:33,314
- Like<i> Harry Potter</i> books
I never had.
- Did you read the part

9
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,261
where she did
the pyloric stenosis

10
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,285
on the three-week-old baby?

11
00:00:37,387 --> 00:00:41,990
<i>♪ I won't bite Oh, come
on and give it to me ♪</i>

12
00:00:42,092 --> 00:00:46,094
<i>Surgeons cheat death,
we prolong it, we deny it.</i>

13
00:00:46,196 --> 00:00:49,197
<i>♪ Oh, I really like it ♪</i>

14
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:54,319
Hold on! He's in v-fib!
Charge to 300! Clear!

15
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:57,555
Up to 360! Clear!

16
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:00,959
<i>We stand and defiantly
give death the finger.</i>

17
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:02,827
Good. Let's go.

18
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,802
Grey, you're late.
She has Skills Lab.

19
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,839
Good morning, Cristina. It
feels like minutes. See you later.

20
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:17,408
No, Tucker, I did not say I
won't do the marriage counseling.

21
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,310
I can't do it in the
mornings again.

22
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,813
I'm now 20 minutes
late for work.

23
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,365
- I'll see you tonight.
- Marriage counseling?

24
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:27,419
- How's that going?
- You heard us arguing about it.

25
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:28,987
How you think it's going?

26
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,807
You're doing a craniotomy on
my patient Rosemary Bullard today.

27
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:35,209
Gonna be awake or
yawning into her brain?

28
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:38,379
- Meredith kept me up.
- Don't need to hear
your dirty...

29
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:39,841
Talking on the
phone with Cristina.

30
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:41,928
Aw, and stole your sleep?

31
00:01:41,952 --> 00:01:43,796
Did you say,
"Yang goes or I go"?

32
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,420
I don't think I'd win that one.

33
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:49,007
- Those two come as a set.
- Before, she had Burke. Burke helped.

34
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,243
- True.
- Counseling's a good move.

35
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:57,215
- Addison and I did counseling.
- Right before you got divorced?

36
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:00,953
Ladies and gentlemen,
allow me to introduce...

37
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,788
Stan.

38
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,391
State-of-the-art
computerized patient simulator.

39
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:09,093
Stan can educate you
in airway management,

40
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,007
trauma assessment and care.

41
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:14,399
He breathes, he
pulsates, he seizes,

42
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:19,153
he hemorrhages, he secretes.
And he speaks. Hello, Stan.

43
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:22,207
<i>Hello, doctor. I'm
not feeling well.</i>

44
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,137
Stan will say what he needs.

45
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:26,356
He's more forgiving
than most patients.

46
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,808
You kill him, he'll keep
coming back for more.

47
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:31,282
Make good use of him, people.

48
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:34,102
- We're operating on robots?
- Can we go back to pigs?

49
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:36,688
- What about people?
- When the chief decides who

50
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,907
gets the first solo
surgery, be ready.

51
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:40,492
Solo surgery?

52
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:43,061
- When do we find out?
- Is he deciding soon?

53
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:47,382
I do not know what it will be,
I do not know when it will be.

54
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:50,451
I do know that the
winner should be prepared

55
00:02:50,553 --> 00:02:51,887
to do any surgical procedure,

56
00:02:51,988 --> 00:02:55,023
and will choose
one intern to scrub in.

57
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,060
So practice your skills,
impress your attendings

58
00:02:58,162 --> 00:03:00,595
and do not make me look stupid.

59
00:03:00,697 --> 00:03:02,581
Grey, Stevens, you're with Hahn.

60
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,566
Yang, the pit.
Karev and O'Malley,

61
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:07,118
- you're Skills Lab. Get to know...
- Dibs!

62
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,839
- Mine.
- <i>I am having chest pain.</i>

63
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:14,326
Just to be clear, we are not
cracking open any chests today?

64
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:18,597
- No, Stevens.
- With solo surgery coming up,

65
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,815
we were hoping to
be on a cool surgical...

66
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:22,584
I'm gonna stop you right there.

67
00:03:22,686 --> 00:03:25,654
I don't get attached to
patients. But I like this guy.

68
00:03:25,756 --> 00:03:28,222
I have spent almost two
years giving his family hope

69
00:03:28,325 --> 00:03:31,693
and then taking it away. This
procedure can buy him time

70
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,761
until he gets another
shot at a transplant.

71
00:03:33,864 --> 00:03:35,029
Make sure it works.

72
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,865
- Absolutely.
- Of course.

73
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:40,669
- Familiar with the case?
- Michael Norris,
44-year old male

74
00:03:40,771 --> 00:03:43,888
with congenital hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy who has failed

75
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,858
treatment at Seattle Pres.
Waiting on a transplant

76
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,661
since narrowly missing out
on one on May 14th of 2000.

77
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:52,981
- Wait. May 14th?
- What?

78
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:58,770
- What?
- That's... That's Denny's heart.

79
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,741
That's the heart
I stole for Denny.

80
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,987
I need you to have
sex with Cristina Yang.

81
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,071
Good morning.

82
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,642
Distract. Give her something
to do besides call my girlfriend

83
00:04:20,744 --> 00:04:23,745
- and wake me up.
- Yang. No.

84
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,749
No. Too serious. Humorless.
Un-fun. Not my type.

85
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,368
Yang should be your type.

86
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,037
She's intense,
intelligent, complicated.

87
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,205
She's like a single-malt Scotch.

88
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,090
And you are used
to... beer bongs.

89
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:40,812
- Callie Torres is no beer bong.
- Wait, I get it.

90
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:44,232
You don't think you have a
shot. You're probably right.

91
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:46,568
- Oh, I have a shot.
- Then try. As a favor to me.

92
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,104
No. I'm not your stud horse.

93
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,957
- You can't just tell me to...
- You slept with my wife.

94
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:56,494
Yeah, I'll give it a shot.

95
00:04:57,748 --> 00:05:00,582
- Is that too tight?
- OK, yeah.

96
00:05:00,684 --> 00:05:03,251
- OK.
- Feels pretty good.

97
00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:08,656
- OK, good.
- Put one...

98
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:11,242
Are you guys shooting
drugs? Oh, my God!

99
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:14,512
- No, we're practicing IVs.
- How else are we supposed
to learn?

100
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,348
- Yang never lets us
do anything.
- Practicing on each other?

101
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,945
We did it at Baylor, it's cool.

102
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:20,780
No. It's not cool. It's crazy.

103
00:05:20,804 --> 00:05:24,922
- Like creepy, basement crazy.
- Don't tell anyone!

104
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,109
- Don't worry.
- I'm next.

105
00:05:27,211 --> 00:05:28,576
Hold still now.

106
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:34,533
Ah, Dr. Hunt, got a second?

107
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,980
It's about to get loud
in here, but shoot.

108
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:42,257
We're awarding a solo surgery to a
second-year resident. I want your take.

109
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:45,060
- One second.
- Unidentified male,
mid-thirties.

110
00:05:45,162 --> 00:05:47,340
Lost vitals, shocked
him into sinus tach.

111
00:05:47,364 --> 00:05:50,031
- Possible fractures of arms.
- OK, on three.

112
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:54,869
- Two, three. Good, good.
- Open right tib/fib,
rigid abdomen.

113
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:57,505
- What doesn't he have?
- Found under an overpass.

114
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:00,759
- Cops thinks someone
threw him over.
- After they beat him to death?

115
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,861
- It's a contest,
the solo surgery?
- You have fresh eyes.

116
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,848
You don't know them personally,
you don't have any history,

117
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,568
any relationship. That
perspective is rare here.

118
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,953
I'll give it some thought.

119
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:14,606
Dr. Webber, regarding
the solo surgery, I presume

120
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,676
it's gonna be a general
surgery? I wanna be prepared...

121
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,894
You'll know when you all know.

122
00:06:19,996 --> 00:06:22,530
And one more thing. If
my ER reports are right,

123
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,167
you've been working three
days. When do you sleep?

124
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:27,702
Keep tabs on all attendings?

125
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,739
- His IV blew.
- He needs that access now!

126
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:33,658
- I'm doing it.
- This will buy him some time

127
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:36,895
- until you get that line in.
- Yeah.

128
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:41,132
If you were less worried about winning
contests, you might have thought of it.

129
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:51,325
So you're gonna give me
a heart attack? Literally?

130
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:54,996
Uh... It's a technique
called "alcohol ablation."

131
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:58,216
Through a catheter
in your femoral artery,

132
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:01,268
Dr. Hahn will inject ethanol
straight into your heart.

133
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:05,607
The alcohol will incinerate
any tissue cells it touches.

134
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,429
- Dr. Stevens?
- Um...

135
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:14,415
We're gonna be burning away
the muscle in your ventricle

136
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:18,052
that's blocking your
ability to get oxygen.

137
00:07:18,154 --> 00:07:22,340
If we're successful, you
should feel immediate relief.

138
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,910
Just like that? I'll
be able to breathe?

139
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,546
- Just like that.
- And he can't be asleep

140
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,682
- during the procedure?
- I'm afraid not.

141
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:35,786
Dr. Stevens will be asking you
to cough, inhale and exhale...

142
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,339
And checking to
see if I'm dead yet?

143
00:07:38,441 --> 00:07:40,175
Mike, stop.

144
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:43,528
I mean, it is a
heart attack, right?

145
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,497
It's a dangerous procedure.

146
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,951
But it's one we can monitor
and control. If you don't have it,

147
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:53,855
the next heart attack you
have, and you will have one...

148
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:55,790
It'll kill me.

149
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,071
Promise you'll keep me awake.

150
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:02,329
I... I don't want to miss this.

151
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:12,707
I want Mike's latest echo and
angio before he goes to the cath lab.

152
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:15,610
- Wow! Are you freaking out?
- What?

153
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:19,597
- Why? Do you think I should be?
- This patient? In Denny's room?

154
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,901
- It's a lot of Denny
for one day.
- It is a lot.

155
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:28,139
A lot. Is it a lot of
Denny for you, too?

156
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:31,742
I mean, how much Denny
are you experiencing?

157
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,195
Iz, you can do this.

158
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:41,552
- <i>My pain is getting worse.
</i>- I hate this.

159
00:08:41,638 --> 00:08:43,516
I'm not gonna win
the solo surgery

160
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,140
practicing on Plastic Man.

161
00:08:45,242 --> 00:08:47,542
You're not gonna
win because you suck.

162
00:08:47,644 --> 00:08:50,144
<i>Your bedside
manner is what sucks.</i>

163
00:08:50,246 --> 00:08:53,782
- What? What did you say?
- Ain't technology amazing?

164
00:08:53,884 --> 00:08:55,767
Screw this. I'm gonna
practice medicine.

165
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,168
You play with your doll.

166
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,905
<i>What's the matter?
Scared of a little education?</i>

167
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:09,297
You are so awesome!
You are so awesome!

168
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:12,334
- <i>Ow.</i>
- No! No! No! No! Stan!

169
00:09:12,436 --> 00:09:15,153
What's a guy have to do
to get a beating this bad?

170
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,472
Maybe he'll tell us
when he wakes up.

171
00:09:17,574 --> 00:09:20,708
Let's hope he
makes it that long.

172
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,776
Three, run these to the lab,

173
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,412
then go by the morgue
and get the forms

174
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:26,692
- for an unclaimed body.
- He's gonna need a chest tube.

175
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:29,067
I was hoping, with solo
surgery coming up...

176
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,536
With the solo surgery coming up,
your job is to impress me. So, go.

177
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,606
Dr. Yang, with the
solo surgery coming up,

178
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,191
your job is to impress me.

179
00:09:36,293 --> 00:09:40,028
- You're planning for his death.
- I was trying to be prepared. Sorry.

180
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,364
I can't use sorry. I
could use a doctor.

181
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,181
Be one.

182
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:49,537
The kind of metastases you have
are prone to spontaneous bleeding.

183
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:53,842
So there are considerable
risks to the surgery.

184
00:09:53,944 --> 00:09:56,144
- You're saying this one...
- Might be dicier.

185
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:59,196
Much dicier than
previous surgeries.

186
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,099
I want to be clear,
you can live with this.

187
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,867
For months, if not longer.

188
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,752
Not... Not like this.

189
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:08,990
Not feeling this bad.

190
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:12,109
I understand risks
are part of the package.

191
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:16,530
That's why you people make me
go cross-eyed signing all these forms.

192
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:18,867
You're signing a "Do
Not Resuscitate" order?

193
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:20,249
If it's my time to go...

194
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:22,448
She doesn't want to be
on life-support kind of thing.

195
00:10:22,472 --> 00:10:25,723
- She'd hate that.
- I just hate lying
around like that.

196
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,325
I don't want that.

197
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,426
OK.

198
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:36,617
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, love.

199
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:53,934
Sorry. We do this every time.

200
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:57,505
She signs the paper,
we kiss goodbye.

201
00:10:57,607 --> 00:11:02,126
Then after the surgery,
we say hello again.

202
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,479
That sounds like a plan to me.

203
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:07,615
You rest up. We'll be
bringing you up soon.

204
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,103
That there is the
Holy Grail of marriage.

205
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:13,955
Something to aspire to.

206
00:11:14,057 --> 00:11:17,942
- What happens to them?
- You sign, attending signs,

207
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:21,362
- pink copy goes in his chart.
- No, I mean the bodies.

208
00:11:21,464 --> 00:11:23,647
The unclaimed bodies.
What happens to them?

209
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,417
If they remained unclaimed for
a certain time, they're cremated,

210
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,103
- the ones that haven't
been preserved.
- Preserved?

211
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:30,872
For medical research,
gross anatomy,

212
00:11:30,974 --> 00:11:35,476
- surgical study,
that sort of thing.
- For, like, med students?

213
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:38,096
Exactly. For med students.

214
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,832
To practice on?

215
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:43,985
You're pretty.

216
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,444
Um...

217
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:56,698
Thank you all for being here. I
appreciate the opportunity to learn

218
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,700
and I'm sorry you had to die.

219
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:01,102
Oh! Uh... Instrument trays!

220
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:04,272
- We got a rhythm.
- We got to get him up to surgery.

221
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,642
- He's bleeding through
his leg splint.
- So the chief has asked me

222
00:12:07,744 --> 00:12:09,978
to watch the second
years for the solo surgery.

223
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,714
- What's your take, as a class?
- They're a mixed bag.

224
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,548
Yang's very good.

225
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,402
She's... hardcore.
She'll be a cardio god.

226
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,487
- She's my roommate.
- And Stevens?

227
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:23,975
She's smart. Good with patients,
very compassionate, supposedly.

228
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,728
She did sleep with my
ex-husband while we were married.

229
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,564
I'm more interested
in the doctor part.

230
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,650
Right. Obviously.
Of course you are.

231
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,588
New scans, good.

232
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,423
Splenic subcapsular hematoma...

233
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,326
I can look. Go update his chart.

234
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:51,319
- Dr. Yang, you paged me?
- Patient in
Trauma One.

235
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,855
You paged me for a consult? I
was hoping you wanted to see me.

236
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:58,359
I did. The patient has a
shattered nose and cheekbones

237
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:01,512
and a fractured left
mandible. Trauma One.

238
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:10,321
OK, Mike, the catheters
are in. It's time to inject.

239
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:13,924
OK, just hold tight.
Stevens, over here, please.

240
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:19,097
I specifically chose you for this case
because you connect well with patients.

241
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:22,734
That's something I've been
told to work on not doing.

242
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,568
Mike needs you talking to him.

243
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,505
He's scared, his pulse
is elevating, step up.

244
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,541
OK.

245
00:13:31,595 --> 00:13:35,596
Hey, Mike, you're doing great.

246
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:40,951
You're gonna feel
a little bit of burning.

247
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:44,172
Will that make it...?

248
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:46,507
There it is. Oh, God!

249
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:50,728
- Try not to move.
- Try to lay still. Try to breathe.

250
00:13:51,948 --> 00:13:55,266
- Make it stop!
- Mike, we can't stop

251
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:58,202
but it's gonna end soon. Hang
in there. Stevens, talk to him.

252
00:13:58,288 --> 00:14:01,038
- I'm sorry.
- - Grey, how's his pressure?

253
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,107
Eighty-five systolic.

254
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:06,444
Stevens, talk! Help him!

255
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:09,981
Stevens, get him to
cough. Get him to breathe.

256
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,700
- Stevens!
- Pressure's stabilizing.

257
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:14,935
OK, how you doing, Mike?

258
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:22,643
I still... can't breathe.

259
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:25,113
Does that mean
we're not successful?

260
00:14:25,215 --> 00:14:28,382
There were two arterial
routes I could choose.

261
00:14:28,484 --> 00:14:31,852
- The next time we do this...
- No. I can't...

262
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:36,807
I won't do this again.
Please, I can't do this again.

263
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,744
I'm sorry.

264
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,662
I'm so sorry.

265
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,571
Tell Stevens to find me

266
00:14:50,673 --> 00:14:52,673
so I can permanently
throw her off my service.

267
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:55,343
Dr. Hahn, I know you have
a history with this patient.

268
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:57,155
In a weird way, Izzie does, too.

269
00:14:57,179 --> 00:14:59,747
A history? With my patient?

270
00:14:59,849 --> 00:15:02,883
No, with Denny Duquette.

271
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:05,336
Tell her to find me.

272
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,593
The tumor's position
has been altered.

273
00:15:12,695 --> 00:15:15,830
I need an ultrasound
localization.

274
00:15:15,932 --> 00:15:17,893
I took care of the Yang
problem, by the way.

275
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,986
Already? That sounds too easy.

276
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,389
If it doesn't feel like
work, it's not going to work.

277
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,825
Where did you learn
that? Marriage counseling?

278
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,293
Of course not.

279
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:33,947
It's a complete waste of
time. This couple, the Bullards,

280
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:35,878
I bet they never got counseling.

281
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:39,053
They just take the
bad with the good.

282
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:42,773
Damn it. Tumor's hemorrhaging.
Her brain's starting to swell.

283
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,626
- Push 70 of mannitol!
- She's bradying down.

284
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:51,048
One of atropine. Let's make sure
these two get a chance to say hello again.

285
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,424
- Have you seen Izzie?
- No.

286
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:02,593
You got anything I can scrub
in on? Robo-patient sucks.

287
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,696
Listen, Izzie is having a
rough day. So if you see her...

288
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,566
- No, I'm having a rough day.
- What happened?

289
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:11,101
Hunt. Hunt hates
me. He hates me!

290
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:13,538
- He kissed you.
- Yes.

291
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,674
That was... before.
Now, he hates my guts.

292
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:19,344
This is worse than Hahn.
I have no idea what I did

293
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:22,229
or said or what?

294
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:24,148
I gotta get off this case.

295
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,085
Ah! Dr. Yang.

296
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,471
Our guy scheduled for
surgery? I want to know when

297
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,506
- I'm gonna see you next?
- He's not stable.

298
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:34,670
Oh! Then we
might have time to...

299
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,861
I've just been paged down.

300
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:39,763
This does not happen to me.

301
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:42,917
Bow to me, for I am
the queen of the interns.

302
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:46,087
I have assembled an army
of the dead to teach us things.

303
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:49,040
Cadavers. I got us cadavers
to practice on. A whole bunch.

304
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,209
You got cadavers?
Human cadavers?

305
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:53,911
In the tunnels.
Meet there for lunch.

306
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,654
- Hey.
- Hey.

307
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:07,091
Let me ask you something.
Do you know if Izzie Stevens

308
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:10,061
had some sort of a relationship
with Denny Duquette?

309
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:15,093
You mean, besides
the engagement?

310
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,695
And the cutting his LVAD wire

311
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:19,353
so she could move him
up the transplant list?

312
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,739
Izzie was on probationary leave.

313
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:24,341
She was nearly kicked
out of the program.

314
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,245
- I forget you weren't
here then.
- No, I wasn't.

315
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:28,846
I was at another hospital,

316
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:32,250
watching my patient's heart
get stolen out of his chest.

317
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:37,071
Did you page me
down here for sex?

318
00:17:37,173 --> 00:17:39,339
Because I'm not
really in the mood.

319
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:41,475
- Want to see some dead guys?
- Why?

320
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:44,144
- Come on.
- Why would you say that? Why?

321
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:46,030
Cadavers.

322
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:49,049
- For practice. For solo surgery.
- What is this?

323
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,735
I heard you were
having a crappy day.

324
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,153
I thought this
would cheer you up.

325
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,894
- What?
- It's like a bouquet.

326
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,162
Of corpses. That is so...

327
00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:05,966
I'm sorry. No. That's
crazy. He's dead.

328
00:18:06,068 --> 00:18:09,587
He's dead. Just so
many dead people today.

329
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:17,778
- These are for interns!
- Go play with the dummy!

330
00:18:19,582 --> 00:18:22,349
- Come on!
- <i>I cannot help it.</i>

331
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:25,452
- <i>I'm dying.</i>
- But I'm applying pressure!

332
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:27,983
<i>Must be something
you're forgetting.</i>

333
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:30,808
- For crying out loud!
- <i>I'm surprised you even passed</i>

334
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,627
- <i>your intern exam.</i>
- Oh, my God!

335
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,734
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

336
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,324
- Chief, I have to talk to you.
- Hey, Hahn, come in.

337
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:51,495
I want you to watch
this. Let's blow an artery.

338
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:55,266
I'm bleeding out!
I'm bleeding out.

339
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:58,469
It's about Izzie Stevens
and Denny Duquette.

340
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,290
How is Stevens
still working here?

341
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,425
How is Seattle
Grace still accredited?

342
00:19:05,527 --> 00:19:09,029
This thing goes unreported? No
wonder this place is number 12!

343
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:13,517
- Stop right there.
- I want an ethics panel
assembled.

344
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,904
I want Stevens's role in this
investigated and Bailey's as well.

345
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:18,973
- She was her superior...
- Slow!

346
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,575
No! My patient lost
a heart over this.

347
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:23,405
Someone is gonna lose their job!

348
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:26,279
Stop! We are not
digging this up.

349
00:19:26,381 --> 00:19:29,700
It didn't go unreported. It was
reported to me. I dealt with it.

350
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:33,337
Stevens was punished. She's
learned and she's on her way

351
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:37,375
to becoming an excellent surgeon.
That's the kind of hospital I'm running.

352
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:39,003
This issue has
been laid to rest.

353
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:41,545
It's in the past,
that's where it stays.

354
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,014
It's not in the past for me!

355
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:47,000
It's lying on a bed in
the ICU, about to die!

356
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:50,954
Then your responsibility is to
make sure that doesn't happen.

357
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:06,037
It was a difficult surgery,
especially at her age.

358
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:09,323
We're not sure how
she's going to respond.

359
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:11,925
Oh, sure.

360
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:16,830
The waiting is
always the hard part.

361
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:23,104
- Ed, she might not make it.
- I know.

362
00:20:23,206 --> 00:20:25,005
I know.

363
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,997
Iz.

364
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:56,270
- You're hiding from Hahn?
- Sure. Her, too.

365
00:20:56,372 --> 00:21:00,074
- Is Mike OK?
- No. The ablation failed.

366
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:04,512
He's refusing to try
again, so Hahn's... Um...

367
00:21:04,613 --> 00:21:08,682
- You should go talk to her.
- I stole his heart, Meredith.

368
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:11,085
I stole it for Denny.
I stole it for myself.

369
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:14,454
And now I'm supposed to hold
his hand while we torture him?

370
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:18,458
I can't even look at him.
It's my fault that he's here.

371
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:25,632
So, anyway, I'm hiding.

372
00:21:31,907 --> 00:21:35,125
Yang, suction here, please.

373
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:39,797
Sloan's coming in for
the mandibular repair?

374
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:45,052
Sorry about before. Everybody's
up in everybody else's business here.

375
00:21:45,154 --> 00:21:48,222
Better to keep things
professional, if you can.

376
00:21:48,323 --> 00:21:50,825
Yes. One minute you're
working with people,

377
00:21:50,927 --> 00:21:53,928
then you're friends with
them and then... whatever.

378
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:57,497
Suddenly there's all this
pressure to define what you are,

379
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:00,433
like it's all black and white.
You are this or you're that.

380
00:22:00,535 --> 00:22:02,986
You are aware you're
doing it again, right?

381
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,522
Dr. Hunt? How's our mystery man?

382
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,285
Still with us. He's a fighter.

383
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:09,843
Hate to be the
other guy. Callie.

384
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,148
Dr. Yang, I know cracking
chests is more your thing,

385
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,518
but you'd be surprised how exciting it
can be when I manipulate a little skin.

386
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,155
Actually, Dr. Yang,
why don't you scrub out.

387
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,168
We've got enough hands in here.

388
00:22:23,192 --> 00:22:24,542
OK.

389
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,456
Hey, I heard he went
up. Can I scrub in?

390
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,716
Shut it. If I'm not in,
you're not in. You stink.

391
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,185
- I showered.
- You smell like formaldehyde.

392
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,337
You smell like death.

393
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,356
Why do you smell like death?

394
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:40,942
Uh...

395
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,678
I see dead people!

396
00:22:46,349 --> 00:22:47,959
- Get out.
- I need off Hunt case.

397
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:49,177
In a one-time offer,

398
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,802
I'll trade my beaten-to-a-pulp
trauma-palooza

399
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:57,257
of a patient for no less than
three of your cadavers. Pony up.

400
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:59,560
Deal. Take three.

401
00:23:02,698 --> 00:23:05,282
I need to be with people.

402
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,235
Preferably live
people, but whatever.

403
00:23:08,337 --> 00:23:11,738
Alex, by the way, thank you
for bringing me the corpses.

404
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,773
It was very sweet.

405
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,707
Dr. Hunt and Dr. Sloan
are still operating.

406
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,430
- Could I try...?
- No!

407
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:24,451
Check this out: my dead mommy
taught me a cool way to hold instruments.

408
00:23:24,553 --> 00:23:28,088
If you palm it, you
can switch off faster.

409
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:32,092
When your dead mommy teaches
you things, can you see her?

410
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:36,980
- No. I'm reading her journals.
- Duh, I was kidding. Obviously.

411
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,534
I did see her once, though.
And that bomb squad guy.

412
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:44,154
And Denny.

413
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,877
- Today?
- No. I was dead at the time.

414
00:23:49,979 --> 00:23:52,179
I feel my mom with me sometimes.

415
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:53,931
I got to get off this case.

416
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,834
<i>♪ Some people have nothing
and want nothing and are free ♪</i>

417
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,919
<i>♪ Some people want
to burn the world ♪</i>

418
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,704
- Could I...?
- No!

419
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:04,158
Please don't be in there,
please don't be in there.

420
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:07,027
Please don't be in there.

421
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,625
Dr. Hahn, I came to apologize

422
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:25,412
and ask if I could please
be let off your service.

423
00:24:25,514 --> 00:24:29,633
No. If I can convince Mike
to have another ablation,

424
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:32,419
you're gonna be there
to see him through it,

425
00:24:32,521 --> 00:24:34,371
to look him in the eye,

426
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:38,292
to help him through the pain
that you have caused him.

427
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,427
If he dies, I want
you there for that too,

428
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:42,045
because you're responsible.

429
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,966
He decided. He won't
do another procedure.

430
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:50,704
I'm going to...
go check him out.

431
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:57,878
Dr. Stevens.

432
00:25:01,117 --> 00:25:05,802
She'll be OK. This has...

433
00:25:05,905 --> 00:25:08,438
This has been
coming for a long time.

434
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:13,994
She'll be OK. She'll...
She'll move on.

435
00:25:15,898 --> 00:25:18,765
If you die,

436
00:25:18,867 --> 00:25:21,868
she will not get over it.

437
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,504
She will not move on.

438
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:26,140
She'll think she can.
She'll even think she has.

439
00:25:26,242 --> 00:25:29,026
And out of the blue, you'll
be right there with her,

440
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:32,696
so close she'll think she can
touch you, and then all of this

441
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:35,565
will just...

442
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:39,370
be happening for
her all over again.

443
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,306
She will not be able to move on.

444
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,114
They're not doing anything.
Make them do something!

445
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:54,851
- They're standing around!
- They're keeping her
comfortable.

446
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:57,637
That's all they can do.
You and Rosie agreed,

447
00:25:57,739 --> 00:26:02,626
there would be no extreme measures
taken if her time came. Her time is here.

448
00:26:02,711 --> 00:26:05,529
- What's going on?
- She's coding.

449
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:08,782
And Mr. Bullard is
reconsidering the DNR order.

450
00:26:08,884 --> 00:26:12,502
Ed, this was what I warned
you about. This moment.

451
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,671
Even if we try to
resuscitate her,

452
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,924
I'm not sure she'll
wake up again.

453
00:26:17,026 --> 00:26:19,826
Nothing more we can do.

454
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,453
Rosie.

455
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:37,695
Rosie? Hon?

456
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:41,681
Rosie.

457
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:46,887
No.

458
00:26:54,497 --> 00:26:56,046
Stay with me, Rosie.

459
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:59,533
Rosie? Stay with me.

460
00:26:59,635 --> 00:27:05,072
Don't leave me, Rosie. Stay
with me, Rosie. Don't leave me.

461
00:27:05,174 --> 00:27:08,041
Stay with me. Stay
with me, Rosie!

462
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,545
Stay with me. Come
back, Rosie! Don't leave me.

463
00:27:11,647 --> 00:27:14,515
Stay with me. Don't leave me.

464
00:27:14,617 --> 00:27:17,234
Stay with me,
Rosie. Stay with me.

465
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:22,138
Stay with me. Don't leave me.

466
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,876
Stay with me, Rosie.
Don't leave me.

467
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:28,662
Stay with me. Don't leave me.

468
00:27:28,764 --> 00:27:30,263
Stay with me, Rosie.

469
00:27:30,365 --> 00:27:31,731
Please, Rosie. No!

470
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:33,866
- Please don't...
- Mr. Bullard.

471
00:27:33,969 --> 00:27:35,669
Do something for
her! Do something!

472
00:27:35,771 --> 00:27:37,521
- Mr. Bullard - No! No!

473
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:42,309
- Let him be. Let him be.
- Please, Rosie.

474
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,327
Please.

475
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:50,266
I'm glad you
decided to try again.

476
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:54,771
You can thank Dr. Stevens.
It's her fault we're here, right?

477
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:57,607
Vitals are stable, he's
ready for the injection.

478
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:02,496
- The alcohol is going in.
- No, wait. Wait, don't.

479
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:05,749
Mike, look at me.
Just stay with me.

480
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:09,920
It's going to hurt, but not as
much as you think it's going to.

481
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,661
He's in SVT. There may be
alcohol backing into his AV node.

482
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:19,603
Get him to cough,
get him to breathe.

483
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:22,015
You need to breathe.
Cough for me.

484
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,335
Look at me, Mike. Look at me!

485
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,931
He's in V-tach,
losing consciousness.

486
00:28:38,033 --> 00:28:41,801
Push 100 of lidocaine. Ready.

487
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:51,528
Oh, man. It's Lexie.

488
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,481
I gotta go. Beaten-to-a-pulp
Guy is coding.

489
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:59,069
Oh, no. Pulp Guy
is mine. We traded!

490
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:03,673
- Why didn't you
put in a chest tube?
- I don't know how.

491
00:29:03,758 --> 00:29:06,577
What do you mean? I
learned that my first week.

492
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:08,945
Yes, you learned. You
know, but I'll never know

493
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,680
because you
won't let me try one,

494
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:14,334
but you hog all our robots
and you steal all our corpses!

495
00:29:14,436 --> 00:29:19,823
Dude, I think you broke
her. Vitals are stable, for now.

496
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,459
Was there this much
blood in his urine before?

497
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:23,710
No.

498
00:29:23,812 --> 00:29:26,379
- Bedside cystogram.
- Dibs on that.

499
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:28,526
It's mine. His bladder
repair is mine, too.

500
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:31,062
- We traded, I get his bladder.
- We never traded.

501
00:29:31,086 --> 00:29:33,264
To prove you wrong,
next time he crashes,

502
00:29:33,288 --> 00:29:34,621
you put in his chest tube.

503
00:29:34,723 --> 00:29:37,707
Get away from
that man right now!

504
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:40,938
He was crashing, so
we upped his dopamine...

505
00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:43,547
Are you deaf, Karev? I
said step away from him.

506
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:46,917
- We were saving his life...
- What you did was pick him over

507
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:50,153
like vultures, like a bunch
of children fighting over toys.

508
00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:52,856
You treat a man fighting
to live as if he was dead.

509
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:56,210
You have no sense, no
decency and no respect!

510
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,732

Her heart is no longer

00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,792
on our beating victim
before you leave.

546
00:33:31,894 --> 00:33:35,812
I'm sorry, did you
say something?

547
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:39,983
- Yang, what is wrong with you?
- Sir?

548
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:43,937
I have had women opt for needless
elective buttock enhancement surgery

549
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:46,890
just for another chance
to be flirted with by me.

550
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:48,808
So, what's your deal?

551
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:51,912
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

552
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:56,048
I have been hitting

553
00:33:57,352 --> 00:33:59,102
Oh... I...

554
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,488
Really? Oh...

555
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:05,675
Excuse me.

556
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:08,678
It was a stupid idea!
It wasn't even my idea.

557
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,180
It was Shepherd's idea.

558
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:13,933
- Oh, come on.
- That woman is not
single-malt Scotch.

559
00:34:14,035 --> 00:34:18,888
She is bad, cheap wine that gives you
a headache you can feel in your teeth.

560
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:26,363
Dr. Hunt. Any thoughts on
the second-years after today?

561
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:31,834
- It's only been a day, sir.
- Of course.

562
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:33,303
They're undisciplined,

563
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,856
inarticulate and they have
a lot to learn about respect.

564
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:38,424
Mostly, they're more
interested in personal crap.

565
00:34:38,526 --> 00:34:41,294
I'm not sure they're being
taught anything different.

566
00:34:41,396 --> 00:34:45,248
Honestly, I'm not sure I'll
be staying on. Excuse me, sir.

567
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:54,907
Tell me I am not
seeing what I'm seeing.

568
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:58,711
Tell me I am not
seeing a room full

569
00:34:58,813 --> 00:35:02,215
of human bodies half-open,

570
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:05,401
- scattered and forgotten about.
- They're unclaimed bodies.

571
00:35:05,504 --> 00:35:07,337
Unclaimed.

572
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:11,808
Each one of these
people was loved.

573
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:16,312
Each one of these people
was somebody's somebody.

574
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:20,450
So we are responsible
for treating them as such.

575
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:25,688
We claim them and
treat them with respect!

576
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,844
Close them up, cover them up

577
00:35:31,947 --> 00:35:34,880
and put them back
where they belong.

578
00:35:34,982 --> 00:35:36,833
Now!

579
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:51,781
The wife's here of the beating
victim. She ID'd her husband.

580
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,600
What's his name?

581
00:35:53,702 --> 00:35:56,268
I wondered if you asked his name

582
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:58,588
so that he could
become a person to you.

583
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:01,558
They're all people. This
is not a game or a contest

584
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,493
or a competition to see who
gets surgery and who doesn't.

585
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,395
They're people, and
we get to save them.

586
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,581
Now, you're good.
You're excellent.

587
00:36:08,683 --> 00:36:09,949
You can win all the contests.

588
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:12,702
If that's why you're doing
this, you shouldn't be.

589
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,172
Did you find out his name?

590
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:34,390
My dad died when I was
nine in a car accident.

591
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:37,961
I was with him in the car. While
we waited for the ambulance,

592
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:41,964
I tried to keep his chest closed
so he wouldn't bleed so much.

593
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:46,269
When he died...

594
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:52,858
my hands felt his
heart stop beating.

595
00:36:55,229 --> 00:36:57,497
That's why I do this.

596
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:01,885
It's also why I win
all the contests.

597
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:08,024
The patient's name is Tom.

598
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,468
Single-malt Scotch.

599
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:26,860

00:37:32,968 --> 00:37:35,251

602
00:37:38,106 --> 00:37:43,260
- Yes! You don't get to die!
- Nice job.

603
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:46,579
Oh, hi. Thanks. I, uh...

604
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,467
You know, he's just a robot.

605
00:37:51,987 --> 00:37:55,788
I want to take back what I
said before about leaving.

606
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:58,908
I was overreacting.
I was just...

607
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,162
It was personal. I wondered
if you could forget about it?

608

621

625
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:15,134
Well, he still needs a heart,
but I bought him some time.

626
00:39:15,236 --> 00:39:19,088
- Good, I'm glad.
- I went to the chief
about Izzie

627
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,257
and he completely shut me down.

628
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,759
We'll see what he says
when I report this to UNOS.

629
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,029
Whoa. Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Wait, why?

630
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,975
What good would come of that?

631
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:30,967
- What do you mean?
- What possible good
would it do?

632
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:33,064
Benefit your patient's outcome?

633
00:39:33,088 --> 00:39:35,588
My patient wouldn't be
here, if it wasn't for her.

634
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:40,426
Your gonna report to UNOS and cost
this hospital its transplant certification?

635
00:39:40,528 --> 00:39:43,245
Cost our patients organs,
cost people their jobs,

636
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:46,883
- cost Izzie Stevens her career?
- You're taking Izzie's side?

637
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:49,602
- Over mine?
- She's a doctor,
one of our doctors.

638
00:39:49,704 --> 00:39:52,555
There's a reason we
have each other's backs.

639
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:55,007
Do not talk to me about
a code. This is not that.

640
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:58,277
No, this is that. I don't
know what happened

middle of that situation,

643
00:40:02,283 --> 00:40:03,894
I don't see how you
make a judgment.

644
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:06,068
Easy. There's right and wrong.

645
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:09,389
And this was wrong. And illegal.

646
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:14,743
There is no gray area here.
You can't kind of think this is OK.

647
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:17,930
You can't kind of side
with Izzie Stevens.

648
00:40:18,032 --> 00:40:21,150
And you can't
kind of be a lesbian.

That's why I had that patient today
and that's why I helped save his life.

665
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:29,969
So I wouldn't feel
guilty anymore,

666
00:41:30,005 --> 00:41:33,139
and I can move on. So, please...

667
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:37,660
- you have to go.
- Go where?

668
00:41:38,947 --> 00:41:42,682
- Are you OK?
- Yes. Yes.

669
00:41:42,784 --> 00:41:45,534
I am totally OK.

670
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:48,171
I'm fine. Everything's fine.

671
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:51,140
I have to change but I'll
meet you at the bar, OK?

672
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,675
OK.

673
00:41:54,913 --> 00:41:59,949
<i>In fact, there's only one thing
about life we can be sure of.</i>

674
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,943
Are you sure you're OK?

675
00:42:17,051 --> 00:42:19,918
<i>It ain't over, till it's over.</i>
