1
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:07,706
You never know the biggest day of
your life is going to be the biggest.

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,379
The days you think are
going to be big ones...

3
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:19,051
They're never as big as you
make them out to be in your head.

4
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:24,390
It's the regular days.

5
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:30,362
The ones that start out normal.

6
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:35,334
Those are the days that
end up being the biggest.

7
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:39,204
And today was the wedding.

8
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:41,706
It was beautiful.

9
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,643
Perfect.

10
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:49,948
- Just a normal day.
- Normal day.

11
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:51,366
Going to work.

12
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:56,638
Just a normal day that ends in
a ceremony in a churchy church.

13
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,276
This has nothing to do with us.
We're just the bride and groom.

14
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:04,779
- We're getting married tonight.
- We're getting married tonight.

15
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:18,509
You slept here?

16
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:21,947
- I'm awake. What?
- You slept here? I slept here.

17
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,534
- How? Wait... Who... What?
- I slept in the on-call room.

18
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,708
I could have been at
home in my own bed.

19
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,027
- Sorry.
- I have to work all day.

20
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:39,131
Then I have to be happy maid of
honor and get Meredith down the aisle.

21
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:42,134
I'm so tired.
Because I slept here.

22
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:44,786
'Cause you wanted to get your
freak on with roller skate girl.

23
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:48,473
I'm sorry. I was gonna, but...

24
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,627
We went to dinner
and... things didn't...

25
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:55,597
I wasn't in the mood. Had to
be here early, anyway, to run ER.

26
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:58,399
You're picking up
extra shifts in ER?

27
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:03,738
- So is Owen not here today?
- He's here. Crap, I'm late.

28
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,545
- Hey.
- Hey.

29
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:10,579
Big day! Biggest
day of your life!

30
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:14,082
Don't do that, the peppy
maid of honor thing. It's creepy.

31
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:18,069
Really? Good. Wait. Is this
the calm before the storm?

32
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,488
Need me to drug you?
Or shave your eyebrows

33
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:22,841
- to numb you into submission?
- I'm fine.

34
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,587
Not the biggest day of my life.

35
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,512
Biggest day of Izzie's life.
I'm excited about the marriage,

36
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:30,699
not some wedding. She's
the one who's gone Bridezilla.

37
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:32,851
Bridezilla!

38
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:35,586
You should see the
bridesmaids' dresses.

39
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:39,508
Oh! And the flowers! They're
being delivered at 5:00.

40
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,645
I had to pay extra to have them
decorate but Derek gave me his credit card,

41
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:46,915
told me to do what I had to
do so... It's gonna be perfect.

42
00:02:47,017 --> 00:02:49,034
- How's her pressure?
- Within normal.

43
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:51,202
And her incision site?

44
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,538
As expected, two
weeks after surgery.

45
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,390
She got off the IL-2 hours
ago. She could still have...

46
00:02:56,493 --> 00:03:01,013
Her mets are gone. Her blood
pressure's fine. Her incision doesn't hurt.

47
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:03,348
She's doing well.

48
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,884
It's wedding day! And I'm going.

49
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:09,104
I'm a bridesmaid. I'm
going. Right, Bailey?

50
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:12,291
- I said you could go.
- Wedding day!

51
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,526
Up top, Alex!

52
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,361
I'll check on you later.

53
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,798
Don't leave me hanging,
Bailey. Wedding day!

54
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,001
Wedding day...

55
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,165
You did that 'cause
I have cancer.

56
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:27,439
- You didn't mean it.
- True.

57
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:40,719
My hair is starting to fall out.

58
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,653
You still look good.

59
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:48,961
I know what this means.

60
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:52,997
- You being here.
- I'm sorry.

61
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,767
I'm still going to the wedding.

62
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,821
- How's Izzie?
- Good.

63
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:08,480
BP stable? If she's hypotensive
she shouldn't go to the wedding.

64
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,848
- Let me worry about Izzie.
- All right.

65
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,617
Anything for us? Anything good?

66
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,752
Nope. It's slow.

67
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,531
You don't say it's a
slow day in the pit.

68
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,673
Never say it's sl...

69
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:20,292
- You just jinxed us.
- It's a day and it's slow.

70
00:04:20,377 --> 00:04:22,476
That phone starts
ringing, you're gonna

71
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:25,107
- wish you hadn't said that.
- Not gonna ring. It's a slow day.

72
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,187
Go for Seattle Grace Emergency.

73
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:39,544
- I'll get the trauma gowns.
- Crap, crap, crap... Incoming!

74
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,133
How's it going with your shrink?

75
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:53,858
Uh... I'm doing
better. Inch by inch.

76
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:58,363
Progress is slow.

77
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:09,291
It was your ceiling
fan. Above your bed?

78
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:12,094
Blades spinning like
blades of a chopper.

79
00:05:12,196 --> 00:05:14,796
My shrink says
that was the trigger.

80
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,565
To me...

81
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:19,684
choking you.

82
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,688
Oh.

83
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,616
We should probably get going.

84
00:05:34,718 --> 00:05:39,037
David Simons, 22, in the driver's
seat when his car got crushed by a semi.

85
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,473
Truck blew a tire and
jack-knifed across traffic.

86
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:44,893
- Bay One until
we get a trauma room.
- Injuries?

87
00:05:44,995 --> 00:05:48,029
Chest contusions. Otherwise
vital signs were stable.

88
00:05:48,132 --> 00:05:51,499
- We can't be late.
- Ready? One, two, three...

89
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,985
- Late for what?
- Graduation.

90
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:57,172
Becca Wells, 21-year-old,
back seat. Vitals stable.

91
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,358
- Some shortness of breath.
- Bay Two for now.

92
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,594
- Gonna be so late.
- David, that you?

93
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,730
Becca? Are you OK?

94
00:06:05,816 --> 00:06:09,801
- I think so. I don't know.
- One, two, three.

95
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:12,553
I'm talking. Can't be
too bad if I'm talking.

96
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:19,026
22 year-old passenger, tenderness
above pelvis and unstable BP...

97
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,345
Bay Five.

98
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:22,614
Is my girlfriend here?
She was in the back seat.

99
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,482
- Jordan?
- Becca?

100
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,968
Have you seen Dana?
You were sitting next to her.

101
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,137
Can you check our friends?
Dana, Michelle, Pete?

102
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:31,623
Eight piled into the SUV?

103
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,542
- Are they all this bad?
- These are the healthy ones.

104
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:39,247
OK. I need beds. And blood and
interns. And Owen Hunt. Where's Hunt?

105
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:43,451
V-tach! BP's dropped out! Need
crash cart. I'm gonna cardiovert!

106
00:06:43,553 --> 00:06:45,770
David! What's wrong with him?

107
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,600
- Charge to 100! Clear.
- David!

108
00:06:47,624 --> 00:06:50,192
- What's wrong with David?
- Have to save him.

109
00:06:50,294 --> 00:06:53,794
You can't let him die! We're
supposed to be graduating.

110
00:06:53,897 --> 00:06:57,966
- Charge to 200! Clear!
- This is the biggest day
of our lives.

111
00:06:58,068 --> 00:06:59,901
Where in the hell is Hunt?

112
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,992
Hunt, thank God. Trauma
One through Three.

113
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,194
What do we got?

114
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:13,698
Becca Wells. Respiratory
rate up 20, but vital signs stable.

115
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,150
Is David OK? He has to graduate.

116
00:07:16,252 --> 00:07:18,520
He's the first in his
family to go to college.

117
00:07:18,622 --> 00:07:21,172
Don't worry about
your friends right now.

118
00:07:21,258 --> 00:07:24,159
No hemothorax or
pneumothorax. In line for CT.

119
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,545
Gonna get a few
X-rays, get a better idea.

120
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:29,280
You should rest. Your
body's in serious shock.

121
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,465
I have a speech to give.

122
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:35,219
I'm supposed to...
I'm the valedictorian.

123
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:39,374
All I've ever done is
school. It's all I've ever done.

124
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:43,245
I haven't done anything else.

125
00:07:44,781 --> 00:07:48,366
Until today. Today's the day
that my life is supposed to start.

126
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:52,370
Which is why I'd
really like to live. OK?

127
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,056
- Let me know
the results of the CT.
- OK.

128
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,913
I haven't seen Dana
yet, my girlfriend.

129
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:06,184
- She was in the backseat...
- Hang blood and push fluids.

130
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:10,021
She was singing to the radio.
She never knows the words.

131
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,857
I turned around to tell her
and then... she wasn't there.

132
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,643
Calm down so we can treat
you. Very serious injuries.

133
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,123
She was not in the car anymore!

134
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:19,697
I promise I will check for you.

135
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,515
You need to stay still for me.

136
00:08:21,618 --> 00:08:24,002
- She's wearing a pink sweater.
- OK.

137
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:27,622
Keep working. Try to get his
pressure up before you move him.

138
00:08:31,028 --> 00:08:34,296
Systolic's stabilizing, but
still multiple arrhythmias.

139
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:36,030
Thinking cardiac contusions.

140
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:40,068
- I'm about to use a chest tube.
- You got this, O'Malley.

141
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:42,537
- I've got blood.
- Put it in the rapid infuser.

142
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:45,190
Are my friends here?
Did you see Pete?

143
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:48,292
- Which one's Pete?
- He's wearing red sneakers.

144
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:51,946
And Michelle, she dyed
her hair blue for graduation.

145
00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:56,634
- Did you see her? Is she OK?
- I'll find them.

146
00:08:56,719 --> 00:09:00,472
- My whole family is coming.
- I know. It's a big day.

147
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:04,442
For them. Today is for them.

148
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,180
V-fib! He's coding!
Get the paddles!

149
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,938
Page me?

150
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,240
Yes. You get the
check for the caterers?

151
00:09:19,343 --> 00:09:21,075
- And cash tips for the waiters?
- Yes.

152
00:09:21,178 --> 00:09:24,062
- Did you write your vows?
- Not yet. I will.

153
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,864
You have to write your vows.

154
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:29,400
What you say this day, it's
important. She'll remember it for life.

155
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,770
If you paged me to
talk about the wedding...

156
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:33,638
That's not why I paged you.

157
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,575
I have a craniotomy to get to.

158
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:42,597
He's back. Denny. He's back.

159
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,014
I'll page Dr. Bailey
and we'll...

160
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:50,805
Order an MRI. I know the drill.

161
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,609
You wanted to see me, chief?

162
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,935
Derek was supposed to do this,
but he got pulled into something.

163
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,604
- I said I'd give it to you.
- What?

164
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:10,708
Your wedding present. Not from
me, from Derek. I have to oversee it.

165
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,905
I was supposed to
get him a present?

166
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:16,998
This is why weddings are stupid.
Our life together should be the present.

167
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,451
Not some stupid...
Whatever it is, I don't want it.

168
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:24,422
Tell Derek to take
it back. I'll tell him.

169
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:27,608
- He got you a colon.
- What?

170
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,177
A colon.

171
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,279
It's non-refundable, inflamed,

172
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,398
it's about to go under
anesthesia in OR 2.

173
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,368
You really wanna
say you don't want it?

174
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,353
A solo surgery?

175
00:10:41,258 --> 00:10:42,907
Happy Wedding Day.

176
00:10:44,694 --> 00:10:47,028
- Yes or no?
- Hey.

177
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,530
I don't need a maybe.
I need a yes or no.

178
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:53,250
OK. I'll be right here, waiting.

179
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:58,123
You think Shepherd and Grey
are gonna last? Like 50 years last?

180
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:01,242
A semi crashed into a
bunch of college kids.

181
00:11:01,344 --> 00:11:04,178
On the day I decided to
take an extra shift in the ER.

182
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,231
Great, thank you.

183
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:10,451
There's burns, digit amputations,
nasty facial lacerations.

184
00:11:10,553 --> 00:11:12,754
- Don't go anywhere. OK?
- Relax.

185
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:15,422
- Promise?
- You're handling this.

186
00:11:15,524 --> 00:11:17,358
I am handling it.

187
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,528
You can't put him here.
Doctors need access!

188
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,784
What went wrong last night?

189
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,619
Kinda busy here, Arizona.

190
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:32,173
I have four surgeries and a
kid on life support. I'm busy too.

191
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:35,860
- What went wrong?
- Not any better. In the hall!

192
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,629
We went out. To a
four star restaurant.

193
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:41,699
Best in Seattle. Supposed
to be fun. Romantic.

194
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,836
But you order a salad when
they make delicious French food.

195
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:47,605
You picked at it, barely
spoke and then bolted.

196
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,102
What went wrong?
Did I do something?

197
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,745
I wasn't feeling it. I
was exhausted. Sorry.

198
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:57,916
Hey! I said the hall! The hall!

199
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:02,444
Fill me in, O'Malley.

200
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:04,883
Put in the chest tube,
but there was no blood.

201
00:12:04,907 --> 00:12:06,658
Tried another, but
there's no pulse.

202
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,710
- How long's he been down?
- Twenty minutes.

203
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,862
- Open his chest...
- He's gone.

204
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:14,849
- He's supposed to graduate...
- O'Malley, let it go. He's gone.

205
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:18,753
You can't save him. Move
on to save the people you can.

206
00:12:18,855 --> 00:12:21,139
There's more trauma coming in.

207
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:25,659
- O'Malley. Now! Move!
- Call it, Grey.

208
00:12:28,398 --> 00:12:30,964
Time of death, 9:24.

209
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:44,712
It could be anything. Could
be scar tissue. Wait and see.

210
00:12:44,814 --> 00:12:47,564
- It's a tumor.
- You don't know that.

211
00:12:48,651 --> 00:12:51,485
Denny Duquette is
standing behind you.

212
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:55,306
It's a tumor. Right, Denny?

213
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:59,310
Yeah. It's good to
see you, Dr. Bailey.

214
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:04,065
You can't see him. Because you
don't have a tumor. But he says hi.

215
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,800
Tell Denny Duquette
I said, "Go home."

216
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:18,996
- It's a tumor.
- Wait and see.

217
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:26,471
I'm sorry, I'm crying
more than usual.

218
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,807
You said it's shock, is that it?

219
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,242
Yeah. Also the morphine.

220
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,297
I should've slept with David.

221
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,266
I thought about it,

222
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:42,570
but he was sweet and funny...

223
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:46,523
I would've fallen
in love with him.

224
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:50,211
And I didn't want a
relationship till after school.

225
00:13:50,313 --> 00:13:54,532
I don't like to do
things halfway.

226
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:59,403
I was doing school. And
then I was gonna do life.

227
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:03,908
And now... David's dead.

228
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,713
- David's dead.
- How's the CT, Karev?

229
00:14:08,798 --> 00:14:12,800
Stomach herniating into her hemithorax
from a huge lac in her diaphragm.

230
00:14:12,902 --> 00:14:17,688
OK. Becca, we're taking
you to surgery soon.

231
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:26,797
I should have had sex with
David when I had the chance.

232
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,287
Dana... Is she OK?

233
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:36,306
The paramedics
haven't brought her in yet,

234
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:41,045
but as soon they do, I'll let you know.
Do you have family we can contact?

235
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,414
They're in Argentina.

236
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:46,617
Supposed to fly there tomorrow.

237
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,519
It's D-Day.

238
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:52,206
- It's what?
- That's what Dana calls it.

239
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,961
Parents don't have the money
to let me stay. I have to go back.

240
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,814
Both knew D-Day was coming.

241
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,551
Tried to break up with
her to make it easier.

242
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:07,921
I'd switch classes every semester
so we didn't have any together...

243
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:14,195
but it didn't matter.
I couldn't stay away.

244
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:19,067
When you love
someone... Love is love.

245
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,821
Doesn't matter that you're
not supposed to be together.

246
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,958
How's he doing?

247
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,578
He's starting to stabilize.

248
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,847
Good. Looks like
he's ready for CT.

249
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:35,099
I think...

250
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:38,185
maybe she got out in time.

251
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:41,321
Maybe she's not hurt that bad.

252
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,599
Because when I turned around...

253
00:15:45,328 --> 00:15:47,761
she wasn't there.

254
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,798
She was not there anymore.

255
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,441
OK, X-ray's really
backed up, but...

256
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,393
- That's Pete.
- What?

257
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:05,246
David's friend. Pete.
The red sneakers.

258
00:16:05,348 --> 00:16:08,666
Help me. He's bleeding through
the dressing on the chest wound.

259
00:16:10,453 --> 00:16:12,520
Pulse is 220!

260
00:16:15,424 --> 00:16:19,377
Pericardial effusion. Get me
a syringe and a spinal needle.

261
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,362
I'm going in through the wound.

262
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:27,234
I need another syringe. Now.

263
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:30,016
- There's too much blood.
- Keep syringes coming.

264
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:33,207
Give me a 60cc this time.

265
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,661
- Asystole. He's flat-lining.
- Get the cardio board.

266
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:39,696
Just keep holding pressure.

267
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,867
Starting compressions on
my count. One, two, three.

268
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:51,675
- George...
- Keep putting pressure.

269
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,561
I'm not losing another one.

270
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,820
Thank you.

271
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:05,389
You're scrubbing in? I
thought I was doing this solo.

272
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,774
You are.

273
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:09,626
Why aren't you sitting
in a corner, reading?

274
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:12,496
It's a big day, Meredith.
Taking precautions.

275
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,299
Afraid I'm gonna kill the
patient on my wedding day?

276
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:18,385
It's a routine colectomy.
I'm not gonna kill him.

277
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:21,522
I know. You're gonna do
great. Pretend I'm not even here.

278
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:26,460
OK. OK. Scalpel.

279
00:17:28,164 --> 00:17:30,864
Great. Very nice.

280
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:33,901
What?

281
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:37,355
The way you asked for the scalpel.
You didn't mumble. You took charge.

282
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:40,324
Right off the bat. Loud
and clear. "Scalpel."

283
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,677
It was good. Very impressive.

284
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:44,945
Great.

285
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:50,017
I'm gonna get started now, so...

286
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:54,238
Of course. You won't
even know I'm here.

287
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,682
- There we go.
- Thanks.

288
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,185
I'll toast to the fact
they found each other.

289
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:10,521
Doesn't bring up the future,
about whether they'll make it.

290
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,490
- It's good, right?
- Mm-hm.

291
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,991
You said you were tired.

292
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,521
You can't be that exhausted if
you're working on your day off.

293
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:19,463
- I rallied.
- You rallied?

294
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,059
- Yeah.
- You're lying.

295
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,634
No, I love the ER. Can
you hold, please? Thanks.

296
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,105
- You love the ER?
- Can't get enough of it. It's fun.

297
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:36,129
- You should tell her.
- Yeah... Suck it, Mark.

298
00:18:36,232 --> 00:18:39,233
Hey! We need more
blood in Trauma Two. Go!

299
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:43,387
Dr. Hunt, I just lost another one.
My patients are dying. Pull me.

300
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,556
That's for me to decide.
There's an ambulance coming.

301
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,293
- I'm in over my head.
- Walk away, O'Malley!

302
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,331
That's Michelle. She dyed
her hair for graduation.

303
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:00,454
Look.

304
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,073
I'm looking, I
don't see anything.

305
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:05,893
Because there's nothing
there. Scan's clean.

306
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:07,145
I told you.

307
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:10,515
Then why is Denny back?
The man's a hallucination.

308
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:16,370
- There has to be
something there.
- Izzie, if it's clear, then...

309
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,718
I want to go to this wedding.

310
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:24,378
I want to watch the bride walk down
the aisle. I want to hear the vows.

311
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,247
I want to catch the bouquet.

312
00:19:26,349 --> 00:19:28,882
I planned this wedding
down to the last detail,

313
00:19:28,984 --> 00:19:33,737
it's the perfect wedding.
This wedding is perfect.

314
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:38,225
You know how much
I wanna be there.

315
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:40,560
So why would I tell
you about Denny?

316
00:19:40,663 --> 00:19:44,231
Today of all days?
Why wouldn't I just wait?

317
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:48,635
Denny is back. That
means something is there.

318
00:19:48,737 --> 00:19:51,455
It's not like we can
just map the brain

319
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:54,641
for hallucinations the
way we do with seizures.

320
00:19:54,743 --> 00:19:56,777
What are hallucinations?

321
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:59,479
Hallucinations are
neurons firing in the brain.

322
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:02,082
- Exactly.
- Why?

323
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:04,985
It's never been done
before, but if we can somehow

324
00:20:05,087 --> 00:20:07,521
induce your hallucination,

325
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,324
there's a chance we
could pick it up on an EEG.

326
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:14,044
We could pinpoint the part of
the brain that's hallucinating.

327
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:18,115
- Trauma One's open.
- What do we have?

328
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,886
Had a pulse, but we haven't been
able to get one for over 30 minutes.

329
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:25,222
I'm pretty sure we left half
her blood on the side of road.

330
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:27,791
She's DOA. I just
need you to call it.

331
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,861
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

332
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:34,081
Crap. Pink sweater.
That's Jordan's girlfriend.

333
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:36,117
- Move her out.
- Need you to call it.

334
00:20:36,219 --> 00:20:38,469
Dana! Dana, no!

335
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,054
Dana! No, I need to see her!

336
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:46,393
- Time of death, 10:45.
- Coding. Get a crash cart.

337
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:54,318
No. No, we are closed to trauma.

338
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,654
Because we have trauma
coming out of our butts!

339
00:20:56,756 --> 00:21:00,841
You have a nice day,
too! Oh, for the love of...

340
00:21:00,943 --> 00:21:02,392
So the ER is fun, but I'm not?

341
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:04,661
- Arizona...
- You can get enough of me?

342
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,764
Is that what you're saying?
Do you just want to end this?

343
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,783
There are women
lining up. I'm hot.

344
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:13,187
If you want out, you should
just say so. I can take it.

345
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:16,173
Maybe this was just
a fling. Maybe it's over.

346
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,392
Maybe it is.

347
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:29,153
Got some adhesions. Need to
dissect down to mobilize the sigmoid.

348
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:30,887
Bovie, please.

349
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,958
Mm... Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

350
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:37,306
Do you have something
you'd like to say?

351
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,463
No, no. You're doing fine.

352
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,168
How's the solo surgery
coming along, Grey?

353
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:48,155
I think it's going OK, but you
should probably ask the chief.

354
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,791
She's doing great.

355
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:54,561
Chose a cautery at one point
when I might have gone with scissors,

356
00:21:54,663 --> 00:21:55,980
but she made it work.

357
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,616
We'll be out of here in
plenty of time for the wedding.

358
00:21:58,718 --> 00:22:02,536
- Good. Then she won't
have any excuses.
- Excuse me?

359
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:05,305
This is the second time
I've been Derek's best man.

360
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:09,042
I have to come up with a toast,
offer words of wisdom. A lot of work.

361
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:13,230
I don't want to be his best man a
third time, if you know what I mean.

362
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,993
You came in here to threaten me?

363
00:22:15,017 --> 00:22:18,418
I'm his best man. That's my job.

364
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,337
Mm.

365
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,706
What now?

366
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,274
No, it's OK. It's fine.

367
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:27,494
Everything's fine, right? I
don't need to say anything.

368
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,829
Hmm.

369
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:35,152
So now what? I just...
try to have a hallucination?

370
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:37,304
- Yeah.
- OK.

371
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:42,092
Stevens, is it always
Denny? No one else?

372
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,861
- Yeah.
- Hm...

373
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:46,947
- What?
- Nothing. Um...

374
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:49,116
Makes sense. It's
the man you love...

375
00:22:49,218 --> 00:22:51,101
- He's not the man I love.
- He's not?

376
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:55,906
I mean, I love Denny, I
will always love Denny.

377
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:59,142
He means a lot to me.

378
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:04,331
But I think I hallucinate Denny because
I associate him with death and dying.

379
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:07,567
When I think about my future,
who I am and who I wanna be,

380
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:12,723
how I want to spend my life...
When you get that flutter in your chest.

381
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:16,943
Alex. Alex is the man I love.

382
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:18,846
Karev.

383
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,366
I love Alex Karev.

384
00:23:23,752 --> 00:23:27,604
So let's find this tumor
and get it out of me

385
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,773
so we can have
our perfect wedding,

386
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:33,777
a wedding not wasted on two
people who don't appreciate weddings.

387
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:37,515
- I can hear you.
- I mean for you to hear me.

388
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,480
What if I can't make him appear?

389
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:43,281
We'll wait until he appears.

390
00:23:43,305 --> 00:23:46,573
You have to be at the church
in two hours. It could be more.

391
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,426
- I'll be late.
- No! No being late.

392
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,596
I'll make him
appear. I can do this.

393
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,498
Come on, Denny...

394
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:09,330
How are my friends doing?

395
00:24:09,432 --> 00:24:12,999
Just tell me. I can take it.

396
00:24:14,587 --> 00:24:17,354
I mean, I can't but I can.

397
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:21,892
Did someone else die?

398
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:25,412
Why don't you tell me your
speech? Your graduation speech.

399
00:24:25,514 --> 00:24:26,846
I can take it.

400
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:29,866
Becca. Just... Just
give me your speech.

401
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:33,604
You worked hard on it. So
you should do it. Right now.

402
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,422
Come on.

403
00:24:38,126 --> 00:24:40,894
Today's the day my life begins.

404
00:24:42,998 --> 00:24:47,034
Today, I become a
citizen of the world.

405
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:52,505
Today, I become a grown-up.

406
00:24:52,608 --> 00:24:58,411
Today, I become accountable to
someone other than myself and my parents,

407
00:24:58,513 --> 00:25:01,247
accountable for
more than my grades.

408
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:05,452
Today I become
accountable to the world.

409
00:25:05,988 --> 00:25:08,055
To the future.

410
00:25:08,156 --> 00:25:11,825
To all the possibilities
that life has to offer.

411
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,027
Starting today...

412
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:18,331
- Come on, Denny. Come on.
- My job is to show up,

413
00:25:20,302 --> 00:25:25,739
wide-eyed and willing and ready.

414
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:30,294
For what, I don't know.

415
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:34,965
For anything. For everything.

416
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:37,434
Come on, Denny. Come on.

417
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:45,241
- Charge to 360.
- To take on life.

418
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:48,278
- Nice job, Meredith.
- To take on love.

419
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:55,152
All the times I didn't ask for you,
you were here. Now I'm asking. Please.

420
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:58,672
Please come to me
now. Please help me now.

421
00:25:58,774 --> 00:26:02,025
Come on, Denny.
You come to me now.

422
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:04,728
Denny...

423
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:12,353
To take on the
responsibility and possibility.

424
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:20,793
Today, my friends,
our lives begin.

425
00:26:20,896 --> 00:26:22,562
Time of death, 13:02.

426
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,398
And I, for one...

427
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,633
Denny.

428
00:26:27,302 --> 00:26:29,303
- Denny!
- There.

429
00:26:29,404 --> 00:26:32,856
- Can't wait.
- I'm here for you, Izzie.

430
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,459
It's right there.

431
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:55,863
These the results
from the tesla 7 MRI?

432
00:26:55,965 --> 00:26:59,733
Yeah. The part of the brain that
reacted during the hallucination?

433
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:03,170
It was the other temporal lobe.

434
00:27:03,272 --> 00:27:06,823
And that... That's the tumor?

435
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,760
Yeah. Tiny.

436
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:13,130
Too small to pick
up on a normal MRI.

437
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:16,800
If it's that small, how
are you going to get to it?

438
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,314
I wish there was
something I could do for her.

439
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:32,482
I wish I could.

440
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:38,372
I like Stevens. She's
one of the good ones.

441
00:27:38,473 --> 00:27:41,508
I wish there was
something I could do for her.

442
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:47,347
I...

443
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:52,202
I know something you can do.

444
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:59,243
I just want you to
know that I'm hurt.

445
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,178
I am hurt and I am angry.

446
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,147
I thought we had something,
we were going somewhere.

447
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:08,251
If you're just making the rounds of
girl surgeons then you ought to know...

448
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,204
- We went to a fancy restaurant!
- What?

449
00:28:11,306 --> 00:28:14,474
We went to a fancy restaurant.
The nicest restaurant in Seattle.

450
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:18,996
The salad I ordered...
The salad cost $26.95.

451
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:20,992
The wine you ordered
cost $125 a bottle.

452
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:26,269
I didn't even look at the entrees
because I was already out 75 bucks,

453
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,372
and I don't even like salad.

454
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:33,560
- Then the bill came and you...
- I paid.

455
00:28:33,662 --> 00:28:37,364
You know what I was doing
before they brought the check?

456
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,132
I was counting in my head,

457
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:43,553
trying to figure out how I was
going to buy food the rest of the week

458
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:46,740
if my half was $75, because I
don't have seventy-five dollars.

459
00:28:46,842 --> 00:28:52,079
Because my father disowned me and
cleared out my bank account. I'm broke!

460
00:28:52,181 --> 00:28:55,349
And I am exhausted, Arizona.

461
00:28:55,451 --> 00:28:58,585
I'm working in the ER
because I need the money.

462
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:05,225
Six people died on my
watch today and I'm fried.

463
00:29:08,263 --> 00:29:10,241
I wanted to stay in last night.

464
00:29:10,265 --> 00:29:15,051
I thought... I thought last
night would be the night. For us.

465
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,687
You know, our night.

466
00:29:17,772 --> 00:29:22,709
But you wanted to go to a fancy
restaurant, and I can't do that.

467
00:29:22,811 --> 00:29:26,646
- I can't.
- It's OK. It's OK. Hey.

468
00:29:26,748 --> 00:29:29,483
So we stay in.

469
00:29:29,585 --> 00:29:33,670
And we'll eat... sandwiches.

470
00:29:33,755 --> 00:29:36,656
You don't even like sandwiches.

471
00:29:36,758 --> 00:29:39,259
But I like the girl who
has the sandwiches.

472
00:29:41,629 --> 00:29:45,098
- OK?
- OK.

473
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:47,901
I don't like sandwiches
either. I like pizza.

474
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:51,288
I like pizza, too.

475
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,110
Meredith?

476
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:00,480
Yes, sir?

477
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:02,949
I've been reading
your mother's journals.

478
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,450
I wish she was here today.

479
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:08,571
I don't know how she would've
felt about me getting married.

480
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:12,642
No. Not for that. For this.
Your first solo surgery.

481
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:17,681
She probably would've said, with all the
mistakes, I'm lucky the patient's alive.

482
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:21,368
That's right. But I also know
she would have been thrilled.

483
00:30:21,469 --> 00:30:25,672
She wouldn't have been able to
tell you, but she would've been.

484
00:30:25,774 --> 00:30:27,658
Thank you, sir.

485
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:34,418
- Hey!
- Hey.

486
00:30:34,483 --> 00:30:36,566
You. Best wedding present ever.

487
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,619
- And you know why?
- No.

488
00:30:41,156 --> 00:30:42,923
Because I have to go home

489
00:30:43,024 --> 00:30:45,892
and put on a corset and
pantyhose and petticoat.

490
00:30:45,994 --> 00:30:48,995
And look like one of those
idiots on top of a wedding cake,

491
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,497
then I have to
walk down the aisle

492
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,449
and have everyone
staring at me, but it's OK.

493
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:57,553
Because I got to cut someone
open from start to finish.

494
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:58,938
I saved a life.

495
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,542
- Um...
- What?

496
00:31:02,644 --> 00:31:06,446
What do you say we
make this day even better?

497
00:31:12,021 --> 00:31:13,754
Good work today, O'Malley.

498
00:31:13,856 --> 00:31:16,573
Good work? They're
dead. All those kids.

499
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:20,193
- Not all of them.
- The one I didn't
touch was fine.

500
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,911
I was able to get to her.

501
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,882
And the reason I was, was
because I had you on my team.

502
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:28,518
You saved that girl
today as much as I did.

503
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,323
Trauma's a team sport, O'Malley.

504
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:36,810
You don't have to
be the hero, you just...

505
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:41,948
You just have to go
where you're needed.

506
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,825
Alex...

507
00:31:53,228 --> 00:31:55,407
Bailey says Shepherd
found another tumor.

508
00:31:55,431 --> 00:31:57,751
In Izzie's brain. Did you hear?

509
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:00,284
I heard. Alex...

510
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:03,787
He doesn't think he's
gonna get it out this time.

511
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,823
I think...

512
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:15,989
I think she's gonna die on me.

513
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,286
I think she's really gonna die.

514
00:32:25,427 --> 00:32:28,946
Aren't you supposed to be
getting ready for a wedding?

515
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:32,082
That's what I came
to talk to you about.

516
00:32:37,973 --> 00:32:41,307
Hi, I'm Dr. Grey. I'm gonna
take care of your central line.

517
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,909
OK.

518
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,370
You're crying.

519
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,222
You're breathing.

520
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,503
My shoes are, uh,
in the closet. Bailey?

521
00:33:10,606 --> 00:33:11,938
Shoes. Right.

522
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:16,526
You're supposed to be
helping me get ready.

523
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:20,997
I can still go, right? I mean,
the tumor's not going anywhere.

524
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:23,566
Yeah, you can go.

525
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,953
OK, well, we don't
wanna be late.

526
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,707
- Bailey?
- Uh... Here she comes.

527
00:33:32,127 --> 00:33:35,561
Mer! You're supposed
to be at the church!

528
00:33:35,663 --> 00:33:38,314
I'm going. I just came
to say, this isn't my dress.

529
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:40,867
Of course it's your
dress. It's perfect.

530
00:33:40,969 --> 00:33:44,804
- What are you talking about?
- This dress is not for me.

531
00:33:44,906 --> 00:33:47,406
I don't... What?

532
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:51,695
Oh, God, I knew you were gonna
freak out before the wedding.

533
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:56,349
Mer, Derek loves
you. Marriage is good.

534
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,684
Tell her, it's good.

535
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:02,055
She's saying it's not
her wedding dress.

536
00:34:05,694 --> 00:34:07,060
She's right.

537
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,596
The dress, it
isn't for Meredith.

538
00:34:43,598 --> 00:34:45,732
Oh, Mer...

539
00:34:46,702 --> 00:34:48,351
I don't...

540
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,871
I don't even know how to...

541
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,940
I...

542
00:34:55,644 --> 00:34:57,260
Thank you.

543
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:01,898
OK, so who's the maid
of honor? Me or Cristina?

544
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,950
Cristina.

545
00:35:04,052 --> 00:35:08,888
Alex... He needs a best man,
and he was asking for you.

546
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:13,443
- So what, I'm leftovers?
- You tried to save my life.

547
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:16,295
That makes you honorable.

Dearly beloved, we
are gathered here today

556
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:17,757
to celebrate the wedding
of Alexander Michael Karev

557
00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:20,760
and Isobel Catherine Stevens.

558
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:28,134
This is a sacred rite...

559
00:36:28,236 --> 00:36:31,304
an ancient rite.

560
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:35,875
As Isobel and Alex
prepare to join their lives,

561
00:36:35,978 --> 00:36:40,212
it is important to understand
that everyone present

562
00:36:40,315 --> 00:36:43,450
has played a part
in shaping their lives,

563
00:36:43,552 --> 00:36:48,455
and will continue to play a vital
role in their continuing future.

564
00:36:48,557 --> 00:36:53,426
And thus, we are here not only to
witness their vows to each other,

565
00:36:53,528 --> 00:36:57,530
but to bestow upon
them our blessing.

566
00:37:00,268 --> 00:37:03,420
And now, the couple
will read their vows.

567
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:05,205
We didn't write anything.

568
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:08,157
No. Wait, I have
something I want to say.

569
00:37:12,446 --> 00:37:15,081
Today's the day my life begins.

570
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:20,737
All my life I've been just
me. Just a smart mouth kid.

571
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:24,073
Today, I become a man.

572
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:28,578
Today, I become a husband.

573
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,415
Today, I become accountable
to someone other than myself.

574
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:38,121
Today I become accountable
to you. To our future.

575
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:41,992
To all the possibilities that
our marriage has to offer.

576
00:37:43,245 --> 00:37:47,830
Together, no matter
what happens, I'll be ready.

577
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,769
For anything. For everything.

578
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:57,840
To take on life.
To take on love.

579
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:01,978
To take on possibility
and responsibility.

580
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:06,349
Today, Izzie Stevens,
our life together begins.

581
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,534
And I, for one, can't wait.

582
00:38:08,636 --> 00:38:10,770
I love you.

583
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:15,441
- Not yet.
- Hurry up.

584
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:19,528
By the power vested in me by
God and the state of Washington,

585
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,249
I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

586
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:25,168

00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,854
It's just gonna
keep falling out.

593
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:56,643
We'll shave it off. I bet
you look good bald. OK?

594
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:06,770
Hey.

595
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,507

00:40:58,773 --> 00:41:01,840
<i>The day you meet your soul mate.</i>

603
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:09,415
The day you realize
there's not enough time...

604
00:41:10,485 --> 00:41:14,320
because you
want to live forever.

605
00:41:14,422 --> 00:41:17,090
Those are the biggest days.

606
00:41:18,426 --> 00:41:20,659
The perfect days.

607
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:25,498
You know?

608
00:41:26,501 --> 00:41:30,236
I'll bet you made
a beautiful bride.

609
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:33,656
It was a beautiful day.

610
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,826
You put the scarf on.

611
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:41,397
I told you, you don't need it.
You look gorgeous without it.

612
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,250
He's right.

613
00:41:45,887 --> 00:41:47,153
Go away now.

614
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:50,807
Go away, I want to be alone...

615
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:53,626
with my husband.

616
00:42:13,681 --> 00:42:15,064
My wife is hot.
