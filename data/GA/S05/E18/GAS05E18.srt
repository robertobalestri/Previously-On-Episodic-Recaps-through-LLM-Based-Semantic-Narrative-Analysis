1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:05,670
<i>Surgeons aren't known
for being warm and cuddly.</i>

2
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:08,040
<i>They're arrogant, impatient,</i>

3
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:11,176
<i>- mean, as often as not.</i>
<i>- </i> Go with straight-up chemo

4
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:15,314
and immunotherapy. Survival rates
are low, but there's been a lot of success

5
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:19,117
with mestastasectomies. We
could probably cut this thing out.

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,203
<i>You'd think they wouldn't have
friends. Who could stand them?</i>

7
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:25,607
- What are you hiding?
- Nothing. It's just
work stuff.

8
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:28,610
- What is that? A cool surgery?
- No, it's nothing. It's nothing.

9
00:00:28,712 --> 00:00:32,981
Whatever it is, they'll pick me. I flew
solo. You're still on training wheels.

10
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:38,753
- Sure you still
don't wanna tell him?
- Yes, I'm sure.

11
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:42,408
OK. Look, I researched a ton
of information. Read all of this

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,221
- before you see
the oncologist.
- When?

13
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:47,979
I called Dr. Golding. He
gave me a referral to Swender.

14
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,798
- I'm gonna try
and get you in today.
- Shh!

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,196
What are you doing
here? I told you I was fine.

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,132
- You are so not fine.
- I'd be fine if
I knew Derek was fine.

17
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,957
You still haven't heard
from him? No word?

18
00:01:03,681 --> 00:01:06,165
Izzie, don't you think you
should call in sick today?

19
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:08,827
- What? Why?
- Because this is
a lot of reading,

20
00:01:08,886 --> 00:01:12,370
- and you're sick.
- You coming? Big surgery today.

21
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:14,589
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Izzie, just...

22
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:19,194
<i>But surgeons are
like a bad cold:</i>

23
00:01:19,296 --> 00:01:21,713
<i>Nasty, but persistent.</i>

24
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,483
Uh, Chief, I need
to ask you about...

25
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,268
Sloan, have you
heard from Derek?

26
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:30,205
No.

27
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:32,841
I'm sorry. You were
saying? Oh, Meredith.

28
00:01:32,943 --> 00:01:36,929
No, I don't know how he is. I've
heard nothing. Nothing today, nothing

29
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:41,516
yesterday, nothing the day before.
And no, I will not go back out there.

30
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,973
Hey, who moved my
surgery? Chief? Chief?

31
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:50,108
Don't. Just don't. He's a wreck.

32
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,227
He's disintegrating
before our eyes.

33
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:57,465
- That's why men
die earlier than women.
- Mm. The board's a mess.

34
00:01:57,567 --> 00:02:00,569
He can't lose Shepherd. I'd
go talk some sense into him,

35
00:02:00,671 --> 00:02:04,005
- but I've got
too much on my plate.
- Tried calling?

36
00:02:04,107 --> 00:02:05,023
About 100 times.

37
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,625
Mm.

38
00:02:11,247 --> 00:02:13,682
No. Oh, you...

39
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:16,963
You want me to go to the
woods? No. I don't do woods.

40
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:20,467
The woods are dirty and
there are many, many bugs.

41
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,904
What am I gonna
say? I barely know him.

42
00:02:23,928 --> 00:02:27,846
You don't have to know him. You're
surgeons, been through the same war.

43
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:31,533
Just remind him we've all
been there, we all came back.

44
00:02:32,636 --> 00:02:35,670
You're kind of a
bully, you know that?

45
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:37,906
I wouldn't do it if it
didn't work so well.

46
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:42,327
This is one of the biggest surgeries
you may get near so pay attention.

47
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:45,731
The patient is a 38-year-old male
hit by a drunk driver 12 years ago.

48
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,167
- He suffered
severe facial trauma.
- No nose, no lips.

49
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:53,037
That's why we dubbed him Blowhole.
He's had nine reconstructive surgeries,

50
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,902
none of which have brought
back full form or function.

51
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,310
This surgery has only
been done four times.

52
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:01,913
All candidates have to undergo
extensive psychological testing

53
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,650
to determine whether they
can handle the process.

54
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:09,037
Psychological components aside, this
has a chance of rejection or infection.

55
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:12,874
He'll be on life-long anti-rejection
drugs which put him at risk

56
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:17,178
for lymphoma, diabetes,
hypertension, renal failure.

57
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,481
- I hear they call
the dude Blowhole.
- What did you just say?

58
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,784
Nothing. I just heard
he had a nickname.

59
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:26,038
Don't talk anymore. Ever.

60
00:03:33,831 --> 00:03:38,283
- Holy crap! Blowhole is right.
- What'd I tell you?

61
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,285
<i>Surgeons:</i>

62
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:44,272
<i>nasty, aggressive, unstoppable.</i>

63
00:03:44,374 --> 00:03:48,210
<i>Just the kind of people you want on
your side when you're really screwed.</i>

64
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,346
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Mr. David Young.

65
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,283
Today he'll be receiving
a face transplant.

66
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:03,408
Dr. Hunt and his team'll be
recovering the donor graft.

67
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,394
We're replacing 70
percent of Mr. Young's face.

68
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:10,098
- You can see
the deficit here.
- Or here.

69
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,154
The donor recovery will include
his nose, left eye, lips, left zygoma.

70
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,791
Why will allotransplantation work
better than traditional techniques?

71
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:24,880
Aesthetic outcome allows re-enervation
of nerves, giving a better result.

72
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,882
Very good, Dr. Grey.

73
00:04:26,984 --> 00:04:29,467
We'll position the flap
over Mr. Young's face.

74
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,137
- How do we know we're clear?
- The graft turns pink.

75
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,840
Excellent.

76
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:39,761
- Dave, any questions for us?
- Has anyone seen the donor?

77
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:43,398
Yes, he's a match with your
age, skin tone and blood type.

78
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:48,770
- What does he look like?
- I think you'll be satisfied.

79
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,406
Who am I kidding?
It's a face, right?

80
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:55,143
If I end up anything above
a point and stare freak,

81
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:57,195
I'm gonna call it a success.

82
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,285
Karev, you're with me and the donor.
Usually we take them at the same time,

83
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:05,364
but donor's life
support is fading. Move.

84
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,824
- Thank you, sir.
- Stevens, Grey.

85
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:11,393
- Yes.
- No, the other Grey.

86
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:14,129
- Really? Great.
- Great.

87
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,347
You did an awesome job in there.

88
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:20,702
- Call me after
the pre-op labs come in.
- Dr. Sloan, only one resident?

89
00:05:20,804 --> 00:05:23,822
Wait for Bailey. There's
enough of a crowd.

90
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,376
- What the hell?
- Izzie, I don't think
you have time

91
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:30,873
- to scrub in.
- Don't worry. I can handle it.

92
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,982
- Awesome job.
- She probably
quizzed him in bed.

93
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:37,518
- She gets to work
on Blowhole...
- Shut your mouths!

94
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:43,508
Finish the chart. I'll be back.

95
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:50,482
O'Malley, Grey? I need
you on pre-ops and post-ops.

96
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,401
There's the biggest surgery
in the world happening.

97
00:05:53,503 --> 00:05:57,288
Yes. Half our attendings are involved,
which is why we need strong residents

98
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,857
on pre-ops and post-ops.
Yang, you're with me.

99
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,709
- Moving to the big leagues.
- What?

100
00:06:01,811 --> 00:06:03,331
- She gets a solo?
- Today?

101
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:06,147
Nice old lady with a
hernia, you're gonna fix it.

102
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:09,646
Congratulations. I know I
should seem more enthusiastic,

103
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,403
- but I'm not
that big a person.
- Don't worry about it.

104
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:16,441
Is it wrong to have
hatred in your heart?

105
00:06:17,861 --> 00:06:20,595
Good morning, Miss
Sulley. I'm Dr. Cristina Yang.

106
00:06:20,697 --> 00:06:23,731
- I'll perform
your hernia repair.
- Lovely to meet you.

107
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:28,269
- Have any questions
before we start?
- Yes. Hand me my purse.

108
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,217
My friends gave me
a bunch of questions,

109
00:06:31,241 --> 00:06:33,407
and I can't remember
any of them.

110
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:38,146
They're such worrywarts. They're
all off on a European tour without me.

111
00:06:38,248 --> 00:06:42,033
They threatened not to go when
this became a problem. I told 'em no.

112
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,820
No. We have been saving
up for this for two years.

113
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:48,757
I was able to get my deposit
back with a doctor's note.

114
00:06:53,196 --> 00:06:55,563
Cristina Yang. Yes?

115
00:06:56,432 --> 00:06:59,300
No. No, it has to be today.

116
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:04,605
It's stage four. She has to
see Dr. Swender, not a partner.

117
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:07,358
Um, I'm sorry, ma'am.

118
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,195
I will get to your questions
when I come to examine you. OK?

119
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:13,748
Referral is Golding? Golding.

120
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,312
A little early in the day
for that, don't you think?

121
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:31,165
- You sound like my mother.
- I met your mother. I liked her.

122
00:07:31,268 --> 00:07:33,835
- Who sent you, Richard?
- Uh, Bailey.

123
00:07:33,937 --> 00:07:35,870
Of course.

124
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:40,441
I'm sorry about your patient.
I know how hard it can be.

125
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:45,096
I had a patient a
couple of years ago...

126
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,133
Young guy, 50 maybe.

127
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:50,952
Simple knee replacement.
He was post-op, he was fine.

128
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:55,423
I told his wife she could get him lunch.
A simple knee replacement. Nothing.

129
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:58,493
He'd been getting short of
breath. I put him on blood thinners

130
00:07:58,595 --> 00:08:00,528
for a post-surgical PE.

131
00:08:00,631 --> 00:08:05,366
And... it wasn't until he was vomiting
up dark blood, looking me in the eye,

132
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:08,469
telling me that he was
dying that I figured it out.

133
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:11,973
That I was wrong. It wasn't a
PE. He was bleeding internally.

134
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:16,260
It wouldn't have been
fatal, but the blood thinners...

135
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:22,166
God, I will never forget
the look on his wife's face

136
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,936
when she came back with
that sandwich in her hand,

137
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,606
asking me why her husband
wasn't in his room anymore.

138
00:08:31,494 --> 00:08:33,594
How do you live with it?

139
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:36,297
Killing him.

140
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:40,802
Taking him from his wife.
How do you live with it?

141
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:48,493
- We call it malpractice...
- I know. I'm asking
when you get up,

142
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:51,796
how do you look at
yourself in the mirror?

143
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,099
Look, I'm not... I'm...

144
00:08:56,486 --> 00:08:58,153
I'm asking.

145
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,527
Can I get one of those?

146
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,730
Yeah.

147
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,620
It's the not knowing that
does it. Not knowing if he's OK,

148
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:19,457
not knowing if he's coming back.
Maybe I've just been dumped.

149
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,411
It's not knowing if I'm single that
makes me wanna throw up all day.

150
00:09:23,513 --> 00:09:26,580
- You are not listening
to me, are you?
- Uh, sorry.

151
00:09:26,683 --> 00:09:30,484
No, no, that's OK. I get it. You've
got solo surgery and GI Joe.

152
00:09:30,586 --> 00:09:33,171
It's a charmed life. You
don't have time for me.

153
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:36,313
I have not had GI Joe.
We've kissed a couple times.

154
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:39,488
It's like friends with
benefits... without the benefits.

155
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:43,231
- Still no sex.
- Mm-mmm. Not a charmed life.

156
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,851
Lab results from
the splenectomy.

157
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,158
- Do we ask?
- No.

158
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,541
'Cause he might tell us.

159
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,798
Can you imagine? This
guy's got a family, right?

160
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:06,605
Wife, kids? One day they'll see
his face on somebody else's body.

161
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,507
- It's kind of creepy, right?
- Mr. Young won't look exactly

162
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,477
like the donor. The underlying
facial structure of two people can be

163
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:17,082
- very different.
- A person's identity
is more than

164
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:20,368
skin and bone. His
expression, style, eyes.

165
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,972
The donor's family wouldn't
recognize this face on anyone else.

166
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:28,042
- Transplant surgeons are antsy.
- They're always antsy.

167
00:10:28,144 --> 00:10:31,090
They can't relax until they
got live tissue in their coolers.

168
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:33,565
I am making the
final dissection.

169
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:36,751
Karev, hold right of the temple

170
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:40,588
and gently lift.
Don't tear the flesh.

171
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,048
Awesome.

172
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:56,655
Tenderness around the incision
is normal. No signs of infection.

173
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:59,307
Could you redress that wound?

174
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,581
Megan, will you
please go to 20...

175
00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:10,051
Um, go to room 2214

176
00:11:10,153 --> 00:11:12,870
and just take out the drain.

177
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,273
When you're ready.

178
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,375
It seems personal,

179
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,627
we wouldn't ask if we
didn't need to know,

180
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:21,346
but have you passed gas yet?

181
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,468
Sorry.

182
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:33,707
We can't release you
until that happens. The gas.

183
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:37,662
I'm sorry. I'm trying to listen, but
are they supposed to look like that?

184
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:40,932
- Like what?
- The bleeding
and the shiner.

185
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,345
And that one looks
like she's suicidal.

186
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,064
They're supposed to be doctors?

187
00:11:45,088 --> 00:11:47,538
We're gonna reserve
judgment on that.

188
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,193
- Freak show.
- What the heck
do we do with them?

189
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,596
- Can we shove them in a locker?
- We should talk to them.

190
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:59,634
No. We're professionals.
That's clearly personal.

191
00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:02,437
Besides, we'll waste time,
never see the solo surgery

192
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:05,924
- or the face transplant.
- Oh, that's a good point.

193
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:09,860
- I guess we should
ignore it then.
- Yeah, just ignore it.

194
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:13,314
- It's the professional
thing to do.
- Professionally...

195
00:12:16,886 --> 00:12:19,553
It's important that you
take all the medications...

196
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:24,175
Risk of rejection and infection. I
know. You drilled it into my head

197
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,628
- a thousand times.
- Is your family here yet?

198
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,647
I ask because someone needs
to take care of you afterwards.

199
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,384
I don't have family, but my
friends are coming after the surgery.

200
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,604
I'm excited to meet them
and show them my new face.

201
00:12:36,706 --> 00:12:39,991
We met in an online chat
room for orchid lovers.

202
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,712
We've never actually
"met" met, so...

203
00:12:44,814 --> 00:12:47,726
Dave, after the surgery, this
device helps prevent lung problems

204
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,902
by exercising the muscles
you use to breathe.

205
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:54,055
- I'd like you
to practice on it now.
- Sit up straight.

206
00:12:54,157 --> 00:12:57,926
Take three easy breaths
and then blow into that.

207
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:01,128
- Hole.
- That's it!

208
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,949
Both of you, in the hall, now!
You really think that was OK?

209
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,685
- That was doctorly?!
- Find something else to do.

210
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,539
- What the hell's
going on with you?
- They made inappropriate jokes

211
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:14,409
at the expense of the
patient. Right in front of him.

212
00:13:14,511 --> 00:13:18,863
I have been trying to teach them,
and they were cruel and inappropriate.

213
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:22,633
OK, they were inappropriate. You
know what else is inappropriate?

214
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,501
This. You.

215
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:28,273
This case is my baby. I've
spent three years planning for it,

216
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,441
and you are not
about to piss all over it.

217
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:34,244
- You're off the case.
- No. He needs me
in there with him.

218
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,441
You can't leave
him alone with them.

219
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:38,482
You wanna be
there for his feelings,

220
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,019
you can be there before
and after the surgery,

221
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:44,305
but you're not coming in my
OR. Whatever's going on with you,

222
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,623
get it under control.

223
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:53,564
- I found them.
- What? Your questions
about the surgery?

224
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,000
One of my friends,
Phil Ferguson,

225
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:59,337
he's a retired surgeon. He
told me to ask you these.

226
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,606
I can't seem to find my glasses.
My friends should be here.

227
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,243
I put my glasses down
somewhere, they find them...

228
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:10,048
Will you finally be able to pick up your
grandkids? A question from a doctor?

229
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,450
No. No, my other friends
helped me with questions.

230
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:14,952
I added a few on my own.

231
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,338
Like, "Will it hurt?"

232
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,307
Will it... hurt?

233
00:14:19,409 --> 00:14:23,628
- You'll be anesthetized.
- Yes, I know that.

234
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:28,415
- I mean after. Will it hurt?
- You should expect
normal post-op pain.

235
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,871
Yes? Yes.

236
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:37,241
No, that is
fantastic. I'll take it.

237
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:41,345
Thank you so much. I'll get
in touch with her right away.

238
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,947
2:30. Anytime is fine.

239
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:47,318
So I've covered
22, 13, 19 and 33.

240
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:52,089
Yeah, OK. I've
got 2011 and 2007.

241
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:55,326
Mer, there is something
wrong with Izzie.

242
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:58,095
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

243
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,942
I know that there
is something wrong.

244
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:02,683
We're drowning in intern drama.

245
00:15:02,785 --> 00:15:04,952
We don't need
resident drama too.

246
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:08,940
If it's a problem, she'll tell
us. Until then, just ignore it.

247
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,530
I repeat, ignore it.

248
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:19,650
- What in God's name
is going on?
- A personal issue.

249
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,014
We are just trying to
give them their privacy.

250
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:26,340
Gee, you think for a second I wanted
to get involved with your intern drama?

251
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:29,877
- We were not this bad.
- Getting married in Vegas.

252
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:33,831
Shacking up with attendings. Cutting
LVAD wires. You don't have to like it,

253
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,067
- but you have to manage it.
- We've got it under control.

254
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,773
Wait! I love you, Megan!

255
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,761
Sir, are you OK?
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

256
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:57,288
Whatever it is the two of you
have going on, it stops now.

257
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:00,208
- I didn't mean to...
- Don't talk while
she's talking.

258
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:04,445
You are scaring the patients. You're
making this hospital look ridiculous.

259
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,998
- You're making us
look incompetent.
- Not a good idea.

260
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,319
Just stay away from each other. So
much as a tear or a glance at each other,

261
00:16:12,422 --> 00:16:14,462
- and it's over. No!
- I don't understand.

262
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:17,942
- Don't talk while I'm talking.
- That's what I was
trying to tell...

263
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:21,462
Now just get out! Go!

264
00:16:22,632 --> 00:16:24,532
Not together.

265
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:27,067
That felt good.

266
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:30,154
- You paged me, Dr. Bailey?
- Oh! Yes.

267
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,323
Um, finished your part
of the face transplant?

268
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:35,826
I cleared my schedule to watch
Sloan and Yang do surgery.

269
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,891
Whatever it is you need, I
hope it's not too time-consuming.

270
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,298
That all depends on how
fast you can drive and talk.

271
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:45,636
- I'm sorry?
- I need you to drive out
to the woods

272
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,005
and talk Derek Shepherd
into coming back here.

273
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:52,626
And I believe you also might run
into Callie Torres. With a flat tire.

274
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:55,946
Or a broken heel. Or an
axe-wielding serial killer.

275
00:16:56,048 --> 00:17:00,451
- You're serious?
- I sent Torres
after Shepherd,

276
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:03,771
and she's fallen off the grid.
Her phone goes to voicemail.

277
00:17:03,873 --> 00:17:07,809
I'm normally not a panicky person,
but I'm a fan of daytime television.

278
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:11,012
My crazy scenarios...
Never mind.

279
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:16,016
I need you to go get Torres and
Shepherd and bring them back here

280
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,001
before the chief
notices you're gone.

281
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:20,471
Shepherd's been gone all week...

282
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:25,576
Hunt! You survived a
war, you can do this.

283
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:28,830
I know I can do this.
I'm saying I don't want to.

284
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,789
People don't really say
"no" to you, do they?

285
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,259
Not when I say please.

286
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:44,111
I'm saying please!

287
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,848
OR is set,
transport's on its way.

288
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,185
- You ready?
- I've been ready
for 12 years.

289
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:54,655
You said you had friends
coming to take care of you?

290
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:58,275
- Yeah, after my surgery.
- They're coming now.

291
00:17:59,728 --> 00:18:00,994
Surprise!

292
00:18:02,098 --> 00:18:04,231
Hi. It's me, Sheena.

293
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,101
You can probably tell from
my Vanda roeblingiana.

294
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:11,138
I hope you're not mad
that we came early.

295
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,341
We thought we should be here
through it all. Make sure you knew...

296
00:18:14,443 --> 00:18:18,862
Get out. Get them out. They're
strangers. I don't want them in here.

297
00:18:18,948 --> 00:18:21,682
We're hardly strangers, Dave.

298
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:24,902
We chat every night,
all night, for years.

299
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,071
- We flew in...
- Get out! We've never met.

300
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:30,641
You don't know me,
anything about me. Get out!

301
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:33,360
Get them out! Get out. Get out!

302
00:18:33,462 --> 00:18:35,212
Get out!

303
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,326
Hey. Did you get my
page? I got the appointment.

304
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:51,729
It's in, like, 15 minutes.
How amazing am I?

305
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,198
Usually takes weeks to get
in. You look at the research?

306
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,651
- Seriously,
can I just eat?
- No.

307
00:18:57,753 --> 00:19:00,872
- I'm sorry. You don't have time.
- Time for what?

308
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:04,392
There's a... an enema.

309
00:19:04,494 --> 00:19:07,245
- Uh, Izzie's enema.
- Yes.

310
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:10,647
I was supposed to get an enema
today, but I decided it can wait.

311
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,934
- Talk about something else?
- We need to talk about it.

312
00:19:14,036 --> 00:19:18,004
You've been complaining
about being really backed up.

313
00:19:18,107 --> 00:19:20,808
- I got you an appointment.
- If you need an enema,

314
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:24,562
- you shouldn't have fries.
- You booked her for an enema?

315
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,782
You can't just say that you're
all backed up and just sit there.

316
00:19:27,884 --> 00:19:29,617
If you make the
decision to get an enema,

317
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:33,904
- you should get an enema.
- Maybe you're the one
that's backed up.

318
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,523
Solo surgery
panic? Tell you what.

319
00:19:36,626 --> 00:19:39,705
I'll scrub in. If you can't
handle it, I'll take over.

320
00:19:39,729 --> 00:19:42,980
I don't... OK. You know...

321
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:46,600
I'm just saying... enemas
can be a serious business.

322
00:19:46,702 --> 00:19:49,903
OK. Izzie, enema
is code for what?

323
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:54,991
- My enema, my business.
- Uh, fifteen minutes!

324
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:59,079
This is a really strange day.

325
00:20:00,249 --> 00:20:02,482
I was a second-year
resident. MVC rolls in.

326
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:06,620
Parents in the front seat. Three kids in
the back. Kids were OK. Mom and dad

327
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:10,758
a little banged up. Nothing terrible,
talking and laughing in the ER.

328
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,612
Turns out both parents
had massive internal injuries.

329
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:18,049
I operated on them
both that night. Hours.

330
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,416
Lost them both.

331
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,988
If I'd moved faster,
rushed them to CT,

332
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,740
known how bad off
they were sooner,

333
00:20:26,843 --> 00:20:30,611
but... I didn't. The
oldest kid was nine.

334
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:34,014
When I came out to
tell them about their dad,

335
00:20:34,116 --> 00:20:38,319
he was consoling the three- and
five-year-old about their mother.

336
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:41,471
I'll never get that image out of
my head. This nine-year-old boy

337
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:46,243
trying to hold these two little
ones, his arms just not big enough.

338
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:52,082
I don't know how I
came back the next day.

339
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,836
I think part of me never did.

340
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,491
I'm surprised you
didn't talk about Iraq.

341
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,259
I don't talk about Iraq.

342
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:05,596
What my point was, I kept...

343
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:08,415
You know, I... I went back.

344
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,417
I showed up. I...

345
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:13,236
I showed up for work, you know?

346
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:17,174
You go dead inside...

347
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,504
You go dead inside
because if you felt it,

348
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:23,897
if you let yourself feel that,
no way you're going back.

349
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:25,279
No way.

350
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,421
- You blew it off?
- Cristina, please.

351
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:52,042
I called every favor I had in
this hospital and then some.

352
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,945
Swender's the best surgical
oncologist. Why didn't you go?

353
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:58,349
- Why do you care so much?
- Why don't you?

354
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,884
I'm working really hard on
this. The least you could do...

355
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:05,639
They were calling the guy
Blowhole. Not just the interns, Alex.

356
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,309
What are they gonna call
me when I'm the patient?

357
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:11,645
- Swiss Cheese for Brains?
- No, that's awkward and long.

358
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,998
- Blowhole's pithy.
- I'm not gonna be
a piece of meat

359
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,346
while you all fight over
who gets to slice me up

360
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:21,038
- and then laugh
while you do it.
- OK, this right here,

361
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,275
this, um, is an emotional
thing you're having,

362
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:27,961
which is why you should
tell Meredith, or George...

363
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:31,098
I'm not telling
anybody, so just drop it!

364
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,934
No! You're not
dumping this on me.

365
00:22:34,036 --> 00:22:35,247
You're not dying in my arms.

366
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,311
So either you
tell them or I will.

367
00:22:37,372 --> 00:22:42,276
I don't even know
if I want treatment.

368
00:22:42,377 --> 00:22:45,462
I know too much. I know
how violent surgery can be.

369
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:48,498
They're gonna cut into my
brain, slice open my abdomen

370
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:50,868
and pull my organs
out. And for what?

371
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:55,205
Surgery fails all the time. Derek
Shepherd is in the freaking woods

372
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,757
because we fail all the time!

373
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,228
Even if they do everything, I have
a five percent chance of survival.

374
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,497
Five percent.

375
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:08,085
Why would I put myself through
hell, run poison through my veins,

376
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:11,622
irradiate my brain if it's
not gonna work anyway?

377
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:18,361
Why did you tell me then?

378
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:22,432
If you don't want my help and
you're not gonna do anything about it,

379
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,401
why did you tell me?

380
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:29,222
Keep your mouth shut.
Forget I told you anything.

381
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,641
Izzie!

382
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:41,352
You need to call
them back, Dave.

383
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:45,356
You're my surgeon,
right? You're not my shrink.

384
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:49,843
- So why don't you
just do your job?
- I can't do my job anymore.

385
00:23:49,945 --> 00:23:53,446
It took us three years to find the
right candidate, and part of you being

386
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:56,327
the right candidate is having
a support system post-op.

387
00:23:56,351 --> 00:24:00,103
You cannot do this alone. The
ethics board will not allow me

388
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:04,424
to let you do it alone.
You need your friends.

389
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,410
You see that orchid?

390
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:12,483
It's ugly. To anyone who doesn't
know orchids, it's dark and droopy

391
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:15,919
and it's ugly,
unless you know it.

392
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:20,941
Unless you understand how it
adapted, what it's lived through,

393
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,611
and how strong it
had to be to survive.

394
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:28,031
A photo of that orchid, that's the
only picture my friends had seen of me.

395
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:32,253
That's how I wanted them to
picture me until I had my new face.

396
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:37,090
People look away from me.

397
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:42,829
Kids cry and adults cringe.

398
00:24:42,931 --> 00:24:45,415
They look away.

399
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,603
I didn't want my friends...

400
00:24:50,705 --> 00:24:55,409
I didn't want them to ever
have any reason to look away.

401
00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:58,178
They didn't look away.

402
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,433
Your friends, they didn't
cringe. Not one of them.

403
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:05,402
They didn't look away. You
looked away, didn't trust them.

404
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,104
You looked away from them.

405
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:11,091
Let us call them. They
flew all the way here.

406
00:25:11,193 --> 00:25:14,711
Just let us call them
back. It's not too late.

407
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:17,431
If you want this surgery, Dave,

408
00:25:17,533 --> 00:25:20,316
you gotta give them a chance.

409
00:25:24,506 --> 00:25:26,073
Uh, Chief?

410
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:30,293
- Dr. Bailey?
- How's your mood?

411
00:25:31,647 --> 00:25:35,949
Eager. Anxious. I'm excited
about Sloan's face transplant.

412
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:39,269
I'm a little concerned
about Derek, but all in all...

413
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:42,372
- Do I look
like a therapist?
- You asked.

414
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:49,162
I've lost Hunt and Torres. I
sent them to get Shepherd,

415
00:25:49,264 --> 00:25:51,176
and I never heard
from them again.

416
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,801
I was trying to solve the
Shepherd situation for you, sir.

417
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:57,470
But it appears I've somehow
made it three times worse.

418
00:25:57,572 --> 00:26:01,341
So I'm telling you, and
my next move, I believe,

419
00:26:01,443 --> 00:26:03,255
is that I'm gonna
call the police.

420
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,847
Because I'm half
convinced they're all dead.

421
00:26:06,949 --> 00:26:11,185
On a spit with a one-armed man
turning them into shish kebabs, sir.

422
00:26:11,287 --> 00:26:14,771
It's my mind, it
just goes there.

423
00:26:14,857 --> 00:26:17,207
- Don't beat yourself up.
- It's a hard decision.

424
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,676
Yeah, you've been with
Pierce for the whole year.

425
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,389
Just listen to your heart...

426
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,414
- Why are they starting late?
- A problem with the recipient.

427
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:28,001
They've only got a few hours
left for that face to be viable.

428
00:26:28,103 --> 00:26:30,687
Sloan must be
freaking out, right?

429
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:37,695
- Home wrecker.
- What did you say? What did you say?

430
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:41,315
- Guys!
- You two, get out. You, come with me.

431
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:44,484
- Come on.
- Hey, buddy.

432
00:26:44,586 --> 00:26:47,437
You need to start talking.
You need to start talking now.

433
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:51,224
- I really can't. Talk to Steve.
- You gotta start talking, dude,

434
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:55,528
because any second, they're gonna
start that face transplant surgery.

435
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,225
- Her friend...
- Best friend.

436
00:26:57,249 --> 00:27:01,418
Is gonna have her very
first solo surgery, and so...

437
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,588
- we have little
patience right now.
- It's not my place...

438
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,039
OK!

439
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:10,694
You are gonna tell me
everything that's going on.

440
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,716
Or else every time I have a
rectal exam or an infected abscess,

441
00:27:13,782 --> 00:27:16,466
it's gonna have your
name on it. Every time!

442
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:25,759
Megan was with
Pierce. But they broke up.

443
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:29,095
While they were broken
up, she slept with Steve.

444
00:27:29,197 --> 00:27:33,233
Then she got back together with
Pierce. But Steve sent her an e-mail

445
00:27:33,335 --> 00:27:36,236
about how they slept together.
Instead of e-mailing her,

446
00:27:36,338 --> 00:27:38,772
he hit "reply all," went
to a bunch of people.

447
00:27:38,874 --> 00:27:41,508
One of them was Pierce.
Now Steve says he loves her.

448
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,711
Pierce wants to kill him.
Megan's really freaking out

449
00:27:44,814 --> 00:27:48,065
because... OK,
wait. So a while back,

450
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,033
someone sent this text message.

451
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,368
I didn't get it,
didn't get to see it.

452
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,705
It just came to certain
people's phones.

453
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:02,345
Why would they come back?
I was cruel. I was hateful.

454
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:05,532
You were scared.
They surprised you.

455
00:28:05,634 --> 00:28:09,002
You were in shock. It wasn't what
you were expecting. You were...

456
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,272
- You were just...
- I was awful.

457
00:28:12,374 --> 00:28:14,408
You were scared.

458
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:18,062
And you were trying
to protect them.

459
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:21,114
If they're your friends,
they'll understand.

460
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:39,233
I didn't want you
to see it. This.

461
00:28:39,335 --> 00:28:42,953
This ugliness,
it... it isn't me.

462
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,656
I... I didn't want
you to see it.

463
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:53,230
This, right here,

464
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:56,166
looks just like the
Coryanthes speciosa.

465
00:28:56,251 --> 00:29:00,738
- You guys see that?
- She's right.

466
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,740
The coloring's just the same.

467
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:08,378
If the surgery doesn't take,

468
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,615
if I reject the donor
face, I'll be uglier.

469
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:14,997
I'll... I'll be even uglier
than I am right now.

470
00:29:15,037 --> 00:29:19,155
Please don't call
my dear friend ugly.

471
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,224
You're a survivor.

472
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:24,061
And it's written
all over your face.

473
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,936
What the hell is
this? This is not OK.

474
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,055
I have a hospital to run.

475
00:29:52,158 --> 00:29:55,074
And Derek! What's
the matter with you?

476
00:29:55,176 --> 00:29:57,016
- We've all been there.
- We said that.

477
00:29:57,112 --> 00:30:01,331
- We've all had tough losses.
- He knows that.

478
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:04,201
We show up the next day and
we try and save the next life.

479
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:09,423
- Yeah, we covered that too.
- OK, what about this?

480
00:30:09,525 --> 00:30:11,719
Nothing we do can stop death.

481
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:15,279
We can hold it at bay now
and then. But everyone dies.

482
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:16,613
And that's not on us.

483
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,222
I took a pregnant woman in for a
simple surgery, and I botched it.

484
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:30,127
That is on me. I should
feel badly about that.

485
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:33,730
And you? You should feel
badly that while I was out here,

486
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:38,585
you sent Meredith out here expecting
a ring. Why would you do that?

487
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:41,771
Why in God's name
would you do that?

488
00:30:45,494 --> 00:30:47,059
I was trying to help.

489
00:30:48,196 --> 00:30:50,297
She didn't wanna come.

490
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,719
She wanted to leave
you out here alone...

491
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,719
- I was trying to help.
- Trying to help
yourself, not me.

492
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,189
Yourself.

493
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,359
I hit the ring in the woods.

494
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:03,910
In the woods.

495
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:07,497
You destroyed me.

496
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:20,226
This is the final dissection.
We'll place the facial graft.

497
00:31:20,329 --> 00:31:23,129
I'll connect vessels and nerves.
Get the microscope ready.

498
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:25,315
Yes, right away.

499
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,569
OK, people. It's time.

500
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,224
- Ever put a new face
on someone?
- Really?

501
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:37,193
I'll take the right
side. You take the left.

502
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,914
Very gently.

503
00:31:41,016 --> 00:31:44,651
That's it. Take your time.
He's not going anywhere.

504
00:31:46,021 --> 00:31:47,403
Thank you.

505
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:52,859
Watch the left corner of his
mouth. You're off center just a bit.

506
00:31:53,928 --> 00:31:57,914
There we go. Careful
around the eyes.

507
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:01,768
Good. Very good, Dr. Grey.

508
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:17,629
- Get out.
- No.

509
00:32:17,653 --> 00:32:18,796
- Get out!
- No!

510
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,438
- Richard, get out!
- No!

511
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,875
I've destroyed lives
before. Several, in fact.

512
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:29,229
Yours is not one of them. I sent the
woman you love out here to help you.

513
00:32:29,331 --> 00:32:33,083
I sent the woman who loves you
out here to bring you back to your life.

514
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:36,920
If you ruin it with her, that's
on you. I don't accept it.

515
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,640
You're scared, drunk,
don't know which way is up.

516
00:32:40,742 --> 00:32:44,594
You threw a punch at your best friend,
a ring at Meredith, wanna throw me out.

517
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,529
I'm not accepting it!

518
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,632
Because I'm older than you,

519
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,734
and I've been where you are.

520
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:54,621
You been drunk for a few
days. I was drunk for years.

521
00:32:57,776 --> 00:33:00,043
And I know you're gonna
need at least one friend

522
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,779
when you come out of
that hole you're digging.

523
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:08,819
I hope you come out of it soon.

524
00:33:12,507 --> 00:33:14,374
I'll be here when you do.

525
00:33:16,344 --> 00:33:18,664
I don't think I
can get her back.

526
00:33:22,017 --> 00:33:23,583
Did you call her?

527
00:33:28,323 --> 00:33:30,806
What am I gonna say?

528
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,147
I had an affair for years.

529
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:42,018
When Adele found
out, somehow she...

530
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:48,725
She took me back.

531
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:54,264
You can make your way back...

532
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,167
from anything.

533
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:02,605
This is year one
of your residency.

534
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:05,641
You turn on each other
now, you're not gonna make it.

535
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:13,316
OK. Here's what's gonna happen.

536
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:16,731
All of you are going to go find
the sense the good Lord gave you

537
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:20,941
and never behave like this
within the four walls of this hospital

538
00:34:21,043 --> 00:34:23,443
ever again. You are doctors.

539
00:34:23,545 --> 00:34:27,797
Pierce, get an ice pack and put it on
that oozing, disgusting mess of an eye.

540
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:31,351
And, Steve, go to the pit
and get that unsanitary,

541
00:34:31,453 --> 00:34:34,354
bloody hand
X-rayed and stitched.

542
00:34:34,456 --> 00:34:39,643
And, Megan, you should go to
OB because yes, you are pregnant.

543
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:43,847
That was very Bailey.

544
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:51,003
- You ready, Dr. Yang?
- Wait! I'm sorry.

545
00:34:51,105 --> 00:34:53,406
I need one thing from
you before I go under.

546
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,676
I haven't asked for much. You
haven't answered my questions.

547
00:34:56,778 --> 00:34:59,311
I understand you're
busy, but I'm scared.

548
00:34:59,414 --> 00:35:02,916
I don't wanna die. I want to go
on a tour of Russia with my friends.

549
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:07,887
I may just be a batty old lady to
you, and this may be a silly procedure,

550
00:35:07,989 --> 00:35:11,591
but I need you to tell
me that it's gonna be OK.

551
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:14,177
You're my surgeon, after all.

552
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,881
This isn't a silly procedure
to me, Miss Sulley.

553
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:22,718
- And I will get you
through this.
- OK.

554
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:24,220
Thank you.

555
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,989
I'm ready now.

556
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:48,911
Izzie has stage four
metastatic melanoma

557
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:51,547
that has spread to
her brain, liver and skin.

558
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:55,935
She may only have months to
live and she's resisting treatment.

559
00:35:56,037 --> 00:35:58,004
She needs help.

560
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:03,826
Scalpel.

Don't try to talk.
It'll only hurt.

564
00:36:20,495 --> 00:36:23,546
- You did great.
- Can he see his new face?

565
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:26,883
- I think he'd really
like to see it.
- It's still early.

566
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:31,221
It's very swollen and bruised.
The tissue needs time to settle.

567
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:35,658
But yeah. I'll give
you a sneak peak.

568
00:37:28,196 --> 00:37:30,630
Sometimes we fail, but
that's not always the case.

569
00:37:30,732 --> 00:37:32,665
I know.

570
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:34,434
Blowhole has a new face.

571
00:37:34,536 --> 00:37:37,220
And what people call him

572
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:38,721
I know.

573
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:44,560
I told Alex. And Bailey.

574
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:47,997
And they're telling
Meredith and George.

575
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,199
- Cristina...
- I couldn't do my job.

576
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:52,902
I think you came to me for
help, and that's what I did.

577
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,938
Because sometimes we win, Izzie.

578
00:37:56,575 --> 00:37:58,007
And I want you to fight.

579
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,195
OK? For whatever that's
worth, I want you to fight.

580
00:38:10,438 --> 00:38:11,921
Thank you.

581
00:38:51,012 --> 00:38:52,479
Dr. Grey.

582
00:38:53,648 --> 00:38:55,460
They think you're
taking advantage of me,

583
00:38:55,484 --> 00:38:56,782
that I'm using you.

584
00:38:56,884 --> 00:38:58,952
But they don't know us.

585
00:38:59,054 --> 00:39:02,789
They think that we're ugly,
but I know that we're beautiful.

586
00:39:02,891 --> 00:39:05,458
And we can adapt to
a hostile environment.

Would you still love
me if I wasn't a surgeon?

594
00:39:41,163 --> 00:39:42,378
No.

595
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:52,655
No, because Izzie...

596
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:56,826
has skin cancer that's
spread to her brain.

597
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:03,499
You're one of about 20 people
in the world who can save her.

I don't know if I respect somebody
who could walk away from a gift like that.

599

So please don't.

600
