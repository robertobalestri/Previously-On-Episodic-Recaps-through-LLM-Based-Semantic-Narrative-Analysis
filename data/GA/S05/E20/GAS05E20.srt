1
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:04,314
<i>- Previously on</i> Grey's
Anatomy: - Izzie has

2
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:07,405
stage four melanoma that has
spread to her brain, liver and skin.

3
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,958
He threw the first punch.
I should talk to him?

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,260
- Mr. Torres.
- She's my only little girl.

5
00:00:12,362 --> 00:00:14,713
- The minute you hurt her...
- I'm engaged.

6
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:16,614
I broke up with Owen.

7
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:24,790
<i>Defeat isn't an option.</i>

8
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:29,428
<i>Not for surgeons.</i>

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,615
<i>We don't back away from the
table till the last breath's long gone.</i>

10
00:00:35,585 --> 00:00:38,086
<i>"Terminal's" a challenge.</i>

11
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:45,360
<i>"Life threatening" is what gets
us out of bed in the morning.</i>

00:01:10,888 --> 00:01:12,688
<i>We don't flinch,</i>

00:01:13,724 --> 00:01:15,574

00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,978

<i>♪ And he won't ask

26
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,713
Does it bother you that
I don't wanna wear it?

27
00:01:37,815 --> 00:01:41,583
- Because I... I could.
- I don't want you to wear it.

28
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,317
You're not a ring bride.

29
00:01:44,588 --> 00:01:46,121
What?

30
00:01:46,223 --> 00:01:49,424
I'm not really a
church wedding bride,

31
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,627
or a poufy white
dress bride either.

32
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:57,065
We'll get naked and get
married in a field of flowers.

33
00:01:57,167 --> 00:02:00,468
- I'm not a naked bride!
- We'll get married in scrubs.

34
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,339
- Ooh! There's a wedding
I can get into.
- We gotta go.

35
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,843
So I told Izzie she could
help with the wedding,

36
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:12,614
keeps her mind off of everything. I'll
tell her about the scrubs and no church.

37
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,549
We have a theme: simplicity.

38
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:21,857
Maybe they can make you a
bouquet of scalpels and clamps.

39
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,344
That would be fun. I'd
have to run it by Izzie first.

40
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,264
I don't feel anything.

41
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,782
Nothing?

42
00:02:47,884 --> 00:02:53,488
No anger, happiness,
unhappiness?

43
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:55,057
Guilt?

44
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:57,960
Survivor's guilt?

45
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:03,898
- It's very common
with veterans.
- It's not about my platoon.

46
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,337
You have shoved your
feelings aside for so long.

47
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,506
I'm asking you to claim them.

48
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:16,611
And Owen, this is
about your platoon.

49
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:20,031
It's about the fact that I tried
to choke my girlfriend to death.

50
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,969
The way I feel about my platoon and
what happened with Cristina are the same?

51
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,271
They're not.

52
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,441
How will you know if you
can't name those feelings.

53
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,109
That's not what it's...

54
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:33,645
It's...

55
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,181
I don't know.

56
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:40,985
What do you mean you don't
deliver dresses? Just to try on?

57
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:45,357
No, no, I can't come
in. I... have cancer.

58
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,509
I'm bed-bound and dying.

59
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:56,301
Fabulous! I'll fax
you my choices. Hi!

60
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:59,071
Uh, what do you need?
Blood, pee, what can I get you?

61
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:01,706
Just checking in on you,
see how the chemo's sitting.

62
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,625
Fine. I haven't puked yet.

63
00:04:03,727 --> 00:04:06,811
- I'm making progress
on Mer's wedding.
- You should take it easy.

64
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,592
Chemo's gonna
take a lot out of you.

65
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,632
I'll let you know
if I hit the wall.

66
00:04:10,734 --> 00:04:13,585
Hello? Hi, yes. I wanted to
discuss, um, flower arrangements.

67
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:18,674
She needs to save her energy. This
isn't just chemo. It's high dose IL-2.

68
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:23,211
It makes the body attack itself. She's
walking around, but it's not gonna last.

69
00:04:23,313 --> 00:04:26,715
Blood pressure will tank,
shaking with chills, nauseous.

70
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:29,066
She might even
have a heart attack.

71
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:34,522
Believe me, a few
hours from now,

72
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:37,709
Izzie Stevens is gonna
wish she were dead.

73
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,122
- Is he here yet?
- Talking about Calliope's dad?

74
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:54,192
The answer is I don't know
because I'm not meeting him

75
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:57,829
- because it's way too soon.
- And Torres is OK with that?

76
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:01,566
Her idea. The man's here for one
day, then he's gone. No muss, no fuss.

77
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:10,925
- Run. Run for your life.
- What do you mean
"run for my life"?

78
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,029
- Oh, God! Dad!
- Give me one good reason

79
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:16,131
- I shouldn't kill you.
- Stop it!

80
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:19,067
- You committed adultery.
- Who hasn't?! I slept with him

81
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:22,787
before we were divorced, so
George isn't the only one who cheated.

82
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,092
Good God!

83
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,328
Give me one reason
I shouldn't kill you.

84
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:33,514
- Mark Sloan. Pleasure to meet you.
- Dad, Mark's just a friend.

85
00:05:33,617 --> 00:05:39,187
I'm happy, OK? I'm dating
someone now and I'm happy, OK?

86
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:47,796
You're dating again.
That's good, healthy.

87
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:51,583
I'd like to meet this
new gentleman suitor.

88
00:05:52,202 --> 00:05:54,169
Yeah. Yeah, no, um...

89
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:58,857
They're pretty busy 'cause they're a
doctor here, but, um, you'll love them.

90
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,643
You'll love them because
they're smart and funny, and...

91
00:06:01,745 --> 00:06:06,431
both handsome and, and
beautiful and, and very supportive.

92
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:11,403
Daddy? Please be OK with this.

93
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:22,931
Dad, this is Arizona Robbins.

94
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:25,433
This is who I'm dating now.

95
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:30,604
I really hope you draw the line
at throwing women against walls.

96
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:33,236
- You page me?
- Driver's face went through window.

97
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,260
- Your cup of tea.
- Right you are.

98
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,465
- What do you got?
- Anthony Meloy, 32-year-old male

99
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:44,235
pedestrian with a left arm injury
and road rash to his face and torso.

100
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,605
Stable vitals. Landed on the
street after he was hit by the driver.

101
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:49,574
I didn't hit him. He
jumped in front of me!

102
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,843
Dan Gates. Swerved
after he didn't hit Mr. Meloy

103
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:55,330
and sideswiped a pole.
Complains of abdominal pain.

104
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:58,583
- Blood from his left ear...
- He came out of nowhere!

105
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:01,435
Give him a blood alcohol
test. Driving like a madman!

106
00:07:01,537 --> 00:07:04,039
- Now he's just lying.
- I'm lying? I'm lying?!

107
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,290
- Try to stay still.
- No sign of head trauma.

108
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:09,077
Check out the other guy.
I got it from here. Let's go.

109
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,929
- I need to look
at his injuries.
- When we're inside.

110
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,199
- Drunk!
- Liar!

111
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,601
- Pathetic.
- Ass.

112
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,423
I was just driving to the bank.

113
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,515
Next thing, this guy jumped
in front of my car. Whack job.

114
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,251
- Can you move your eyebrow?
- I can't examine his ear.

115
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,854
- Would you get out of the way?
- Just wait.

116
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,725
Free fluid in the upper quadrant.
Grey, schedule a stat CT.

117
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,581
How you doing, Mr. Meloy?

118
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:50,051
- My arm's killing me,
otherwise fine.
- Tenderness and bruising

119
00:07:50,153 --> 00:07:52,197
over his humerus,
but good pulses.

120
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,622
We should still
do a full work-up.

121
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:57,792
Check in with Karev once you
assess, let him know what you find.

122
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:01,396
- I'm reporting to Karev?
- He's overseeing the pit today.

123
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,398
- You good with that, Karev?
- Yes, sir.

124
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,617
I'll be in the OR
if you need me.

125
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,736
Off you go.

126
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,308
Meeting Callie's dad was so
not on the agenda for today.

127
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,691
Seems like a man
who needs preparation

128
00:08:15,778 --> 00:08:19,314
for meeting his daughter's
girlfriend. Should have seen his face.

129
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,482
- Can you stop doing that thing?
- What thing?

130
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,464
Telling me your business
thing. It's my day off.

131
00:08:23,553 --> 00:08:26,520
- I'm here to watch
the fundoplication.
- I checked.

132
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:29,790
You worked a 90 hour
week. You should be sleeping.

133
00:08:29,892 --> 00:08:33,328
- You can stop doing that, too.
- It's just that Peds can be
tough.

134
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,663
- It can be hard on a family.
- Not mine.

135
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:39,350
My husband... is
very supportive.

136
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,687
He is... can't wait for
me to start my fellowship.

137
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,539
- He doesn't know, does he?
- No.

138
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:47,475
Why?

139
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:50,111
Dr. Robbins, Jessica had
a seizure and can't breathe.

140
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:54,916
She's got Tay-Sachs. Get a mask
on her and crank it up to 15 liters.

141
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:58,619
All right, sit up.
You're OK, honey.

142
00:08:59,722 --> 00:09:02,657
You just need to
breathe. Slow, slow.

143
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,810
Good, good.
You're getting better.

144
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,679
Slow, slow. I think you're OK.

145
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:11,616
There's no blood in the brain.

146
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,652
ZMC fracture of the temporal
bone, ruptured eardrum.

147
00:09:14,737 --> 00:09:18,306
- Book us an OR.
- Not so fast, Dr. Grey.

148
00:09:18,408 --> 00:09:22,243
Mr. Gates, the patient has a name,
injured a facial nerve. Which means?

149
00:09:22,345 --> 00:09:24,645
That Mr. Gates will
also need a nerve repair.

150
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:28,332
Does that take place before or after
Dr. Sloan's ossicular reconstruction?

151
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:36,457
- Before.
- Incorrect.

152
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:41,029
You have to explore for bone
fragments, reversing his hearing loss.

153
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:42,930
Which is why I need
you to book that OR.

154
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:46,368
If he has facial paralysis, it won't
matter if he can hear out of one ear.

155
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,121
- Am I right, Dr. Grey?
- Uh...

156
00:09:50,206 --> 00:09:52,740
- Dr. Grey.
- Lexie?

157
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,090
- Dr. Grey.
- Lexie.

158
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:58,445
I think you both are
amazing doctors.

159
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:08,539
The car hit you while
you were in the crosswalk?

160
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:12,343
Yeah. Are you almost
done? 'Cause I need to go.

161
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,961
Uh, no, um...

162
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,849
Because we need to wait for
the police. They need a statement.

163
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:22,319
Is that necessary? Can't I just
leave my name and number?

164
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,273
I just need you to wait
here for one minute. OK?

165
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,559
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

166
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:31,329
Alex. I need to order a
psych consult for Mr. Meloy.

167
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:34,231
He said he was walking,
but the pattern of his injuries

168
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:37,018
aren't consistent. Plus,
he's acting agitated.

169
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,888
Maybe because he was hit by a
car. Or 'cause he has you as a doctor.

170
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,908
You need to discharge him.
We've a lot of other patients

171
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:45,877
- with worse injuries.
- If he leaves

172
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,313
and he hurts
himself, it's on you.

173
00:10:52,301 --> 00:10:55,619
Fine. Get your consult. But if
someone in that waiting room dies

174
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:58,289
because we don't have
a bed, that's on you.

175
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,628
I hear congratulations
are in order.

176
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,115
- What?
- The engagement.

177
00:11:07,217 --> 00:11:11,619
Our very own Seattle Grace wedding. I
couldn't be happier for the both of you.

178
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:13,954
Thank you, sir. Did you
have an assignment?

179
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,657
- Dresses.
- I'm sorry?

180
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,644
Stevens has transformed her
room into a bridal boutique. So go.

181
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:23,547
Try on dresses. That's an order.

182
00:11:26,136 --> 00:11:28,536
- I didn't think
you wanted a dress.
- I don't.

183
00:11:28,638 --> 00:11:31,872
- How does he even know
we're engaged?
- Richard's my friend.

184
00:11:31,974 --> 00:11:35,492
He didn't order the dress. If
you don't want to wear a dress,

185
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:38,496
- talk to Izzie.
- Yeah. As the chemo drips

186
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:42,233
into her cancer-y arm and she
looks at me with those cancer-y eyes,

187
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:45,036
- those cancer-y,
wedding-loving eyes?
- Be strong.

188
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:49,507
We'll have bridesmaids in pink taffeta.
You'll wear top hat and morning coat

189
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:52,043
and somebody will sing
<i>Wind-Beneath-My-Freaking-Wings.</i>

190
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:56,347
- You want me to talk to her?
- OK, I'm glad we talked.

191
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,692
Apparently, a morning
coat is non-negotiable.

192
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:10,645
Also, we have to make time
for ballroom dancing lessons.

193
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,818
Just so you know, I wasn't
looking for a relationship.

194
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:22,290
Not with anyone,
a he or a she. But...

195
00:12:22,392 --> 00:12:24,525
it just happened.

196
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:27,829
And, uh...

197
00:12:27,931 --> 00:12:29,263
It feels good with her.

198
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:31,582
It feels easy and, uh...

199
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:32,984
comfortable.

200
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,221
I'm saying I'm happy.

201
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:38,756
When have you ever heard
me willingly admit that?

202
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:42,460
When you lived at home
with your mother and me.

203
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:46,997
- You were happy then.
- I was 12. It didn't take much.

204
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,111
Fly home with me.
I'll talk to the chief,

205
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,369
- explain the circumstances.
- What?!

206
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,404
Dad, no. I'm not
moving back home!

207
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:55,857
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be OK.

208
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,426
Everything is... O... OK.

209
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:08,703
Tay-Sachs is always fatal in children,
usually by the age of four or five.

210
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,255
She's six.

211
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:17,578
I spoke to my friend who's
fundraising for Jessica.

212
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,665
This place in Mexico. They do
experimental stem cell therapy.

213
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,527
A couple of weeks, we'll
have enough money...

214
00:13:22,586 --> 00:13:26,020
Matt, Jessica doesn't
have a couple of weeks.

215
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:30,274
It's quite possible she
only has a couple of hours.

216
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:33,144
We talked about this.
We've talked about this a lot.

217
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:36,030
And now it's here.
And I know it's hard.

218
00:13:36,132 --> 00:13:40,084
I know it's impossible. But
we've done everything we can.

219
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:45,506
- You have done
everything you...
- No. No!

220
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:48,593
Listen. All we need
is a little more time.

221
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:51,196
If you read about
these treatments...

222
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:59,086
I don't mean to insult you. I
know you've done everything.

223
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:04,124
I just need a few more days, more time.
She's a fighter. You know she'll fight.

224
00:14:04,226 --> 00:14:06,577
- I just need to get her there.
- Matt.

225
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,514
She's not gonna
make it to Mexico.

226
00:14:13,303 --> 00:14:15,303
And I am so sorry,

227
00:14:15,405 --> 00:14:20,808
but the best thing you can
do for her now is to be here.

228
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,042
No!

229
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,998
Don't tell me what's best.

230
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,601
You don't tell me.
I will find a way.

231
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,454
I will get her to
Mexico tonight.

232
00:14:33,556 --> 00:14:37,958
Shame on you for giving up on
her. Shame on you, Dr. Robbins.

233
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:59,480
Get a crash cart to Izzie
Steven's room! Izzie!

234
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:08,673
What?

235
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:16,013
I'm sorry! You should see your
face! It's your totally-freaking-out face!

236
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:20,635
- You're joking? This is a joke?
- I'm sorry.

237
00:15:20,737 --> 00:15:22,981
I really did need you, though.

238
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,641
I have all these dresses. I keep
paging Meredith to come try them on,

239
00:15:26,743 --> 00:15:30,310
and she won't answer. So
will you tell her to come in here?

240
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:32,046
She'll listen to you.

241
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,752
You have damage to your facial nerve
from a broken bone behind your ear.

242
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:42,473
- Which I'll repair.
- Also, bleeding
around your spleen.

243
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,909
- We'll keep an eye on it.
- Your eardrum ruptured.

244
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,394
You might lose the
hearing in your left ear.

245
00:15:47,496 --> 00:15:50,248
Unbelievable. Unbelievable!

246
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,151
- That son of a bitch!
- Mr. Gates, try and stay calm.

247
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,087
No. Don't tell me to stay calm.

248
00:15:56,189 --> 00:16:00,024
That son of bitch dove in
front of my car. He dove!

249
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:04,495
Like he was Superman. Had his
arms stretched out and everything!

250
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,714
I was going to the bank.

251
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,450
I was just...

252
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,103
going to the bank.

253
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:18,425
If I show you the dress, you can
never tell anyone because it's bad.

254
00:16:18,527 --> 00:16:22,997
- Really, really bad.
- OK, fine. It'll be
our little secret.

255
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:34,208
Oh, wow.

256
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:38,913
- Photos are not secret!
- Isn't there a tiara
that goes with it?

257
00:16:39,015 --> 00:16:43,367
- Put it on so I get
the full effect.
- No tiara. I told you simple.

258
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,103
- Buffalo wings
at the reception.
- You can't.

259
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,083
Caterers don't do buffalo wings.

260
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:51,425
Iz, this is a small
wedding. Small.

261
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:54,945
This is a big dress
for a big wedding.

262
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,648
Don't you have a dress that
doesn't make noise when it moves

263
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,350
- or stand up by itself?
- You're getting married.

264
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:04,588
It's a miracle. Meredith Grey,
child of darkness, found someone.

265
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:08,325
Don't want to celebrate
that? It's your day, Meredith.

266
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:10,794
You can't just piss it
away on a slip dress

267
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:15,899
and a cheese tray from the grocery
store. That will make me so sad.

268
00:17:15,985 --> 00:17:20,571
I don't want to be sad. I'm suffering
through cancer. That's sad enough.

269
00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:25,058
Fine, give me the tiara.

270
00:17:29,732 --> 00:17:32,065
Oh! You're like a princess.

271
00:17:32,168 --> 00:17:34,818
Smile.

272
00:17:34,904 --> 00:17:36,587
I mean, home! He's
dragging me home!

273
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,354
Who I want to spend it with!

274
00:17:42,378 --> 00:17:45,430
Got it. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

275
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:49,267
I can see you're very upset.

276
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,919
You page me, Robbins?

277
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:55,139
You're her best friend
and I am at a giant loss,

278
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:58,392
- not to mention
the sick children...
- Go. I got this.

279
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,814
Hey!

280
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,084
Stop speaking Spanish because
I have to go to surgery in a minute

281
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:11,322
- and I don't speak Spanish.
- My dad is taking me home.

282
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,759
Talking to the chief and making
me quit my job and relationship,

283
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,410
he has yet to
acknowledge exists.

284
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,223
Are you 12? Tell him he's crazy.

285
00:18:18,247 --> 00:18:22,967
You don't understand. There isn't
anything he hasn't done for me. Nothing.

286
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:26,203
He paid for my college, med
school. I have a huge trust fund.

287
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,373
He doesn't want me to worry
about anything but being a doctor.

288
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:33,778
The man's done nothing
but support me his whole life.

289
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:39,683
Supporting someone and respecting
someone aren't the same thing.

290
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,852
You need to tell him that.

291
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,728
Well, look who's up.

292
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,915
- Where's my dad?
- He should be here soon.

293
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:57,017
How you feeling?

294
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:59,620
You want some water?

295
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:04,208
- I want my dad.
- It's OK.

296
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,044
It's OK.

297
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,249
Um...

298
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:16,536
When my little boy is scared,
know what makes him feel better?

299
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:23,644
When he rocks in the chair
with me. Let me show you.

300
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,113
Here we go. All righty.

301
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:32,019
There we go, sweetie.

302
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:39,343
Yeah. He likes this.

303
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:42,279
He likes this a lot.

304
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,718
There you go.

305
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,120
I got you the cheeseburger
you wanted. You sure about this?

306
00:20:06,222 --> 00:20:10,508
- You're OK? Not feeling nauseous?
- No, I'm good, I'm fine. See?

307
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:12,659
Hi.

308
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,886
- French fries. I love French fries.
- Meredith, let's go.

309
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:20,217
I feel like this dress is giving me a
mammogram. It's squishing my boobs.

310
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,569
- Let me see it.
- I'm taking it off.

311
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,592
- Izzie, you OK?
- I think she's choking.

312
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:32,212
Let's hit her with oxygen. Izzie.
Speak to me. Say something. Izzie?

313
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,581
I'm not choking!

314
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:38,068
I'm joking.

315
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,270
OK, you gotta stop
doing that. It's not funny.

316
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:43,424
Got Meredith out so I could see
her in her the dress. And it's gorgeous.

317
00:20:43,526 --> 00:20:45,192
- Tell her she has to stop.
- Izzie!

318
00:20:45,294 --> 00:20:47,654
- Very romantic. It's pretty, right?
- Pretty.

319
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:51,048
And I see you've invited more
people to witness my humiliation?

320
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:55,202
No. Derek and Mark aren't speaking.
We're heading into a six-hour surgery.

321
00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:59,740
Unless I slip this burger into a
sterile area, I'm not gonna make it.

322
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:03,661
- Can you please come
talk to them?
- Fine. OK. You can go.

323
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,631
Cristina, will you help
her take the dress off?

324
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:09,366
I'll be in the scrub room.

325
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,587
Lexie just ate all my fries. Can
you please get me some more?

326
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,790
Nice. The IL-2 isn't
affecting you at all.

327
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,133
OK.

328
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:13,230
Doctor said if we can find a way
to get her there, he'll treat Jessica.

329
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,416
Matt, she's been asking for you.

330
00:22:21,657 --> 00:22:25,058
Hey, baby. Guess what?

331
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,245
We're gonna go to Mexico
and you're gonna love it there.

332
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:32,016
The sky is so blue
and the sand is white.

333
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:35,168
- And the water...
- Can we go tomorrow, Daddy?

334
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,487
I'm so tired.

335
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,662
Why don't you trade places
with me. It's you she wants.

336
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:47,964
All I need is plane fare.
Then we'll be on our way.

337
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:02,362
I can get someone to
relieve you for a while.

338
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,082
If you still want to watch
me do that fundoplication.

339
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,027
I'm OK.

340
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:25,802
OK. Before you guys go in there
and start cutting on this patient,

341
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,189
you need to apologize to each
other. If not for the patient, for me.

342
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:31,675
Or for Lexie. Look at her.

343
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:35,345
Her face is breaking out.
Her ass is humongous.

344
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:38,815
It's true. I had to get the
scrubs with the elastic waistband.

345
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,984
If you don't apologize,
she's not scrubbing in.

346
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:44,488
I won't. You can't make me.
This should be a joyful time.

347
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:48,742
- You should be the best man.
- The chief will be my best man.

348
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,377
What?

349
00:23:51,947 --> 00:23:56,566
- Is my ass really...?
- Lexie, will you excuse us? Please.

350
00:23:57,837 --> 00:24:00,471
- The chief?
- The best man is my choice.

351
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:02,706
When are you gonna let
go of the grudge you have?

352
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:06,193
Derek, the man had
an affair with my mother,

353
00:24:06,295 --> 00:24:10,547
broke up my parents' marriage
and basically destroyed my childhood.

354
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,450
Meanwhile, you've been best
friends with Mark for 20 years,

355
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,036
and you're willing to throw
all that away over nothing.

356
00:24:16,138 --> 00:24:20,974
So don't talk to me about grudges. I'll
get over mine when you get over yours.

357
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:34,037
- What are you doing up here?
- I stopped by
to see Dr. Stevens.

358
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,785
- I'm on my way back.
- What happened
with the pedestrian?

359
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,943
- Did the cops talk to him?
- I don't know. I don't think so.

360
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:43,130
You don't know? That guy
may have tried to kill himself.

361
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:46,600
- I called for a psych consult.
- A potentially suicidal patient

362
00:24:46,702 --> 00:24:51,104
and you're wandering around up here?
The guy who hit him is headed to an OR.

363
00:24:51,206 --> 00:24:53,908
He's in terrible
shape. He may not live!

364
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:56,076
- I...
- Quiet!

365
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:58,812
If that guy threw
himself in front of that car,

366
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:03,233
he should pay. He should pay.
He better not walk out of that ER!

367
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:08,021
Move faster, Karev!

368
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:14,378
- You asked for a psych consult?
- Yes, I did.

369
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,880
Where is he?

370
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:22,469
- Oh, crap.
- Wonderful. You've lost him.

371
00:25:22,571 --> 00:25:25,638
I have not... Have you
checked the waiting room?

372
00:25:26,342 --> 00:25:28,775
O'Malley! Where's Mr. Meloy?

373
00:25:30,212 --> 00:25:33,780
Pysch was supposed to be examining
him and he's not my only patient.

374
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:39,553
Nice. Nice! You lost him.

375
00:25:39,655 --> 00:25:41,588
Hunt is gonna love
hearing about this.

376
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,774
You didn't want
the pysch consult!

377
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:47,094
I don't get it. I don't... I tried to
give you the benefit of the doubt...

378
00:25:47,196 --> 00:25:50,180
I don't get what Hunt sees in you
and I don't understand what Izzie sees.

379
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:54,251
Shut up! I'm the one who's
tried. Izzie likes you. So I've tried.

380
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:56,753
I've tried to find one little
ounce of respect for you,

381
00:25:56,855 --> 00:26:00,290
but you lost him. You thought he
was suicidal and turned your back.

382
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,426
That's not on me. I'm done with
you. I'm done trying to respect you.

383
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,896
I'm done!

384
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:34,336
- What happened?
- We did ATLS protocol,

385
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,677
- but he's...
- We inserted
bilateral chest tubes,

386
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:39,964
but he kept bleeding.
Then he started bradying

387
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:42,515
so we pushed atropine. I opened
his chest when we lost vitals.

388
00:26:42,617 --> 00:26:45,085
Found edge of rib protruding
into his ascending aorta.

389
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,554
I attached a clamp and
I'm getting heart activity.

390
00:26:47,656 --> 00:26:49,289
- You got an OR lined up?
- OR Two.

391
00:26:49,391 --> 00:26:51,975
- Good work, O'Malley. Scrub in.
- His aorta was looking...

392
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,710
We got it, Karev.

393
00:26:57,266 --> 00:26:59,850
Do a middle fossa
craniotomy approach.

394
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:03,270
- Let's get diamond burrs in.
- Don't bother. I ordered them.

395
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:07,023
I may be irresponsible and
untrustworthy out there. I'm not in here.

396
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,911
- I never said untrustworthy.
- You put the Berlin Wall
around Lexie.

397
00:27:11,013 --> 00:27:14,231
Meredith asked me. People do
when someone they care about

398
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,233
asks them to do
something. They do it.

399
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:19,970
You should have, when I asked you
to stay away from Lexie. Or Addison.

400
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:23,023
Oh, here we go. Addison.
The only note he can ever play.

401
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:27,544
You know, I was gonna apologize
for decking you, 'cause I felt bad,

402
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:30,714
but now, I'm gonna play it over and
over in my head and really enjoy it.

403
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,683
Oh, hell!

404
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:36,569
- It's coming from the pterygoid plexus.
- - Get me 4-0 vicryl!

405
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:40,423
- A clamp.
- You know what? I'm done.

406
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:44,077
I give up. If I hadn't fallen for Little
Grey, you would have found a reason

407
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:48,982
not to respect me. Always have. To
you, I'm always gonna be the charity case

408
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,844
the Shepherds had to take in.

409
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,721
- I got the bleeder.
- You threw the stitch already?

410
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,874
Yeah.

411
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,960
Hmm.

412
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:03,792
Do you know where Dr. Grey is?

413
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:06,884
- No, do you want me
to page her?
- No, it's OK.

414
00:28:06,986 --> 00:28:08,519
OK.

415
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:13,940
Thank you.

416
00:28:51,614 --> 00:28:53,391
Can you hold the
retractor, please?

417
00:28:53,415 --> 00:28:56,935
He'll need 3-0 Prolene and a
Gore-Tex graft. I'll get it ready.

418
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:59,152
You're good at this.

419
00:28:59,254 --> 00:29:02,723
You're thinking ten steps ahead of
what you're doing. Not many can do that.

420
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:05,108
And the hairier things
get, the calmer you get.

421
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,095
It's something you're wired
with. Chosen your specialty yet?

422
00:29:08,197 --> 00:29:10,497
- No, sir.
- It's trauma.

423
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:16,754
I'm sorry. You want to
take Dr. Torres home?

424
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:20,807
Now, I recognize that my
daughter is a senior resident

425
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:26,213
and you've invested in her education.
I'm happy to write out a check

426
00:29:26,315 --> 00:29:30,550
for whatever amount as a
donation to your hospital.

427
00:29:30,652 --> 00:29:35,055
In exchange, I would ask you to
transfer her to St. Mary's in Miami.

428
00:29:35,157 --> 00:29:39,559
Um, I appreciate the offer,
sir. But, with all due respect,

429
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:42,328
your daughter is a grown woman.

430
00:29:44,967 --> 00:29:47,067
Does she know you're here?

431
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:52,789
You don't have children, do you?

432
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:56,643
- No, no, no. I don't.
- No. You don't.

433
00:29:56,745 --> 00:29:58,545
Because if you did...

434
00:29:59,948 --> 00:30:03,283
"Your daughter's a grown
woman..." That means nothing.

435
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,268
I mean, she's my child.

436
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:09,022
It's like the blood running through
your veins. You don't outgrow it.

437
00:30:09,124 --> 00:30:12,125
Never goes away. The love.

438
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,428
The need to protect them from
everything. From everything.

439
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,430
Even from themselves.

440
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,368
They grow up. They move out.

441
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:25,488
They change. Become people
you don't even recognize.

442
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,859
Make decisions...

443
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:35,432
And they think you don't love
them because you don't understand.

444
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:38,384
But it's the opposite.
See, it's the opposite.

445
00:30:39,655 --> 00:30:43,223
You fight for them. Always.
You never surrender.

446
00:30:43,325 --> 00:30:46,059
When your child is on the
line, you never surrender.

447
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:51,215
I called eight organizations. And they
have a wait list for emergency funds.

448
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:54,868
- I don't know what to do.
- Mr. Smithson,

449
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,387
it's time to stop now.

450
00:30:58,873 --> 00:31:02,509
Maybe if we just go to the airport,
they'll let us on a flight. I mean...

451
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,812
- People do things like that...
- Mr. Smithson.

452
00:31:05,914 --> 00:31:09,366
No! Please don't make me stop.

453
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:12,102
Please don't make me stop.
Please don't make me stop!

454
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:17,741
I wouldn't want to stop either.
But Jessica is terminal, Matt.

455
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:20,911
In a few minutes, her
heart is going to stop.

456
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:23,980
Now, I can pump her chest,

457
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,883
I can push all
sorts of medicines,

458
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:29,903
and put her on a ventilator 'cause
she'll no longer be able to breathe.

459
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:34,441
But even with all of
that, she's going to die.

460
00:31:39,014 --> 00:31:43,517
And the last person who
will have her hands on her,

461
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:46,803
who will have been
able to touch her,

462
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,356
it's gonna be me or a nurse.

463
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:52,075
Or it could be you.

464
00:31:53,428 --> 00:31:55,128
You don't want to miss this.

465
00:31:55,230 --> 00:32:00,117
This next part, she needs
her daddy for this part.

466
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:10,077
Daddy?

467
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:14,631
Are we going to Mexico?

468
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:24,107
<i>♪ You're my sweetheart ♪</i>

469
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:31,163
<i>♪ If I never see you again ♪</i>

470
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:36,586
Yes.

471
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,972
We're going to Mexico.

472
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:45,362
Where the sky is blue, blue.

473
00:32:47,315 --> 00:32:49,549
And the sand is white.

474
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:56,255
The water is so clear, you can
see all the way to the bottom.

475
00:32:59,495 --> 00:33:01,762
We're going.

476
00:33:01,864 --> 00:33:03,563
Just you and me.

477
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:08,551
No more doctors.

478
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,356
No more medicine.

479
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,758
No more hospitals.

480
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,161
Just you and me.

481
00:33:27,889 --> 00:33:32,442
We're gonna go. Just
relax. We'll be there soon.

482
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:38,248
<i>♪ Just want you to
know what I think ♪</i>

483
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,587
We'll play on the beach all day.

484
00:33:44,907 --> 00:33:46,606
We'll make sand castles.

We'll be there soon. You'll see.

489
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:02,422
We're gonna have so much fun.

490
00:34:04,426 --> 00:34:06,226
Just you and me.

491
00:34:06,828 --> 00:34:08,094
Just you and me.

492
00:34:18,006 --> 00:34:21,274
98 over 72. That's
good. That's good.

493
00:34:21,677 --> 00:34:23,476
Don't.

494
00:34:23,578 --> 00:34:26,913
Don't try to make me out
better than I am, because I'm not.

495
00:34:27,782 --> 00:34:29,716
I'm sick.

496
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:33,285
You had an incredibly
high dose of IL-2 today.

497
00:34:34,956 --> 00:34:38,891
- This is how
you're supposed to feel.
- All I wanted to do today

498
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:42,262
was flip through
magazines, call caterers

499
00:34:42,364 --> 00:34:45,298
and make Mer try on
dresses I knew she'd hate.

500
00:34:46,768 --> 00:34:50,403
I thought it would be fun or...

501
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,239
funny.

502
00:34:56,194 --> 00:35:01,530
I thought I could be the same person
I was when I woke up this morning.

503
00:35:03,135 --> 00:35:04,415
But I'm not.

504
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,332
I'm just another patient

505
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:10,757
trapped inside a sick, dying,

506
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,692
cancer-ridden body.

507
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,869
What happened?

508
00:35:44,626 --> 00:35:47,294
He, uh... gave me an ultimatum.

509
00:35:48,863 --> 00:35:52,632
He said if I don't come home,
he'll take away my trust fund.

510
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:53,967
He'd cut me off.

511
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,588
So I cut him off.

512
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:01,090
If he can't accept
me for who I am...

513
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:07,831
I cut him off.

514
00:36:10,351 --> 00:36:12,452
Are you OK?

515
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:17,973
No.

516
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:21,360
I mean... yeah. I don't know.

517
00:36:39,514 --> 00:36:43,900
I jumped in front of her car,

518
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:46,936
and she was just
driving to the bank.

519
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,189
- We're talking about Cristina?
- I jumped in front of her. I knew.

520
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:55,395
I knew I wasn't together, I knew I
was no good for her, for anyone.

521
00:36:56,264 --> 00:36:57,697
And I wrecked her.

522
00:37:00,335 --> 00:37:03,636
And that is unforgivable.

523
00:37:03,738 --> 00:37:07,457
I don't forgive myself for that.
I can't forgive myself for that.

524
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,826
And I'm feeling
shameful about that.

525
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:18,968
That's what I feel today. Shame.

526
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,554
Good. That's a start.

527
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:26,208
- How is that a start?
- You named it.

528
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:28,661
The feeling.

529
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,301
You have to know what it is

530
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,618
before you can start to
navigate to somewhere better.

531
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:41,824
He has a long recovery ahead of him.
He severely damaged his facial nerves,

532
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,061
- shattered his inner ear,
lost blood.
- Oh, my God.

533
00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:50,533
But he'll be fine. He'll be in some
pain for a while, but he'll be fine.

534
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:52,969
Oh, my God. Thank you.
Thank you both so much.

535
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:56,189
Thank Dr. Sloan. That bleeding,
not a lot of surgeons can handle.

536
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,007
He saved your husband's life.

537
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:04,514
- Would you like to see him now?
- Yes. Thank you.

538
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,467
You know, that's the first
compliment you've ever given me.

539
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:10,970
- It was a statement of fact.
- See, why do you do that?

540
00:38:11,072 --> 00:38:13,283
Why can't you just give
a person a compliment?

541
00:38:13,307 --> 00:38:15,808
If you have to ask, it's not a
compliment. Are you asking?

542
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:18,177
- Yes.
- Then it's not a compliment.

543
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:26,819
Is there anything else
you need before I go?

544
00:38:27,923 --> 00:38:29,288
No.

545
00:38:30,925 --> 00:38:33,693
- You want to sit a while?
- No, I do not want to sit.

546
00:38:33,795 --> 00:38:37,764
I been sitting and
lying down all day.

547
00:38:37,866 --> 00:38:40,767
- Dr. Bailey...
- Holding a child.

548
00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:44,537
If I wanted to spend
the day holding a child,

549
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:48,007
I would have stayed
home to hold my own child.

550
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:52,045
I didn't do a single
medical thing today.

551
00:38:52,146 --> 00:38:55,465
I didn't even put a Band-Aid
on a patient. I'm just tired.

552
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:58,518
I... I'm done.

553
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,901
Are you gonna tell your husband?

554
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,394
What would I tell him?

555
00:39:08,496 --> 00:39:11,080
That it's more
than just cutting.

556
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,617
Peds is more than just cutting.

557
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,888
And what you did
today was heroic.

558
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:24,410
And you know it.

559
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,265
OK.

560
00:39:31,152 --> 00:39:33,102
Maybe I'll tell him that.

562
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:42,112

You kicked ass today,
O'Malley. You kicked my ass.

581
00:40:44,592 --> 00:40:49,762
- I just did what I had to do.
- No. You kicked ass.

582
00:40:50,398 --> 00:40:52,948
I'm not like that.

583
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:57,536
I'm good, but I'm not like you.
I'm not good under pressure.

584
00:41:03,344 --> 00:41:06,112
She's really sick.

585
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:11,333
Really sick. And I'm
not good under pressure.

586
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:14,954
<i>But even when our
hopes give way to reality...</i>

587
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:18,258

588
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:22,144

589
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,046
Could I have another, please?

00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,832
<i>Not tomorrow's war.</i>

591
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:32,922
So I guess a big
wedding won't be that bad.

592
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:36,458
I'm just sad 'cause I didn't get a
chance to see you in the actual dress.

593
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,245
- You will.
- How?

594
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:43,098
- If Derek
and Mark don't make up...
- You're my sister, Lexie.

595
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:45,118
You're in the wedding.

596
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:49,789
Oh, my God! I'm
gonna be a bridesmaid?

597
00:41:49,891 --> 00:41:52,057
Oh, my God! I don't
know what to say.

598
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:56,162
Wait and see what Izzie's picked out
for you to wear. You'll have plenty to say.

599
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:58,330
<i>Here's the thing
about surrender.</i>

600
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,783
<i>- </i> You want one?
- So much.

601
00:42:00,886 --> 00:42:03,463
<i>- Once you do it...</i>
<i>- </i> We can still catch
half of the game.

602
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:07,340
- Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.
<i>- Actually give in...</i>

603
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:11,577
<i>you forget why you were
even fighting in the first place.</i>

604
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,114
- You can stop eating now.
- Oh, thank God.
