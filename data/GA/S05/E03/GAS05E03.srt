00:00:02,403 --> 00:00:04,836
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:07,416
Surgical training protocol
is officially changing, people.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,000
Thought you'd defend your
boyfriend to me and I'd take it?

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,271
He's not my boyfriend.

5
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:12,722
- Hi.
- Hi.

6
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,813
You and Derek will not work.

7
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:16,748
Why do you care what I think?

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,152
If I'm gonna do this with him,
I need you to cheer me on.

9
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:27,225
<i>As surgeons, we are
trained to fix what's broken.</i>

10
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,811
I'm in a hurry. I can't stay.

11
00:00:29,913 --> 00:00:31,613
Chief's having a big meeting,

12
00:00:31,715 --> 00:00:34,900
but I wanted to tell you
that I'm finished with therapy.

13
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:38,620
<i>The breaking point is
our starting line at work.</i>

14
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:42,174
Meredith, you are not finished.

15
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:45,344
You have worked incredibly
hard. Look how far you've come.

16
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:47,929
- You're scratching the surface.
- Derek's moved in

17
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:49,942
and we've taken
it to the next level.

18
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,933
It's not about Derek.

19
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:53,647
- I'm happy.
- You're not done.

20
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:56,288
I am happy. Isn't
that the point?

21
00:00:56,373 --> 00:00:58,373
- No.
<i>- But in our lives,</i>

22
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,475
<i>the breaking point
is a sign of weakness.</i>

23
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,278
- I need you to stay. I know.
- The meeting, the Chief.

24
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,030
Thank you, Dr. Wyatt.

25
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:06,965
Thanks for everything.

26
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,401
<i>And we'll do everything
we can to avoid it.</i>

27
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:13,288
<i>♪ Trying to place a
name on what it's called ♪</i>

28
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,474
<i>♪ Make you feel
like a losing streak ♪</i>

29
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:16,775
Whoa!

30
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,844
- Sorry.
- What are you doing in here?

31
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:21,713
Thinking about making this
my office when you move out.

32
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,965
When I move out?
When am I moving out?

33
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:25,767
Oh. Soon?

34
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,003
<i>♪ Louder than
they Allow, allow ♪</i>

35
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:29,621
- <i>♪ Say Aha, Aha ♪</i>
- Mmm.

36
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:32,440
You know Meredith was
planning on making us move out?

37
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:34,676
- I'm busy here.
- Join us if you want.

38
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:36,177
No!

39
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,981
When were you planning
on telling us we had to move?

40
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:42,350
When did you plan to tell
them they had to move?

41
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:44,819
- Why do they have to move?
- I made this for you.

42
00:01:44,922 --> 00:01:47,388
It's a zoo, a frathouse. Alex
and his parade of women.

43
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,391
- His parade of skanks.
- Am I apartment hunting?

44
00:01:50,493 --> 00:01:52,013
I don't know. I have
to think about it.

45
00:01:52,096 --> 00:01:55,180
Just eat the muffin,
Mer. Taste the muffin.

46
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,131
Remember the muffin.

47
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,335
- I like my roommates.
- I like them too.

48
00:02:00,437 --> 00:02:02,816
That was your
life. This is our life,

49
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,540
and I'm excited about
building our life together.

50
00:02:05,642 --> 00:02:08,059
Come on. It's gonna be great.

51
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,888
So Derek wants Alex
and Izzie to move out.

52
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,458
Since when does he
say "jump" and you jump?

53
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,562
- Well, I'm happy.
- They'll be pissed off.

54
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,715
But do whatever you want.

55
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:35,153
Hey, you hear anything
about what the new rules are?

56
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:39,324
Last I heard you were at
hand-holding, foot rubs,

57
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,393
and lots of late-night
gab sessions.

58
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:45,129
- Excuse me?
- Listen up, everyone.

59
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:47,532
You're talking about
the Chief's new rules.

60
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,268
- Thought it was you and Torres.
- Listen up!

61
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:51,870
I've been wrong before.

62
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:54,722
We're busy people, I'm
gonna try and be brief.

63
00:02:56,727 --> 00:03:00,278
I am implementing a new teaching
protocol here at Seattle Grace.

64
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:02,947
Some of these rules are new,

65
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,652
and some are old and are
going to be newly enforced.

66
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,137
Jack O'Brien, 47.

67
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,207
Scheduled for an abdominal
aortic aneurysm repair.

68
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:16,077
Last CT showed calcification.
So I ordered a CT angio

69
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:18,964
to determine if it had
worsened or remained stable.

70
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,683
Nice catch, Yang. You can
take him down after rounds.

71
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:25,570
Dr. Karev will take over. Dr. Yang,
you're done here. Thank you.

72
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,974
First, second and
third-year residents

73
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:32,410
will no longer be allowed
to de facto specialize.

74
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,696
The practice interferes
with the development

75
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,499
of a fully-rounded surgical
education. No more.

76
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:39,234
Barry Patmore, 63.

77
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:43,104
Has been experiencing chronic
headaches for the past seven years.

78
00:03:43,207 --> 00:03:46,541
Has been treated with narcotics,
anti-seizure medications,

79
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:50,912
antidepressants, and anti-psychotic
medications with no success.

80
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:52,692
How severe is the
pain, Mr. Patmore,

81
00:03:52,716 --> 00:03:56,401
- scale of one to ten?
- Eight. It's always an eight.

82
00:03:56,503 --> 00:04:00,838
Which is why Mr. Patmore's last
consult suggested a bilateral cingulotomy.

83
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,869
A frontal lobotomy
for a headache?

84
00:04:02,893 --> 00:04:06,177
Too loud. Please.

85
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:09,013
And could you do
something about the buzzing?

86
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:13,335
Do we need all these machines?

87
00:04:13,437 --> 00:04:16,938
Mr. Patmore has been
experiencing pain every day

88
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,925
- for seven years.
- A cingulotomy could cause

89
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:23,495
seizures, cognitive defects
or behavioral changes.

90
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:27,031
Which is why we are going to
explore every possible option

91
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,379
before resorting to
such a radical surgery.

92
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:32,037
- More tests?
- Yes.

93
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:36,024
Dr. Yang, you'll be
assisting Dr. Shepherd today.

94
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:39,961
Personal relationships,
personal loyalties

95
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:42,747
and personal favorites
will no longer be a factor

96
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,266
in our training program.

97
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:48,486
Attendings, you will spread
your wealth of knowledge equally

98
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,305
among all of the residents.

99
00:04:50,407 --> 00:04:52,357
In addition, we'll
refocus our attention

100
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:56,328
on patient communication and
bedside manner. For some of us,

101
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,932
this means learning the lost
art of humanity and compassion.

102
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,269
For others, this means
learning how to treat patients

103
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:07,905
without becoming
emotionally involved with them.

104
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:11,325
Shelley Boden, 30, stage four
colon cancer with liver mets.

105
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:14,295
Shelley has been through
extensive chemo and radiation.

106
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:18,182
According to the CT, a liver
resection could be curative.

107
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,251
Will be curative. Will.

108
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:22,754
Do you have any
other questions for us?

109
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:25,757
What happens if you find
more cancer than you expect?

110
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,210
No, Jen. A, that's
not gonna happen.

111
00:05:28,312 --> 00:05:32,413
B, Izzie's already answered
all of your questions three times.

112
00:05:32,515 --> 00:05:36,768
- Izzie's not the main surgeon.
- Izzie's awesome. We love Izzie.

113
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:39,237
This is Dr. Grey. She'll
prep you for surgery

114
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,417
and answer any
questions you have.

115
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,810
- Izzie's not staying?
- This is a surgical program.

116
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:47,306
Psychiatry is
on the fifth floor.

117
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,230
Let's not confuse the two.

118
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:52,333
In addition, residents,

119
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,971
your interns reflect on you.

120
00:05:56,073 --> 00:05:58,039
If they fail, you fail.

121
00:05:58,141 --> 00:06:00,558
If they succeed, you succeed.

122
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,378
Attendings, that goes
for residents as well.

123
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:07,165
Teach with enthusiasm.

124
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:10,334
Learn with enthusiasm.

125
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,837
We are surgeons.

126
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,339
We cut out malignancies.

127
00:06:16,193 --> 00:06:17,909
Let's start at home.

128
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:25,133
O'Malley? This is
Dr. Bennett Epstein.

129
00:06:25,235 --> 00:06:27,735
He'll be your proctor
for the exam today.

130
00:06:29,773 --> 00:06:32,156
- You're about ready, O'Malley?
- Yes, sir.

131
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,959
You have three hours from
the moment you open the test.

132
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,696
Once you break this seal,
you may not leave the room

133
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,148
until you have completed
the entire exam.

134
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,817
- Good luck, O'Malley.
- Thank you, sir.

135
00:06:49,526 --> 00:06:51,292
I can do this.

136
00:06:51,395 --> 00:06:54,979
I'm not married and cheating
on my wife with my best friend.

137
00:06:56,132 --> 00:06:58,967
Everything's just
as it should be.

138
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,415
Oh!

139
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,102
Damn chair. Hang on.

140
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,233
Looks like the wheel's broken.

141
00:07:20,257 --> 00:07:22,157
That's how things
work around me.

142
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:23,858
My toaster broke last month.

143
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,678
Then my cat ran away and
my back porch collapsed.

144
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,197
Also, my TV only
shows the color green.

145
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:30,865
I'll get another chair.

146
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:35,870
Don't bother. I'll
walk. Probably safer.

147
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:38,673
No. Mr. O'Brien, you
need to stay in the chair.

148
00:07:38,775 --> 00:07:41,326
- It's hospital policy.
- I had three car accidents...

149
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:46,280
Mr. O'Brien.

150
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,399
Somebody get me
a gurney over here!

151
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:58,042
- Sir, I am very sorry.
- I hit my head.

152
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,077
I am very, very sorry.

153
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,947
Get him a CT. I want hourly
updates on his condition.

154
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,450
- Yes, sir.
- You're gonna be OK.

155
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:13,124
Mike, my ceiling's raining here.

156
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,927
Looks like a pipe burst.
Gotta turn off the water...

157
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,395
No. This is a surgical floor.

158
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,031
Water's required to
scrub and clean equipment

159
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,327
to keep people alive.

160
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:23,301
- Fix this with the water on.
- I can try.

161
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:24,903
Keep me posted.

162
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:45,039
Chief, there is some kind of
leak in the conference room.

163
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:47,492
- You don't say.
- I was wondering

164
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:51,696
if there was anywhere
else I could take the exam.

165
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:58,369
I will find a different
room on my own.

166
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,489
Thank you, sir.

167
00:09:06,196 --> 00:09:07,913
We have a problem.

168
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:10,765
Mark Sloan has found us out.

169
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:14,586
Mark's known from
the beginning. I told him.

170
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,053
He's Mark Sloan.

171
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,289
You don't have a person
you talk to about things?

172
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,075
You are the person
I talk to about things.

173
00:09:21,177 --> 00:09:23,356
I like to keep my
private life private

174
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,514
from everyone, but most
definitely from Mark...

175
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,801
Sloan.

176
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:41,746
- How long'll the operation be?
- At least a couple of hours.

177
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,247
Think it could be longer?

178
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,451
If there are complications or
the mets are more extensive.

179
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:47,797
They won't be, Jen.

180
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:51,188
Please, stop. Call Mom
and Dad, tell them two hours.

181
00:09:58,281 --> 00:10:02,049
Since I got cancer, my sister's
only capable of talking about cancer,

182
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:04,235
which is so much
worse than the cancer.

183
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,971
So I know I don't
know you, but spill.

184
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,441
- Spill what?
- Anything.

185
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,911
I'm begging you,
before she comes back

186
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,457
and asks you to describe
my liver cell by cell.

187
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,098
Please.

188
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:22,153
OK. Um... Do you
want to hear about my

189
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:23,921
stupid boss or stupid boyfriend?

190
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:28,526
Oh! Boyfriend!
Definitely the boyfriend.

191
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,962
Mr. Patmore, I'm gonna give
you a variety of different stimuli

192
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:35,216
so we can take a look at
the wave patterns generated.

193
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:38,502
I need you to remove your
hand from your eyes now.

194
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:41,405
OK. Are we still at an eight?

195
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,475
- It's still at eight.
- OK.

196
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:49,830
Starting visual stimuli.

197
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,667
If you were me
you'd want them out.

198
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,691
The roommates.

199
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:02,510
- I'm not being unreasonable.
- Pulse is coming down.

200
00:11:02,612 --> 00:11:06,547
But you have to admit,
you'd want them out.

201
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:08,883
If you were me, you
would want them out.

202
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,588
If we have to operate,

203
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,358
I'll let you drill the
burr holes by yourself.

204
00:11:20,397 --> 00:11:23,131
Fine. I'd want
them out. Whatever.

205
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:25,900
I knew it. OK, Mr. Patmore.

206
00:11:26,002 --> 00:11:29,487
OK, we're gonna
change your position.

207
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:34,242
- I think I have an idea...
- No, don't think. Know.

208
00:11:34,344 --> 00:11:36,644
Run to the lab
for his test results.

209
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:42,383
But Izzie bakes
and Alex fixes things.

210
00:11:42,485 --> 00:11:45,402
OK, when I am no
longer Cancer Girl

211
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:48,722
and I can go out and meet a
hot doctor who rocks my world

212
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:50,258
and wants to move in with me,

213
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,528
I might forego the baked
goods and repair work.

214
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,582
Ooh. Heads up. Twelve o'clock.

215
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:01,669
Just so you know, Cristina thinks
you should move them out. Talk to her.

216
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,757
Dude, you failed
to mention the hair.

217
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,099
Yeah, yeah, the hair.

218
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:09,777
It's one of the many things
that makes me happy.

219
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:14,616
Dr. Sloan, I'm working with
Shepherd today on a pain patient,

220
00:12:14,718 --> 00:12:17,869
and I read this article while
I helping George study...

221
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,570
Pathetic.

222
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,040
Yes. I know, I'm pathetic.

223
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:26,227
I did read this article. I do
have a photographic memory.

224
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:29,063
Chief's on his new thing
with the interns to be heard...

225
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,784
- Use fewer words, Grey.
- I think he needs an ENT.

226
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,037
You're an ENT, right?

227
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:39,440
How are you doing
in there, Mr. O'Brien?

228
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:43,527
Could be worse. Could have
brain leaking from my ears.

229
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:47,348
That's the spirit. It'll only take a
couple more minutes. Hang on.

230
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:51,352
Guess what I
found. An apartment.

231
00:12:51,454 --> 00:12:53,370
A beautiful apartment.

232
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:56,174
With hardwood floors and
an honest-to-God fireplace

233
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,643
that you can build
honest-to-God fires in...

234
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:01,012
and I can't afford it by myself.

235
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,231
So... I thought if you
could get over yourself

236
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,417
we could live together.

237
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,887
No, thanks.

238
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:14,391
I mention the hardwood floors,
the honest-to-God fireplace?

239
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:16,944
I'd rather live in my
honest-to-God car.

240
00:13:22,285 --> 00:13:23,484
Right.

241
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,426
How's he doing? Think
we're looking at a lawsuit?

242
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:34,345
No, we don't have a
picture yet, but... no.

243
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,887
This guy doesn't seem
like the lawsuit type.

244
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:38,983
Let's hope you're right.

245
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:55,649
Hello?

246
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,938
Hello?

247
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:05,343
I cannot apologize enough.

248
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,965
Treat him like a king.
Hear that, Mr. O'Brien?

249
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,314
Dr. Karev is going to
take great care of you.

250
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,234
You are our number
one priority today.

251
00:14:13,336 --> 00:14:14,947
- Are you OK?
- God hates me.

252
00:14:14,971 --> 00:14:17,989
- Mr. O'Brien...
- My wife left me.

253
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,358
My accountant stole from me.

254
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:24,562
The store I worked
at burned down.

255
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:28,433
I was diagnosed with an aneurysm
for which I'd require surgery

256
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:32,269
in a hospital that seems
to be crumbling around me.

257
00:14:33,222 --> 00:14:34,955
God hates me.

258
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,544
You can see the remaining
tumors easily identified here.

259
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,712
Her liver looks so healthy.

260
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,294
That's the beauty
of general surgery.

261
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:46,651
See badness
surrounded by goodness.

262
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:49,770
Cut out the badness,
all's right with the world.

263
00:14:49,873 --> 00:14:52,856
It's just you and your scalpel,

264
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,710
one on one,<i> mano a mano.</i>

265
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,933
OK, this is me teaching
with enthusiasm.

266
00:15:05,855 --> 00:15:08,072
Oh...

267
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,341
Oh, no.

268
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,065
- O'Malley.
- What?!

269
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:26,273
Um... if you're
finished with your test...

270
00:15:26,376 --> 00:15:29,377
Look, the hospital's
flooding. The CT's on the fritz,

271
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:32,347
my post-op and pre-op
patients are backed up for days,

272
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:34,426
I gotta get a
handle on this thing

273
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,818
before the patients find out and
our ranking drops way past 12.

274
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,689
I found a nice, quiet room in
Psych for you to take your exam.

275
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,093
Oh, I see. Um...

276
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,095
No, you go ahead.

277
00:15:52,935 --> 00:15:54,986
Chief!

278
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,939
I am your intern at
least for one more day.

279
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,506
I can help.

280
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,747
- Dr. Shepherd, a word.
- Excuse me. Yes?

281
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:09,417
You mind if I run a
quick test on your patient?

282
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,569
He's in a lot of pain. I don't
think he needs a tummy tuck.

283
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:15,956
That's funny. No, Dr. Grey came
to me with an interesting idea.

284
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,777
Unlike you, I'm taking the Chief's
new teaching protocol seriously

285
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,128
so I listened.

286
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,964
I read a thing about swelling

287
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,865
and compression
of the ethmoid nerve.

288
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:28,219
I believe if we were to stick
a cottle elevator up his nose...

289
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,620
I'm sorry, up his nose?

290
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,905
If Dr. Grey is on
the right track,

291
00:16:32,007 --> 00:16:33,608
the patient'll let us know.

292
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:36,477
OK.

293
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,013
Mr. Patmore, I'm Dr. Sloan,

294
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:42,099
head of plastic surgery and an
ear, nose and throat specialist.

295
00:16:42,184 --> 00:16:44,351
I'd like to run a test
with your permission.

296
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:46,954
I've seen 16 ENT's.
Not one could help me.

297
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,408
Now breathe normally.

298
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,511
I'm gonna angle this into here.

299
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:59,050
Let me know when you
feel any... pain or anything.

300
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:03,370
That's it. That's the pain!

301
00:17:03,472 --> 00:17:05,923
That's what's causing the pain.

302
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,060
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

303
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,517
Anterior ethmoid
neurovascular complex.

304
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,920
A simple middle
turbinectomy will fix it.

305
00:17:20,022 --> 00:17:23,024
Unless you still want to
chop out the front of his brain.

306
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:26,877
Nicely done.

307
00:17:34,604 --> 00:17:36,003
Hi.

308
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:41,325
How'd it go?

309
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,993
Hi, Shelley.

310
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,583
We found that the mets were much
more extensive than the CT detected,

311
00:17:49,685 --> 00:17:54,171
and the main tumor actually
extended in and around

312
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,957
the major blood
vessel behind the liver.

313
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,894
We're gonna start a new
round of chemo, that's all.

314
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,807
I already have a call
in to your oncologist.

315
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:07,301
That's him. I'll be right back.

316
00:18:11,274 --> 00:18:12,839
We can manage your pain.

317
00:18:12,941 --> 00:18:15,976
I'm sorry we don't
have better news.

318
00:18:32,428 --> 00:18:36,663
So did you decide what to
do about your roommates?

319
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,070
I'm so sorry, Shelley.

320
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:46,273
Come on.

321
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,562
So how good is the
hot boyfriend in bed?

322
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:06,928
Look, we don't even
know what we are yet.

323
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:11,432
So how does Mark Sloan know?

324
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:15,368
Why are you talking
to him instead of me?

325
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,439
Ladies.

326
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,027
Am I interrupting?

327
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,729
- Your timing is perfect.
- Really?

328
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,249
Were you about to feel her up?

329
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,670
- Stop. You have to stop.
- I can't.

330
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,089
- Seriously, she hates it.
- That's why I can't.

331
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:39,594
- Don't... You want a spanking? I...
- OK?

332
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:45,466
You told Derek you think
I should kick them out?

333
00:19:45,568 --> 00:19:48,752
No. No, I...

334
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,099
I told him I would want
them out. Me, not you.

335
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:53,808
I only said it because
he wouldn't stop talking.

336
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,645
You don't think I should? I think
I'm going to. It's the adult thing to do.

337
00:19:57,747 --> 00:20:00,547
- What does your shrink say?
- I quit my shrink.

338
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:04,869
- I'm happy. We're happy.
- Can I sit here?

339
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,973
George... George, how did it go?

340
00:20:11,593 --> 00:20:15,346
There's a water problem.
I'm just trying to help the Chief.

341
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:18,015
Now the medical facts
are falling out of my ear.

342
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:19,967
Eat this, it's brain food.

343
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,837
My dude with the aneurysm?

344
00:20:22,939 --> 00:20:25,690
Fell in the water, smacked
his head, got stuck in the CT.

345
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,904
My patient's dying. I hate it
when I like them and they're dying.

346
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,679
Our guy's been in pain at
a eight the last seven years

347
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:34,698
because of an inflamed
nerve in his nose.

348
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,717
I wish I had an inflamed nerve.

349
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:40,070
There is no way that guy's been
living at an eight. He's a wimp.

350
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,289
His eight? My
three. I can take pain.

351
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:44,475
You can't talk to my
boyfriend for ten minutes.

352
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:48,479
There's pain and then there's
torture. I can take pain. Test me.

353
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,516
- Nothing.
- Impressive.

354
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:55,920
Shut up! You barely touched her.

355
00:20:57,073 --> 00:20:59,606
- Ow!
- Ow! No! No!

356
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,710
- Knock it off! Stop it!
- How did you diagnose
that nerve?

357
00:21:02,812 --> 00:21:05,345
Because I've never
heard of that condition.

358
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:08,348
I remembered an article
from the British journal of ENT.

359
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:13,938
It was issue 47,
page 19, from 1964.

360
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,740
- A photographic memory.
- Dude. Lexipedia.

361
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,793
- Oh, I hate you.
- Don't hate me. I can help you.

362
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,950
Chief, what's going
on with the flood?

363
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:29,186
It's not a flood,
Bailey. It's a pipe that...

364
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,768
It's minor, OK? Not to worry.

365
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,936
Aren't you headed to surgery?

366
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,526
Yes, sir.

367
00:21:36,812 --> 00:21:38,879
Chief, a few months ago

368
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:42,282
little Tuck flushed one of his
action figures down the toilet.

369
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,446
I thought it was
no big deal. Minor.

370
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,987
But then I came
home to a kitchen

371
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:49,840
filled with several
inches of poop water.

372
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:54,061
- Poop water?
- In my kitchen, sir.

373
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:59,466
Thank you, Dr. Bailey,
but I have this under control.

374
00:22:00,136 --> 00:22:01,568
Yes, sir.

375
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,589
Poop water.

376
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:09,610
Hey. Hey. So apparently
there's some kind of leak.

377
00:22:09,712 --> 00:22:12,512
Chief wants me to move the
pre-op patients to the clinic.

378
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:14,231
Who's free to help me...? Ow!

379
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,867
- What the hell?
- Not a high pain threshold?

380
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:19,670
You know what? Throw
him out. Not me, just him.

381
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:22,434
- She likes me more.
- I bake for everyone
and I clean.

382
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,302
The only thing you
bring to the house is filth.

383
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:28,646
What would you prefer,
chocolate cake or an STD?

384
00:22:29,732 --> 00:22:31,799
Water!

385
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:34,368
- Get out, get out.
- Where is this coming from?

386
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,637
- Get the Chief.
- Let's keep going.

387
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:42,475
Post-ops to rooms 2415.

388
00:22:42,577 --> 00:22:45,412
Pre-ops to rooms 2233, 4 and 5.

389
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:47,747
- Overflow goes into the clinic.
- OK.

390
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,150
Chief!

391
00:22:49,252 --> 00:22:51,352
I got everything
under control up here.

392
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:54,488
I need you to oversee Stevens
with the pre-ops in the clinic.

393
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,875
Sir, maybe we need to shut down.

394
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:00,594
Just send the patients to
Mercy West, Seattle Pres.

395
00:23:00,696 --> 00:23:03,881
They can repair the pipe. We'll
be up and running in no time.

396
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:06,250
I am sending our
patients to dry ground.

397
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:07,901
I closed all but two ORs.

398
00:23:08,004 --> 00:23:11,672
Maintenance has isolated the
broken pipe, so thank you, Dr. Bailey.

399
00:23:11,774 --> 00:23:15,042
When I say I've got it under
control that's what I mean.

400
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:18,712
Sir, they may have isolated
it, but a lot of water got out.

401
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:22,082
- I'm just saying...
- Dr. Bailey, clinic now!

402
00:23:25,687 --> 00:23:28,505
Yes, sir. On my way.

403
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,408
Slow down!

404
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:37,998
OK, what next?

405
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,117
Wait. Are you sure
you have time for this?

406
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:42,430
I want you to get
to take your test.

407
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,214
- Thank you.
- Grey.

408
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:48,826
Despite your
unfortunate taste in men,

409
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,589
turns out you're
not entirely useless.

410
00:23:50,613 --> 00:23:53,780
Mr. Patmore's condition
is extremely rare...

411
00:23:53,883 --> 00:23:56,116
and you nailed it.

412
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:58,402
You can scrub in.

413
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:01,271
Now? You're doing the
surgery now, with the flood?

414
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:04,742
Flood's contained. Our man's
been in pain for seven years.

415
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:06,444
See you in surgery.

416
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:09,396
I can't. I'm sorry. Um...

417
00:24:09,498 --> 00:24:14,117
But I'm really busy helping
the Chief... the Chief's intern.

418
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,720
I... Thank you, but
maybe next time?

419
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:19,673
No, Lassie, there
won't be a next time.

420
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:23,076
Pathetic.

421
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:25,279
Mr. Patmore, I'm
gonna draw some blood

422
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:28,715
and place a topical decongestant
before I take you to surgery.

423
00:24:28,817 --> 00:24:30,284
Absolutely, of course.

424
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:33,613
How's your pain level now?

425
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,506
Eight.

426
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:37,841
It's always at eight.

427
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,994
Oh. It looked like
you had some relief.

428
00:24:42,765 --> 00:24:44,765
I've spent seven years.

429
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:47,317
I've seen 39 doctors.

430
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:52,106
I've tried every kind of
painkiller and nothing helps.

431
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:55,109
I've had doctors tell
me it's my imagination...

432
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:58,628
that I'm crazy.

433
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,797
Called me a drug addict.

434
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:09,056
My wife died last year.

435
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:15,261
After spending years carting
me around to doctor after doctor,

436
00:25:15,363 --> 00:25:18,749
test after test, she died.

437
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,620
She was my best friend.

438
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,992
She was my favorite
person in the...

439
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:30,494
And she died.

440
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:35,015
But I couldn't feel it.

441
00:25:38,354 --> 00:25:39,837
I couldn't feel that pain

442
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:43,624
because I was so completely
occupied with this one.

443
00:25:46,195 --> 00:25:49,763
Now I finally know what's
wrong and Dr. Sloan is gonna fix it

444
00:25:49,865 --> 00:25:54,985
so you're right, you're right,
that I'm feeling some relief.

445
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,175
OK, let's get your blood drawn.

446
00:26:04,914 --> 00:26:07,447
I'm not gonna do it. I'm
not gonna have surgery.

447
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,683
It's just gonna hurt.

448
00:26:09,785 --> 00:26:12,402
She's gonna slice me in
half and probably kill me.

449
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:16,489
If she doesn't kill me,
it'll just hurt like hell.

450
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:19,593
Probably get infected and
hurt worse. I'm not gonna do it.

451
00:26:19,695 --> 00:26:23,664
I get that you're scared, but if you
want to live you need the surgery.

452
00:26:23,766 --> 00:26:26,800
If I want to live? Have you
been paying any attention?

453
00:26:33,275 --> 00:26:36,243
My girlfriend had a hysterical
pregnancy and went nuts,

454
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:39,558
cut her wrists while I was in the
next room, had to be committed.

455
00:26:39,582 --> 00:26:41,932
Now my roommate's
planning to make me move.

456
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:43,411
I have no money for a deposit.

457
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,936
Chances are next
week I'm homeless.

458
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,508
You're making stuff up
to make me feel better?

459
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,844
You must have
something to live for.

460
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,031
Or even just the
possibility of something.

461
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,385
This girl at the grocery store.

462
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:06,657
I keep meaning to say hello.

463
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:10,661
Instead I... just keep
asking her about the produce.

464
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:12,896
All right. So you
get the surgery.

465
00:27:12,981 --> 00:27:16,984
'Cause chances are your
luck's gonna turn around.

466
00:27:17,086 --> 00:27:20,720
It's science. It's
the law of averages.

467
00:27:20,822 --> 00:27:22,689
It's gonna turn around.

468
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:26,576
And when it does, you say hello.

469
00:27:28,664 --> 00:27:30,347
I say hello.

470
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:47,347
Chips?

471
00:27:48,483 --> 00:27:49,682
Chocolate?

472
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,087
Thanks.

473
00:28:00,328 --> 00:28:04,364
- What?
- You're not a terrible person.

474
00:28:04,466 --> 00:28:07,518
- OK.
- I know we don't see
eye to eye, but...

475
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:12,188
I found this really
great apartment.

476
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:16,025
It's across the street from
the hospital, has great light.

477
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,878
I know you can afford
it and it's Burke-free.

478
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:22,849
It must be kind of awful
living in his old place.

479
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,652
Think about it.

480
00:28:36,431 --> 00:28:40,484
You can open that retractor up
more if you want to get a better look.

481
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:43,086
Just make sure you keep
the small bowel inside.

482
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,138
I want to avoid a post-op ileus.

483
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,225
We better. He thinks there's a
dark cloud following him around.

484
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,061
That sounds overly dramatic.

485
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:55,615
What's that?

486
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,085
- What's...?
- What the hell?

487
00:29:03,258 --> 00:29:05,975
Hey, hey. Hey, move! Move!

488
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,944
- Move the patient!
- What?

489
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,779
Move the patient!

490
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:12,699
Move the patient!

491
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:14,818
Move the patient!

492
00:29:16,304 --> 00:29:19,088
Oh, my God!

493
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,428
Is everyone OK?
How's our patient?

494
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,297
- Vitals holding stable.
- Irrigation, please.

495
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:30,467
- How can I help?
- Find Chief,
tell him what happened.

496
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:31,885
God, we need a new OR.

497
00:29:31,987 --> 00:29:34,854
Shut down the other ORs
except for this one and Dr. Sloan's.

498
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:38,125
Karev, go to Sloan. He just
got started, maybe he can close.

499
00:29:38,227 --> 00:29:41,160
I need everybody's help.
Get ready to move Mr. O'Brien.

500
00:29:41,263 --> 00:29:44,982
- What do I tell Sloan?
- Tell him the damn sky
is falling!

501
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:47,451
Nasal speculum and lidocaine.

502
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,972
Larger speculum,
another lidocaine.

503
00:29:53,074 --> 00:29:55,475
- You're just watching?
- I'm a pain specialist

504
00:29:55,577 --> 00:29:59,463
and I would've missed this
thing. So yes, I'm gonna watch.

505
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:05,768
Don't ever use me again
to try and influence her.

506
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:08,405
You and I are not Team Meredith.

507
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:10,240
We need the OR.

508
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,626
We need the OR!

509
00:30:14,096 --> 00:30:15,596
On a patient?

510
00:30:15,698 --> 00:30:18,798
- Yes, sir.
- Collapsed?

511
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:24,003
Your staff wasn't hurt, but the
patient's abdomen was open.

512
00:30:24,106 --> 00:30:26,540
He's stable, as far as I know.

513
00:30:39,454 --> 00:30:40,854
Dr. Bailey, spread the word.

514
00:30:40,956 --> 00:30:42,500
We are closing
the surgical floor

515
00:30:42,524 --> 00:30:44,684
and shipping
patients to Mercy West

516
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,976
- and Seattle Presbyterian.
- Yes, sir.

517
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,046
And Dr. Bailey...

518
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,968
- Try not to gloat
on the way out.
- No gloating, sir.

519
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,207
Anybody see any more
damage? Any bleeding?

520
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:03,844
No bleeding. I cleared
the lower left quadrant.

521
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:05,457
Give me the pulse irrigator.

522
00:31:05,481 --> 00:31:07,914
Dr. Hahn, take a
look at this right here.

523
00:31:08,016 --> 00:31:10,850
The pancreas. Is that
damage from the debris?

524
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,969
No, no.

525
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:15,288
That's a tumor.

526
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,707
Oh, son of a bitch.

527
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,245
You're the shrink, right?

528
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,131
- Yeah.
- Well, you can't let her quit.

529
00:31:26,234 --> 00:31:28,702
Let me guess. Cristina.

530
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:32,172
She talks? Whatever.

531
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:34,741
Um, you can't let her
quit because I'm no longer

532
00:31:34,843 --> 00:31:37,377
allowed an opinion.
I'm being supportive.

533
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:40,497
So you're my last hope.

534
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:43,844
It's your job to have
an opinion, right?

535
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:46,253
You're paid to have an opinion?

536
00:31:46,355 --> 00:31:49,305
- That's right.
- OK. So, um...

537
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,410
She lives her life on an eight.

538
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:57,881
Her pain. On any given
day, she lives at an eight,

539
00:31:57,983 --> 00:31:59,650
and he doesn't get that.

540
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:03,019
I mean, he moves in and expects
her to move her roommates out?

541
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:06,055
Which goes to show you how
completely he doesn't get her

542
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:07,391
because she needs them.

543
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:09,626
So you need to tell her
not to move them out.

544
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,539
It's not gonna work
out in the long run.

545
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:13,830
She thinks that she's
happy, she's not.

546
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,215

- Actually, not so OK.

577
00:34:18,073 --> 00:34:20,156
The flood weakened
the ceiling in the OR.

578
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:25,095
The ceiling collapsed and several
fragments landed inside your incision.

579
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:28,114
'Cause of the ceiling thing we
had to explore your abdomen

580
00:34:28,217 --> 00:34:30,616
more thoroughly than
we normally would have.

581
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,854
As a result we found a
malignant tumor on your pancreas.

582
00:34:33,956 --> 00:34:35,489
Cancer?

583
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:39,676
You found cancer?

584
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:44,464
Whoa, wait. Listen. Listen,
man, 'cause here's the thing.

585
00:34:44,566 --> 00:34:46,216
We took it out,
sent it to pathology.

586
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:49,386
- It was only stage one.
- Only stage one.

587
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:51,755
We never find pancreatic
tumors so early.

588
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:55,691
They're almost always a death
sentence by the time they're diagnosed.

589
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,860
But not for you.

590
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:01,014
We took the tumor, the
whole thing. We took it out.

591
00:35:01,116 --> 00:35:03,516
You won't even need chemo.

592
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:07,337

00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,473
Hello.

<i>♪ I feel so damn good

679
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,622
<i>We can sew the flesh.</i>

00:40:11,392 --> 00:40:12,892
<i>Repair the damage.</i>

681
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:15,911
<i>Ease the pain.</i>

682
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:19,132

They're my family.

685
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:28,240
You can't just assume I'm
gonna kick my family out,

686
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:31,360
and you don't get to announce
it to them and ambush me.

687
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:35,248
And you definitely don't get to
try to get Cristina on your side.

688
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,718
They're my family, they're
who I have. You and them.

- I'd like to
talk about it again,

694
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:57,553
when you're ready.
But for now, OK.

00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:17,969
yes.

701
00:41:17,993 --> 00:41:19,759
<i>There's no science,</i>

702
00:41:19,861 --> 00:41:22,762

704
00:41:26,101 --> 00:41:27,466

705
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,436
<i>there's nothing worse

706
00:41:30,538 --> 00:41:33,706
Are you sure about this,
sir? You've had a long day.

707
00:41:34,943 --> 00:41:38,044
It's one thing to stand on
a stage and give a speech.

708
00:41:38,146 --> 00:41:40,329
But if I want our teaching
program to be the best,

709
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:44,700
and I do, it starts here.

710
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:47,136
And it starts with me.

711
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:50,322
I can't do anything
about the flood.

712
00:41:51,626 --> 00:41:54,026
But I can give you
your shot, O'Malley.

713
00:41:54,128 --> 00:41:55,545
You earned it.

714
00:41:55,647 --> 00:41:57,729
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.

715
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,285
OK.

716
00:42:04,205 --> 00:42:06,072
You get three hours.

717
00:42:06,874 --> 00:42:09,275
Go.
