Meredith Grey narrates about intimacy, describing it as both desired and feared, difficult to live with, and impossible to live without. She reflects on the complications of relatives, romance, and roommates. Early in the morning, Meredith’s roommate (likely Izzie or George) tries to get her attention, and Izzie asks if someone is using her toothbrush, highlighting the awkwardness of their living situation. Meredith muses about the inescapable aspects of life and the things one would rather not know.

In the shared house, Izzie greets a cat, and George complains about the lack of privacy, referencing the women parading in their underwear while he’s naked in the shower. Izzie asks George to buy tampons, but he refuses, insisting he doesn’t buy “girl products.” Izzie is unfazed by the nudity, telling George to get used to it. Meredith adds “tampons” to the shopping list, and Izzie reminds George it’s his turn to shop. George protests, but Izzie and Meredith are dismissive, and Izzie teases George by flaunting her underwear.

At the hospital, Meredith, following Dr. Bailey’s instructions, is reminded to be polite and considerate with patients during pre-rounds. Bailey explains that making patients comfortable is crucial, as it helps the interns gather vital information for rounds. Dr. Bailey warns that making the resident look bad will result in punishment. She orders the interns to complete pre-rounds by 5:30 a.m.

Alex Karev greets Izzie with a mocking “Dr. Model,” referencing her past as a lingerie model. Izzie retorts, and Cristina Yang hopes for better patients, complaining about her previous day’s assignments. The interns discuss their early arrival times, with Cristina boasting about being there at 4 a.m. Alex implies that Cristina is only ambitious because she’s not involved with an attending, a dig at Meredith’s rumored relationship with Dr. Shepherd. Meredith denies any inappropriate relationship.

Dr. Shepherd arrives early and offers to buy Meredith breakfast, but she declines, saying she’s already eaten. Cristina, overhearing, makes sarcastic remarks about Meredith’s breakfast habits and insists on maintaining professionalism, not wanting to be seen with Meredith in the hospital due to the rumors about Meredith and Shepherd.

Cristina meets Elizabeth Fallon, a former scrub nurse now admitted with pancreatic cancer. Fallon recognizes Cristina’s ambition and calls her out for trying to secure a spot in her surgery. Fallon insists on being called “Nurse Fallon” and calls Cristina “Christina.” Cristina then checks on Mr. Humphrey, who is resistant to being examined by Izzie after recognizing her from a lingerie ad. He demands another doctor, making Izzie uncomfortable.

Back at the house, the roommates debate setting rules about nudity and boundaries. Cristina asks George if he has a crush on Izzie, which he denies, clarifying that he’s attracted to someone else. The conversation is interrupted when Dr. Bailey orders O'Malley and Grey to assist Dr. Shepherd in trauma.

The trauma case involves Jorge Cruz, who has accidentally shot seven nails into his skull with a nail gun. He is conscious but blind. The team discusses the risks and options for imaging, ultimately deciding on using X-rays and a C-Arm due to the metal in Jorge’s head. Jorge’s wife, Sona, arrives, upset with him for using the nail gun, and his partner Javi shares Jorge’s recent symptoms with Dr. Shepherd.

Cristina presents Nurse Fallon’s case to Dr. Burke, hoping to assist in a Whipple procedure. Liz, a scrub nurse, gossips about Cristina’s ambition and notes that Meredith is Ellis Grey’s daughter. Dr. Burke assigns Meredith to Fallon’s case, thinking she and Liz might have something to talk about, but Liz doubts it, having never met Meredith despite working with Ellis for 18 years.

Izzie takes Jorge’s history, learning about his headaches and his wife’s dislike of guns. The interns research nail gun injuries, discovering 23 documented cases. Alex teases George about living with women who walk around in their underwear, and George awkwardly tries to explain their relationship as not being like siblings.

Dr. Shepherd prepares for Mr. Humphrey’s prostate biopsy, but Mr. Humphrey refuses to let Izzie participate due to her modeling past. Cristina and Alex discuss the situation, and Cristina later confronts Izzie about hiding in the hallway. Cristina tells Izzie to act like a doctor and do her job, regardless of the patient’s attitude.

Dr. Shepherd and Dr. Bailey discuss Jorge’s case, considering possible causes for his fall, including a tumor. Meredith, in a teaching moment, summarizes the key risks in removing the nails from Jorge’s head. The team prepares for the delicate surgery, and Dr. Webber jokingly refers to Izzie as “Dr. Bethany Whisperer,” referencing her modeling alias.

A patient’s husband reminisces about his wife’s love for the color red, sharing a memory about her running through a field of red poppies. Dr. Shepherd discusses Mr. Humphrey’s prognosis, suggesting a radical prostatectomy with a good chance for a normal sex life. The older patient prefers a more conservative approach, and Dr. Burke jokes about another surgeon’s reputation for not sparing nerves.

During Jorge’s surgery, Dr. Bailey explains the importance of removing the nails at the correct angle to avoid further damage. The interns observe, and Alex comments on the X-rays. Cristina and George discuss their hopes for getting to assist in a Whipple procedure. Izzie and George have another awkward exchange about tampons and gender roles.

Meredith and Cristina discuss the importance of remembering patients’ names versus just their surgeries. Dr. Shepherd adds that some surgeons distance themselves to avoid personal entanglements. Liz’s husband visits her, and the interns and nurses check on her, exchanging friendly banter.

After Jorge’s surgery, the team waits to see if his vision will return. Cristina checks with Dr. Burke about scheduling the Whipple for Fallon, but Burke wants to wait for more lab results. He instructs Cristina to stick with Fallon, and Cristina confirms she is on call.

Later, Liz Fallon and Meredith have a conversation about Ellis Grey. Liz reminisces about Ellis’s work ethic and questions Meredith about her mother’s whereabouts. Meredith lies, saying Ellis is traveling and not practicing, and Liz notes that doesn’t sound like her. The conversation reveals Ellis is actually in a nursing home with early-onset Alzheimer’s, a secret Meredith keeps from most people.

At home, Izzie and George argue again about the tampons, with Izzie insisting George needs to get over his discomfort with women’s issues. George protests that he’s not their sister.

The next morning, the roommates discuss breakfast, and Izzie checks on Jorge, who is awake. Elizabeth Fallon asks Jorge to identify the color of her dress, and he confidently answers, showing some memory has returned.

Cristina is reprimanded for waking a patient abruptly and complains about being tired from being on call. Dr. Burke tells her not to feel sorry for herself, emphasizing that this is the life of a surgeon. Sona and Jorge joke about his breakfast preferences, and Meredith prepares Jorge for an MRI to check for residual bleeding.

Izzie confronts Mr. Humphrey about his refusal to let her treat him, asserting her qualifications as a doctor and demanding respect. Mr. Humphrey admits he fantasized about her modeling photo and doesn’t want her to witness his emasculation during surgery.

Meredith and Elizabeth Fallon discuss Fallon’s worsening labs and the lack of progress. Meredith pushes for the Whipple surgery, but Fallon is evasive, and Meredith accuses her of never intending to operate. Cristina and Meredith discover Jorge has a tumor in the hypothalamus, and they discuss treatment options with his family: surgery with a risk of memory loss or less invasive radiation with a shorter life expectancy.

Richard Webber tells Meredith that his mother remembers Ellis Grey, and Meredith confirms Ellis’s diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer’s to Cristina, explaining why she keeps it secret. Cristina calls Ellis a “bitch” for her workaholic ways, and Izzie reflects on Ellis’s dedication to the hospital.

Cristina expresses her frustration about the attention Izzie gets for her looks, and Izzie downplays it as makeup and retouching. Cristina jokes that if she looked like Izzie, she’d walk around naked all the time.

Dr. Bailey scolds the interns for not answering their pages promptly. Sona, Jorge’s wife, struggles with the decision about his surgery, ultimately supporting whatever Jorge wants, even if it means years of hardship for her. Izzie apologizes for overstepping.

During a code, Liz Fallon’s condition deteriorates. Cristina and others attempt to resuscitate her, but she is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the team is forced to let her go. Izzie and Alex discuss the earlier argument about emasculation, and Izzie apologizes.

In surgery, Izzie stands up to Dr. Victor, insisting on saving Mr. Humphrey’s nerves to preserve his quality of life, as he requested. Dr. Bailey supports Izzie’s advocacy for the patient’s wishes, and the team proceeds with the nerve-sparing approach.

Meredith reflects on the lack of a rule book for intimacy and the need to define boundaries for oneself. At home, Meredith warns Izzie not to use her toothbrush, and Izzie assures her she isn’t. Meredith concludes that the rules of intimacy are personal, and the episode ends with Izzie wishing Meredith good night.
