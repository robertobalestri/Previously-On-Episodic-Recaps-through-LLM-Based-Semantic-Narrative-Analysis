The episode opens with Meredith Grey reflecting on the nature of intimacy, describing it as both desired and feared, difficult to live with, and impossible to live without. She muses on how intimacy is tied to life’s “three Rs”: relatives, romance, and roommates, setting the thematic tone for the episode.

Early in the morning, Meredith and her roommates, Izzie Stevens and George O’Malley, navigate the awkwardness of sharing a house. George is uncomfortable with Izzie and Meredith walking around in their underwear and is frustrated when asked to buy tampons, insisting that as a man, he doesn’t buy “girl products.” Izzie teases George, telling him to look at her in her underwear and to get used to it, while Cristina Yang jokes about the situation. The roommates debate setting house rules, but the conversation reveals George’s crush on one of the women, which he denies when confronted.

At the hospital, Dr. Miranda Bailey instructs Meredith and George on how to interact with patients during pre-rounds, emphasizing the importance of making patients feel comfortable so they’ll share information that can be relayed to the attending. Bailey is strict, demanding pre-rounds be completed by 5:30 a.m.

The interns gather, discussing their hopes for better patient assignments. Izzie complains about her previous day’s patients, while Cristina is determined to get a good surgical case. Alex Karev makes crude jokes about Izzie’s modeling past, calling her “Dr. Model,” and teases her about her tattoos. The group’s banter is interrupted by Dr. Bailey, who assigns patients and tasks.

Cristina visits Nurse Elizabeth Fallon, a former scrub nurse at the hospital now admitted with pancreatic cancer. Fallon recognizes Cristina’s ambition and calls out her attempts to secure a spot in surgery. Fallon insists on being called “Nurse Fallon” and demonstrates her knowledge of hospital politics.

Izzie attempts to examine Mr. Humphrey, a patient scheduled for a prostate biopsy, but he refuses her care after recognizing her from a lingerie ad. He demands another doctor, making Izzie feel uncomfortable and unwelcome.

Meanwhile, Meredith, George, and Alex respond to a trauma case: Jorge Cruz, who has accidentally shot seven nails into his head with a nail gun. Jorge is conscious but blind, and his wife Sona arrives, scolding him for his carelessness. The team discusses the rarity of such cases and the risks involved in removing the nails, especially since the CT scanner is down. Dr. Derek Shepherd and Dr. Preston Burke debate the best imaging and surgical approach, ultimately deciding to use X-rays and a C-Arm.

Cristina presents Nurse Fallon’s case to Dr. Burke, hoping to assist in a Whipple procedure for her pancreatic cancer. However, Burke assigns the case to Meredith, noting Fallon’s history with Meredith’s mother, Ellis Grey. Fallon reveals she never met Meredith despite working with Ellis for 18 years.

The interns research Jorge Cruz’s case, learning that accidental nail gun injuries to the head are rare but survivable if managed quickly. They also discuss the dynamics of their living situation, with Alex probing George about living with two attractive women. George insists he doesn’t see them as sisters, but the conversation highlights his discomfort.

Izzie continues to struggle with Mr. Humphrey, who refuses her participation in his care due to her modeling past. Izzie is frustrated but determined to prove herself as a capable doctor, not just a model.

Meredith and Bailey discuss Izzie’s situation, with Bailey reminding Meredith that being a doctor means not shying away from difficult situations. Izzie, meanwhile, vents to her friends about being objectified and not taken seriously.

The surgical team prepares for Jorge Cruz’s operation. Dr. Shepherd explains the delicate process of removing the nails without causing further damage, especially to the optic nerve. The surgery is successful, but Jorge’s vision prognosis remains uncertain.

Meredith checks on Nurse Fallon, whose condition is worsening. Meredith advocates for more aggressive treatment, but Burke wants to wait for biopsy results. Fallon’s labs deteriorate, and Meredith pushes for the Whipple surgery, but Burke remains cautious.

Later, Meredith visits her mother, Ellis Grey, who is suffering from early-onset Alzheimer’s and living in a nursing home. Meredith tries to connect with Ellis by showing her old family photos, but Ellis is confused and forgetful, highlighting the emotional distance between them.

Back at the hospital, the interns gather in the locker room, where Alex and George continue to tease Izzie about her modeling. Izzie confronts them, stripping down to show her tattoos and body, and asserts her qualifications as a doctor, reminding them that she is debt-free thanks to her modeling work.

Jorge Cruz’s family faces a difficult decision: whether to remove his brain tumor surgically, risking his memory and personality, or to opt for less invasive treatment that would give him fewer years to live. Sona, his wife, struggles with the prospect of losing the man she loves, even if he survives physically. Meredith tries to help her understand the implications, but Sona insists she will support Jorge’s wishes, even if it means caring for a husband who may not remember her.

Nurse Fallon’s condition rapidly declines. Despite the interns’ efforts, she is DNR (do not resuscitate), and they are forced to let her go. Meredith calls the time of death.

In the aftermath, the interns reflect on the day’s events. Izzie and Cristina discuss the challenges of being women in medicine and the objectification Izzie faces. Meredith and Cristina reconcile after earlier tension, and Izzie stands up for herself in surgery, insisting on preserving Mr. Humphrey’s nerves during his prostatectomy to maintain his quality of life.

The episode closes with Meredith’s voiceover, reflecting on the lack of clear rules for intimacy and the need to define boundaries for oneself. The roommates return home, with George still uncomfortable about buying tampons, and the group settling in for the night, having grown a little closer through the day’s trials.
