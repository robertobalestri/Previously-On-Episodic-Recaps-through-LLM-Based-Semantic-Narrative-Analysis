The episode opens with Meredith Grey narrating about intimacy, describing it as both desired and feared, difficult to live with, and impossible to live without. She reflects on how intimacy is tied to life's "three Rs": relatives, romance, and roommates.

Early in the morning, Meredith and her roommates, George O'Malley and Izzie Stevens, navigate the awkwardness of sharing a house. George is uncomfortable with Izzie and Meredith walking around in their underwear while he’s naked in the shower. Izzie is unfazed, teasing George and telling him to get used to it. The roommates argue about household responsibilities, including buying tampons, which George refuses to do, insisting he’s a man and doesn’t buy girl products.

At the hospital, Cristina Yang instructs the interns on how to conduct pre-rounds, emphasizing the importance of bedside manner and making residents look good to avoid being tortured. Cristina, Izzie, and Meredith discuss their hopes for interesting cases that day, with Cristina hoping to scrub in on a Whipple procedure for a patient with pancreatic cancer, Elizabeth Fallon, a former scrub nurse at the hospital.

Cristina meets Nurse Fallon, who immediately recognizes Cristina’s ambition and calls her out for trying to get assigned to her surgery. Fallon insists on being called Nurse Fallon and calls Cristina "Christina." Meanwhile, Izzie tries to examine Mr. Humphrey, a patient scheduled for a prostate biopsy, but he refuses to let her, preferring Dr. Bailey or Dr. Victor.

George continues to struggle with the roommate situation, asking Meredith if she thinks he has a crush on Izzie, which he denies, saying he’s attracted to someone else. Their conversation is interrupted when Dr. Bailey pages George and Meredith to assist Dr. Shepherd in trauma.

The trauma patient, Jorge Cruz, has fallen down stairs while holding a nail gun, resulting in seven nails embedded in his skull. The team, including Meredith, George, Izzie, Alex Karev, and Derek Shepherd, work together to stabilize Jorge, who is conscious but blind. The CT scanner is down, so they opt for X-rays and a C-Arm insertion to guide the removal of the nails. Jorge’s wife, Sona, arrives, and the team gathers his medical history, learning he’s had headaches and dizziness for months.

Meanwhile, Dr. Bailey presents Nurse Fallon’s case to the attending physicians. Cristina is disappointed when she learns Meredith will be assigned to Fallon instead of her. Fallon reveals she was Ellis Grey’s scrub nurse for 18 years but never met Meredith, Ellis’s daughter.

In the locker room, Alex Karev questions George about living with Meredith and Izzie, asking if they walk around in sexy underwear and if it’s like living with sisters. George awkwardly denies it, saying it’s not like that.

Cristina and Izzie research nail gun injuries to the head, finding 23 documented cases, most accidental. The team prepares for Jorge’s surgery, discussing the risks of bleeding and infection and the importance of removing the nails at the exact angle they entered.

During rounds, Dr. Burke assigns Cristina to get a history from Jorge before scrubbing in. Jorge’s wife Sona scolds him for the accident, and the team continues to prepare for surgery. The surgery is successful, and the team waits to see if Jorge’s vision will return.

Nurse Fallon’s condition worsens, and her labs show elevated liver enzymes and worsening jaundice. Cristina and Izzie push Dr. Burke to schedule the Whipple procedure, but he wants to wait for biopsy results. Dr. Bailey suspects Burke never intended to operate, believing Fallon was admitted to die in the hospital where she spent her career.

Meredith learns from Richard Webber that her mother, Ellis Grey, is in a nursing home with early-onset Alzheimer’s and doesn’t want anyone to know. Richard is the only person Ellis allows to visit her.

Izzie faces ridicule from other interns and staff after her lingerie modeling photos appear in a magazine. She confronts Mr. Humphrey, who admits he fantasized about her as a model and doesn’t want her present during his emasculating surgery. Izzie asserts her professionalism and demands to be treated as a doctor.

Cristina and Izzie discuss Fallon’s worsening condition, with Cristina frustrated that the hospital is just letting her die. Meredith argues that sometimes doing everything can be worse than doing nothing, while Cristina insists she’d want doctors to fight for her life until the end.

In the operating room, Izzie and Cristina advocate for saving Mr. Humphrey’s nerves during his prostatectomy, arguing that preserving his chance at a normal sex life is important. Dr. Victor, initially resistant, relents and lets Izzie take over the surgery. Dr. Bailey warns Izzie and Cristina that she’ll report them to Richard Webber, but ultimately supports their decision to give the patient what he wants.

Jorge Cruz faces a difficult decision about his brain tumor. Derek Shepherd explains the options: removing the tumor could give him five to ten good years but risks memory and personality loss; focused radiation would preserve his identity but only offer three to five years. Sona insists the choice is Jorge’s, even if it means ten bad years for her, because she’ll remember for both of them.

Nurse Fallon’s condition deteriorates, and despite efforts to resuscitate her, she dies. The team calls her time of death.

The episode ends with Meredith reflecting on intimacy and the lack of a rule book for it. She muses that perhaps the rules of intimacy are something each person must define for themselves. The roommates continue their banter at home, with Meredith warning them not to use her toothbrush. The episode closes with Meredith wishing the patient good night.

Throughout the episode, the characters grapple with professional boundaries, personal relationships, and the emotional complexities of medicine, highlighting the challenges of intimacy in both their personal and professional lives.
