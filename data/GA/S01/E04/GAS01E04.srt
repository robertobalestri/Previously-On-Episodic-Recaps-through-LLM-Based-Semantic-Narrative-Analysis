1
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:07,384
Intimacy is a four-syllable word for here are my heart and soul.

2
00:00:07,445 --> 00:00:10,948
Please grind them into hamburger and enjoy.

3
00:00:10,968 --> 00:00:14,612
It's both desired and feared.

4
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:17,173
Difficult to live with.

5
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:18,515
Excuse me.

6
00:00:19,115 --> 00:00:19,777
Excuse me.

7
00:00:20,397 --> 00:00:21,998
And impossible to live without.

8
00:00:22,018 --> 00:00:27,625
Is that my toothbrush?

9
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:43,905
Intimacy also comes attached to life's three Rs.

10
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:48,811
Relatives, romance, and roommates.

11
00:00:51,454 --> 00:00:51,835
Copy.

12
00:00:51,975 --> 00:00:55,979
There are some things you can't escape.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,662
And other things you just don't want to know.

14
00:00:59,344 --> 00:01:00,344
Hello, kitty.

15
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:06,516
You don't understand.

16
00:01:06,557 --> 00:01:08,099
Me gonads, you ovaries.

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,001
Oh, that reminds me.

18
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:11,322
We are out of tampons.

19
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:14,908
You're parading through the bathroom in your underwear when I'm naked in the shower.

20
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:16,230
Can you add it to your list, please?

21
00:01:16,269 --> 00:01:16,510
What?

22
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:17,450
Tampons.

23
00:01:17,992 --> 00:01:18,733
It's to the list.

24
00:01:18,753 --> 00:01:19,394
It's your turn.

25
00:01:19,974 --> 00:01:21,376
I am a man.

26
00:01:22,037 --> 00:01:23,939
I don't buy girl products.

27
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:28,144
I don't want you walking in while I'm in the shower, and I don't want to see you in your underwear.

28
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:29,566
It doesn't bother me, okay?

29
00:01:29,647 --> 00:01:31,069
Look at me in my underwear, George.

30
00:01:31,108 --> 00:01:31,769
Take your time.

31
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,251
It's no big deal.

32
00:01:35,492 --> 00:01:38,516
You are the first person they see in the morning.

33
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,736
You say please.

34
00:01:39,796 --> 00:01:40,718
You say thank you.

35
00:01:40,778 --> 00:01:43,381
You apologize for waking them up.

36
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,302
You make them feel good about you.

37
00:01:45,582 --> 00:01:46,765
Why is that important?

38
00:01:46,984 --> 00:01:49,628
Because then they'll talk to you and tell you what's wrong.

39
00:01:49,987 --> 00:01:51,328
Why is that important?

40
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,992
Because then you can tell your attending what they need to know during rounds.

41
00:01:55,112 --> 00:01:56,915
And why is that important?

42
00:01:57,314 --> 00:02:03,762
Because if you make your resident look bad, she'll torture you until you beg for your mama.

43
00:02:03,742 --> 00:02:04,825
Now, get out there.

44
00:02:04,864 --> 00:02:07,371
I want pre-rounds done by 5.30 a.m.

45
00:02:08,615 --> 00:02:09,437
Morning, Dr. Model.

46
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:10,980
Dr. Evil Swan.

47
00:02:11,322 --> 00:02:12,504
Ooh.

48
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:13,287
Nice tat.

49
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:15,393
They ever brush that off for the catalogs?

50
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:16,536
I don't know.

51
00:02:17,056 --> 00:02:18,918
What do they do for the 666 on your skull?

52
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:21,520
I'd better get good patients today.

53
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,843
Yesterday, I had two guys with colostomies who needed dressing changes every 15 minutes.

54
00:02:25,903 --> 00:02:26,805
I don't want to be in surgery.

55
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:27,925
Today's my day.

56
00:02:28,486 --> 00:02:29,266
On what?

57
00:02:29,287 --> 00:02:29,907
Like I tell you.

58
00:02:29,948 --> 00:02:31,088
What do you know?

59
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:33,792
Know that I was here at 4, and you didn't get here till 4.30.

60
00:02:34,512 --> 00:02:34,832
Tell me.

61
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:36,234
No.

62
00:02:38,256 --> 00:02:40,137
I'm not the intern who's screwing and attending.

63
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:43,941
I am not screwing...

64
00:02:45,253 --> 00:02:46,014
You're here early.

65
00:02:46,156 --> 00:02:47,076
Have a quart out of me at 5.

66
00:02:47,197 --> 00:02:47,818
I'll be out at 6.

67
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:48,318
I thought I might.

68
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,822
Buy your breakfast before you round.

69
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:50,782
I've already eaten.

70
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:51,443
What would you have?

71
00:02:51,784 --> 00:02:52,526
None of your business.

72
00:02:52,926 --> 00:02:53,627
The cereal person?

73
00:02:54,188 --> 00:02:55,731
Straight out of the box, you're all fruit and fribery.

74
00:02:57,114 --> 00:02:57,495
Pancakes?

75
00:02:57,514 --> 00:02:58,235
Do you like pancakes?

76
00:02:58,355 --> 00:02:58,676
Fine.

77
00:02:58,736 --> 00:03:00,019
Leftover grilled cheese.

78
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,921
Curiosity satisfied?

79
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:02,162
That's sad.

80
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:02,883
That's pathetic.

81
00:03:03,123 --> 00:03:04,826
A good day starts with a good breakfast.

82
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:07,350
Look, I'm not being seen with you in this hospital.

83
00:03:07,632 --> 00:03:08,473
Learn it, live it.

84
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:09,675
It's unprofessional.

85
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:11,618
I think there's an attending getting to know one of his interns.

86
00:03:11,718 --> 00:03:12,781
He slept with the intern.

87
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,302
He's barely newer.

88
00:03:13,742 --> 00:03:14,765
And it should stay that way.

89
00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:15,627
You want me to be professional?

90
00:03:16,288 --> 00:03:16,990
I'll be professional.

91
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:17,912
That's what I want.

92
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:18,794
And that's what you get.

93
00:03:18,993 --> 00:03:20,417
You're going to be late for your chordotomy.

94
00:03:22,461 --> 00:03:23,864
Nice talking to you, Dr. Gray.

95
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:30,076
Anyone seen the floor chart on the new admission?

96
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,443
You always come in like that, bang the light on?

97
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:38,525
You're Elizabeth Fallon?

98
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:40,646
What does my chart say?

99
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:42,908
It says you used to be a nurse here.

100
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:44,811
A scrub nurse.

101
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:48,435
And that you have abdominal mass consistent with pancreatic cancer?

102
00:03:48,455 --> 00:03:52,018
Oh, and you are hoping they're going to give me a whipple.

103
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,822
Pancreatic duodectomy.

104
00:03:56,723 --> 00:04:02,628
This hospital sees those one, maybe, once every six months.

105
00:04:03,688 --> 00:04:05,270
That's why you got here at 4.30, huh?

106
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,192
4.

107
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:09,736
Grab my chart for anybody else could see it.

108
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:17,807
Press Dr. Burke with your pre-round exam so you'd be the logical intern for him to ask to scrub in.

109
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:21,471
I know all the tricks, Doctor.

110
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,733
Yang.

111
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:24,995
Christina Yang.

112
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:26,557
I'll call you Christina.

113
00:04:27,598 --> 00:04:29,281
You call me Nurse Fallon.

114
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:31,062
Mr. Humphrey?

115
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:34,838
Sorry to wake you.

116
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:37,684
Come on.

117
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:40,127
What time is it?

118
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:41,529
Ten after five.

119
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,673
I'm sorry, I just need to do a brief exam.

120
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:44,935
If you could sit up for one moment.

121
00:04:51,745 --> 00:04:53,148
Thanks.

122
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,173
This might be a little bit cold, so just take a deep breath.

123
00:04:56,814 --> 00:04:57,995
If you could just take a deep breath.

124
00:04:58,211 --> 00:04:59,112
You're not a doctor.

125
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,235
I'm Dr. Stevens, but you can call me Izzy.

126
00:05:01,295 --> 00:05:03,038
I'll be helping Dr. Bailey with your biopsy this morning.

127
00:05:03,059 --> 00:05:04,040
No, I don't think so, no.

128
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,423
Mr. Humphrey, this will just take a moment.

129
00:05:06,603 --> 00:05:08,867
Give me Dr. Bailey or Dr. Victor.

130
00:05:09,187 --> 00:05:10,209
I just need to do a briefing.

131
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:11,430
You don't need to do anything.

132
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:12,952
Is this you?

133
00:05:15,137 --> 00:05:15,257
Huh?

134
00:05:16,278 --> 00:05:16,639
Is this you?

135
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:19,682
It is, isn't it?

136
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:21,526
You know, get out of my room.

137
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:22,166
Mr. Humphrey.

138
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:22,987
Get out of my room.

139
00:05:29,514 --> 00:05:30,836
There need to be some rules.

140
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:31,838
So what?

141
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:34,862
We can walk around in our underwear on alternate Tuesdays?

142
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:37,625
Or you could see bras but not panties?

143
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:40,108
Or are you talking Amish rules?

144
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:44,473
Because if you think you're going to get Izzy to cover herself from neck to ankle... The amount of flesh exposed is not the point.

145
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,475
You have to do something.

146
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,137
It's your house.

147
00:05:47,517 --> 00:05:48,559
It's my mother's house.

148
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,379
Meredith.

149
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:51,973
Do you like Izzy?

150
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:53,156
Is that what this is about?

151
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:54,278
Do you have a crush on Izzy?

152
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:55,180
Izzy?

153
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,483
No, I don't like Izzy.

154
00:05:57,084 --> 00:05:57,303
Izzy?

155
00:05:57,363 --> 00:05:57,685
No.

156
00:05:58,185 --> 00:05:59,627
She's not the one I'm attracted to.

157
00:05:59,988 --> 00:06:01,411
Not the one, so there's a one.

158
00:06:01,552 --> 00:06:02,033
This is not.

159
00:06:03,735 --> 00:06:05,278
Look, there just have to be some rules.

160
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:08,384
O'Malley, Gray, get Karim, head down to trauma.

161
00:06:08,463 --> 00:06:09,386
Shepard needs you.

162
00:06:09,406 --> 00:06:10,548
Shepard's in surgery.

163
00:06:10,588 --> 00:06:12,110
He got pulled before he could start.

164
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:25,610
Those look like... Nails.

165
00:06:56,589 --> 00:07:06,247
I can't see my head.

166
00:07:06,346 --> 00:07:06,687
Oh, my god.

167
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:08,209
He's conscious, but blind.

168
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,891
Read deeply, George.

169
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:10,132
You won't pass out.

170
00:07:10,374 --> 00:07:12,877
Which four milligrams of morphine titrate up to 10?

171
00:07:13,043 --> 00:07:13,824
If you have to, you know what?

172
00:07:14,045 --> 00:07:14,726
I don't want him to move.

173
00:07:14,747 --> 00:07:15,309
I can't see.

174
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:15,891
It's okay.

175
00:07:15,911 --> 00:07:18,757
We need you to be very still, Mr. Cruz.

176
00:07:18,778 --> 00:07:19,459
Jorge Cruz.

177
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,146
He tripped and fell down a flight of stairs holding a nail gun.

178
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,069
Sick.

179
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:24,593
So now he managed an incendiary blood vessel.

180
00:07:24,613 --> 00:07:25,456
Not so much a miracle.

181
00:07:25,857 --> 00:07:27,440
Optic nerve's been affected.

182
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,641
Do you feel this on his right side?

183
00:07:30,923 --> 00:07:31,923
What's our immediate concern?

184
00:07:31,963 --> 00:07:32,504
Infection.

185
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:33,785
Right.

186
00:07:33,805 --> 00:07:35,726
I want to be pulling these nails out in the next half hour.

187
00:07:35,766 --> 00:07:36,326
I need a CT.

188
00:07:36,648 --> 00:07:37,228
CTs are down.

189
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:38,069
What?

190
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:39,470
They exchanged them out last night.

191
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,391
Computers crashed, have them back up by one.

192
00:07:41,411 --> 00:07:41,752
So typical.

193
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:42,492
So what are the options?

194
00:07:42,512 --> 00:07:43,112
An MRI.

195
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:43,372
No.

196
00:07:43,494 --> 00:07:43,834
Brilliant.

197
00:07:43,874 --> 00:07:45,095
The man's got nails in his head.

198
00:07:45,115 --> 00:07:46,656
Let's put them in a giant magnet.

199
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,117
You want films from three access points and a C-Arm insertion.

200
00:07:49,137 --> 00:07:49,459
Excellent.

201
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:51,701
You guys dig up research and find out if this has ever happened before.

202
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,360
Go.

203
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,521
My wife?

204
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:53,701
My wife?

205
00:07:53,742 --> 00:07:54,223
She's on her way.

206
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:56,685
Your life is on the way, Mr. Cruz.

207
00:07:56,665 --> 00:07:59,288
Stay with him, keep him calm, and look for changes.

208
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:03,514
I can't see.

209
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:08,500
55-year-old woman with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas has had radiation therapy to reduce the tumor load.

210
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,644
Rates for abdominal pain, 3 out of 10.

211
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:12,966
Positive, nausea, but no vomiting.

212
00:08:12,987 --> 00:08:19,355
Diarrhea, hematochesia, melina, ephedra with T-max 37.2 and stable vital signs.

213
00:08:19,636 --> 00:08:23,160
Lab significant for a total billy of 7 and elevated liver enzymes.

214
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,461
Thank you.

215
00:08:24,442 --> 00:08:25,702
Dr. Yang.

216
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:27,605
Aggressive little witch, isn't she?

217
00:08:28,086 --> 00:08:32,669
She stole my chart during pre-round so she could scrub it on my surgery.

218
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,951
She's hoping for a whipple.

219
00:08:34,412 --> 00:08:36,995
Actually, Liz, I was going to give you to Meredith Gray.

220
00:08:38,196 --> 00:08:39,037
Ellis' daughter?

221
00:08:39,798 --> 00:08:41,198
Yeah, she's an intern this year.

222
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,961
Thought you'd have something to talk about.

223
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:44,682
Oh, I doubt that.

224
00:08:46,004 --> 00:08:50,248
I was Ellis' scrub nurse for 18 years, practically lived with that woman.

225
00:08:50,327 --> 00:08:51,850
I didn't meet that daughter once.

226
00:08:54,293 --> 00:08:57,476
Well, anyway, Shepard has her on a guy with the nails in his head.

227
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,038
There's a guy with nails in his head?

228
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,280
Seven of them.

229
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:02,484
Shot himself in the head with a nail gun.

230
00:09:02,504 --> 00:09:02,823
Nail?

231
00:09:02,964 --> 00:09:03,284
Nails?

232
00:09:04,647 --> 00:09:05,307
16 pennies.

233
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,589
3 and 1 half inches long.

234
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,509
Wait, and he's still alive?

235
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:08,851
Fully conscious.

236
00:09:09,172 --> 00:09:10,594
Should be a pretty interesting surgery.

237
00:09:10,955 --> 00:09:12,736
But I guess you've got the whipple.

238
00:09:16,481 --> 00:09:19,725
I'm going to need a full blood workup and abdominal CT.

239
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,128
CT's a dime this morning.

240
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:22,807
Then an MRI.

241
00:09:22,846 --> 00:09:27,534
She needs an enema and ERCP for a stent and brush biopsy this afternoon.

242
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:29,399
Take care of her.

243
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:31,062
Liz, there's an institution around here.

244
00:09:33,605 --> 00:09:34,788
Good call, Doctor.

245
00:09:35,528 --> 00:09:41,019
Ray's got the human two by four, and you have the institution in need of an enema.

246
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,508
You'd say your health's been good recently?

247
00:09:47,517 --> 00:09:48,398
Maybe some headaches.

248
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,640
Nothing compared to now.

249
00:09:52,022 --> 00:09:57,928
Sona, that's my wife, Sona, she'll say, why you think they call it a gun, moron?

250
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,172
She hates the damn things.

251
00:10:00,852 --> 00:10:01,833
With good reason.

252
00:10:05,878 --> 00:10:06,198
Baby?

253
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:07,200
Sona.

254
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:07,419
Hey, man.

255
00:10:11,365 --> 00:10:13,187
You are in so much trouble.

256
00:10:17,621 --> 00:10:24,234
Get a history from him before you scrub in.

257
00:10:24,254 --> 00:10:24,354
Okay.

258
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:24,575
Thank you.

259
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:25,296
23.

260
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:29,344
People have been accidentally shot in the head with nails 23 times.

261
00:10:30,044 --> 00:10:32,089
One of those attempts at suicide doesn't count.

262
00:10:32,568 --> 00:10:35,394
Oh, so he pointed a nail gun at his head on purpose?

263
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:36,496
That makes me feel better.

264
00:10:37,418 --> 00:10:41,065
So, uh, Gray and Stevens really walk around in their underwear?

265
00:10:44,605 --> 00:10:45,826
I mean, not all the time.

266
00:10:45,866 --> 00:10:49,552
I mean, some of the time, you know, but not all the time.

267
00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:53,498
Sexy underwear?

268
00:10:53,518 --> 00:11:01,028
Yeah, I mean... And they just, uh, let you look at them?

269
00:11:01,048 --> 00:11:04,052
Well, uh, yeah.

270
00:11:04,072 --> 00:11:04,673
Like sisters?

271
00:11:05,294 --> 00:11:06,255
No, what?

272
00:11:06,275 --> 00:11:07,337
Not like sisters.

273
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:10,402
No, I don't think of them as sisters.

274
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,384
But they're not coming on to you.

275
00:11:13,461 --> 00:11:14,283
Not exactly.

276
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,107
They don't expect you to do anything.

277
00:11:16,148 --> 00:11:17,409
No.

278
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:19,575
But?

279
00:11:20,235 --> 00:11:20,918
Like sisters.

280
00:11:22,942 --> 00:11:33,203
Just like sisters.

281
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:33,764
Is he prepped?

282
00:11:36,934 --> 00:11:38,076
I think they're doing it right now.

283
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:38,897
You think?

284
00:11:39,577 --> 00:11:41,759
He's having a prostate biopsy.

285
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:42,320
Trust me.

286
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,701
If you'd been in there, you'd know.

287
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:49,988
OK, Mr. Humphrey, we're going to get started.

288
00:11:55,373 --> 00:11:57,174
Get her out of here.

289
00:11:57,195 --> 00:11:58,755
I want her out of here.

290
00:11:58,775 --> 00:11:59,998
Just get her out of here.

291
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:00,918
Just you go.

292
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:01,599
Now.

293
00:12:01,818 --> 00:12:03,380
Just go now.

294
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,163
Jorge, relax, relax, Mr. Humphrey.

295
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,948
Will he be able to see again?

296
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:13,751
We won't know until the nails come out.

297
00:12:14,613 --> 00:12:16,115
Did he tell you he takes photos?

298
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:19,379
Beautiful photos, says Javi.

299
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,804
I just got him a new digital camera and now he can't stop, you know?

300
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,169
He always has it out, always taking pictures of me.

301
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,533
Jorge said he's been having headaches.

302
00:12:30,052 --> 00:12:30,995
Can you tell me about them?

303
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:32,135
Have they been recent?

304
00:12:33,331 --> 00:12:35,894
Um, I'm not sure.

305
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:37,434
Maybe the last couple of months.

306
00:12:38,495 --> 00:12:41,879
Have you seen him experience any dizziness or disorientation?

307
00:12:46,663 --> 00:12:47,784
Yes, yes, I have.

308
00:12:50,548 --> 00:12:55,993
OK.

309
00:12:56,013 --> 00:12:57,855
You want to tell me what that was all about?

310
00:12:57,914 --> 00:12:59,897
Nothing.

311
00:13:00,256 --> 00:13:01,818
It was probably just crazy or something.

312
00:13:03,232 --> 00:13:04,905
Dr. Campbell to oncology.

313
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:07,586
Dr. Campbell to oncology.

314
00:13:07,628 --> 00:13:07,707
Yes.

315
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:11,216
Bethany Whisperer.

316
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:11,777
What?

317
00:13:12,437 --> 00:13:16,163
Bethany Whisperer did a new Bethany Whisperer lingerie ad.

318
00:13:16,183 --> 00:13:17,105
He saw it in a magazine.

319
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:18,907
You got time to pose for a magazine?

320
00:13:18,927 --> 00:13:19,749
No, the shoot was last year.

321
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:20,450
It just came out.

322
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,413
So because he saw you in a thong.

323
00:13:22,432 --> 00:13:23,594
No, it wasn't a thong.

324
00:13:23,614 --> 00:13:24,836
Now you're hiding out in the hallway.

325
00:13:25,157 --> 00:13:27,360
I just think it might be easier if you sign another interview.

326
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:28,881
Easy is not in your job description.

327
00:13:28,922 --> 00:13:29,923
You are a doctor.

328
00:13:29,984 --> 00:13:30,804
He is a patient.

329
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,027
He's your patient.

330
00:13:32,086 --> 00:13:33,028
Biopsy these.

331
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:36,413
If they come back positive, I expect to see you in surgery.

332
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,481
Hey, you on this, you understand me?

333
00:13:40,522 --> 00:13:51,740
Vertiginous or lightheadedness?

334
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,782
Lightheaded.

335
00:13:52,822 --> 00:13:55,145
Sometimes he'd have to brace himself to get out of bed.

336
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:56,148
Could be a million things.

337
00:13:56,488 --> 00:13:57,450
Simple orthostasis.

338
00:13:58,331 --> 00:13:58,772
What?

339
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,082
What made him fall downstairs with a nail gun?

340
00:14:01,123 --> 00:14:02,024
He said he tripped.

341
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,509
Just because you hear hoofbeats, don't assume zebras.

342
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:07,453
Something caused him to lose consciousness and fall down the stairs.

343
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:08,856
He could have a tumor.

344
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:12,864
Look, I have no idea why this guy is still alive, let alone moving and talking.

345
00:14:13,806 --> 00:14:14,366
Not a clue.

346
00:14:15,227 --> 00:14:17,993
Let's just get him through this before we start digging around for something else.

347
00:14:19,947 --> 00:14:22,129
Shepard.

348
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:22,649
23 cases?

349
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,392
One was attempted suicide.

350
00:14:24,552 --> 00:14:25,232
Yeah, that doesn't count.

351
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:26,033
Talk to me about procedure.

352
00:14:26,214 --> 00:14:30,097
Biggest problems were bleeding and infection, but the odds improved to shorter surgery times.

353
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:32,981
Bottom line was, get them out quickly and watch for bleeding.

354
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:34,363
I got it.

355
00:14:34,383 --> 00:14:35,565
In other words, I'm on my own.

356
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:44,975
You coming?

357
00:14:46,155 --> 00:14:49,200
Dude, I don't need an escort.

358
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:49,379
Go.

359
00:14:50,895 --> 00:14:51,297
Go ahead.

360
00:14:54,546 --> 00:14:56,029
Well, well, well.

361
00:14:58,657 --> 00:15:00,302
Dr. Bethany Whisperer.

362
00:15:00,743 --> 00:15:03,048
That's so nice.

363
00:15:21,304 --> 00:15:23,486
She had this thing, red, when we met.

364
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:28,212
Red car, red dresses, red hats.

365
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:30,495
Personally, I hated the color.

366
00:15:31,657 --> 00:15:33,298
Too obvious, you know?

367
00:15:33,317 --> 00:15:37,964
But a couple of years ago, I took her up to the mountains.

368
00:15:39,725 --> 00:15:40,866
And she was in her red dress.

369
00:15:41,868 --> 00:15:47,193
And there was this field of red poppies, I think.

370
00:15:47,984 --> 00:15:56,735
And she jumped out of the car and ran into them and started laughing, laughing at all of the red.

371
00:15:59,638 --> 00:16:08,408
The good news is it hasn't spread from his prostate to his lymph nodes.

372
00:16:08,428 --> 00:16:11,312
With a radical prostatectomy, we could probably get it all.

373
00:16:12,352 --> 00:16:13,475
Good prognosis.

374
00:16:13,495 --> 00:16:16,118
Spare some nerves, give him a chance at a normal sex life?

375
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:19,443
Young puppies like to take chances with cancer.

376
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:23,067
Old dogs like me, we do what works.

377
00:16:23,087 --> 00:16:24,528
Yes, sir, of course.

378
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:25,590
We on the schedule tomorrow?

379
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:26,571
Uh, 10 AM.

380
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,091
Good.

381
00:16:27,431 --> 00:16:29,113
Maybe I can squeeze in a round.

382
00:16:30,433 --> 00:16:32,296
An ass who deals in asses.

383
00:16:33,697 --> 00:16:34,898
We call him Limp Harry.

384
00:16:35,418 --> 00:16:36,818
He never spares the nerves.

385
00:16:41,683 --> 00:16:46,628
As you can see, the patient has shot seven nails directly into the skull.

386
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:51,759
without doing significant damage other than the optic nerve.

387
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,903
And we may be able to save that.

388
00:16:55,385 --> 00:16:59,393
The idea is to remove the nails at exactly the angle they entered.

389
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:05,241
Any wiggle and we risk doing more damage than when they went in.

390
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:06,884
Where are they?

391
00:17:07,165 --> 00:17:08,647
Move over.

392
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:09,730
They're just pulling them out.

393
00:17:10,537 --> 00:17:12,098
Hey, I heard you got a whipple.

394
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:13,019
Yeah, maybe a whipple.

395
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,442
Burke has rung my butt off.

396
00:17:14,982 --> 00:17:16,483
Oh, man, look at those films.

397
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:19,208
It's Hellraiser.

398
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,613
Shell phone.

399
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:27,038
There you go.

400
00:17:27,117 --> 00:17:31,703
There goes the third grade.

401
00:17:31,723 --> 00:17:35,327
Dr. Yang.

402
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:40,054
Fisher's sailing for their mission.

403
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:42,843
Did you put in the blood work?

404
00:17:43,805 --> 00:17:45,048
Oh, right before I got here.

405
00:17:46,874 --> 00:17:48,397
Take her to radiology for the MRI.

406
00:17:48,478 --> 00:17:49,200
Beat me when you're done.

407
00:17:53,952 --> 00:17:54,815
You want the Whipple, right?

408
00:17:57,863 --> 00:17:58,144
Yeah.

409
00:18:03,388 --> 00:18:05,472
Here.

410
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:06,974
I'm actually out of the grocery money.

411
00:18:07,455 --> 00:18:09,278
When are you going?

412
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:15,490
Okay, seriously, George, please don't... Yeah, can we not talk about it here?

413
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:16,092
What, tampons?

414
00:18:17,453 --> 00:18:18,736
Did you not hear a word I said?

415
00:18:18,776 --> 00:18:22,963
You're a man, we know.

416
00:18:24,707 --> 00:18:27,050
Talk about shrinking the salamander.

417
00:18:34,134 --> 00:18:38,065
I always divided surgeons into two categories.

418
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:42,315
Those that remember the name of their patients and those who didn't.

419
00:18:42,957 --> 00:18:45,462
They all remember their surgeries, of course.

420
00:18:45,903 --> 00:18:47,587
Every damn suture.

421
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:50,320
But the good ones remember their names, right?

422
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,521
I didn't say that.

423
00:18:51,602 --> 00:18:56,446
Now, some of the best ones, you know, distance themselves on purpose.

424
00:18:56,907 --> 00:19:02,153
They believe that the personal stuff clouds the medicine.

425
00:19:02,594 --> 00:19:03,494
Hi, Liz.

426
00:19:03,515 --> 00:19:04,895
Hey, bud.

427
00:19:04,915 --> 00:19:05,957
I'm waiting for the blood.

428
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:09,300
I'm sure this baby can see you.

429
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,060
Hey, Liz.

430
00:19:10,142 --> 00:19:11,082
Hey.

431
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:11,942
You're looking good.

432
00:19:12,064 --> 00:19:13,525
Oh, you liar.

433
00:19:13,505 --> 00:19:14,846
How you doing, honey?

434
00:19:14,865 --> 00:19:16,288
Oh, fabulous.

435
00:19:16,307 --> 00:19:17,608
Just fabulous.

436
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,192
Hey, Liz.

437
00:19:20,211 --> 00:19:20,472
Hey.

438
00:19:20,932 --> 00:19:21,353
Hey, Liz.

439
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:23,455
Bleeding?

440
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:24,856
It's clean.

441
00:19:25,817 --> 00:19:26,018
All right.

442
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:26,739
Way to go, team.

443
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,961
Good job, everybody.

444
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,340
Thank you.

445
00:19:30,143 --> 00:19:31,223
I don't think we made it worse.

446
00:19:32,325 --> 00:19:35,248
The big question is the optic nerve.

447
00:19:35,268 --> 00:19:37,049
We'll know in the morning.

448
00:19:37,069 --> 00:19:38,251
Should I order the MRI?

449
00:19:38,852 --> 00:19:39,853
It needs to stabilize.

450
00:19:40,453 --> 00:19:41,335
We'll do it tomorrow.

451
00:19:44,942 --> 00:19:47,405
Is it over?

452
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:49,548
Hey, is it over?

453
00:19:49,607 --> 00:19:59,759
Yeah, it's over.

454
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:01,561
Hey, does Burke have a Whipple scheduled?

455
00:20:03,364 --> 00:20:08,170
Dr. Burke, I wanted to know if you've seen Nurse Fallon's labs.

456
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:08,390
I have.

457
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:09,711
They're getting worse.

458
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:12,094
The stent doesn't seem to be helping her jaundice.

459
00:20:12,114 --> 00:20:12,634
No.

460
00:20:12,654 --> 00:20:13,536
Should we be doing something?

461
00:20:14,037 --> 00:20:14,477
We are.

462
00:20:14,795 --> 00:20:16,616
Oh, I noticed you didn't have the Whipple on the board.

463
00:20:16,636 --> 00:20:17,699
Do you want me to schedule it for you?

464
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,746
I want to see the results of her biopsy and have a look at her overnight labs.

465
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:24,527
Overnight?

466
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,009
You're on call, right?

467
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,153
Um, sure.

468
00:20:30,193 --> 00:20:30,734
Well, good.

469
00:20:30,755 --> 00:20:31,134
Stick with her.

470
00:20:31,756 --> 00:20:33,097
Well, you're doing the surgery, right?

471
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:35,381
You're still doing the Whipple?

472
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,303
A woman has pancreatic cancer, Dr. Yang.

473
00:20:37,663 --> 00:20:39,145
We're going to do something.

474
00:20:39,165 --> 00:20:42,990
Okay.

475
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:44,311
Kiss the baby for me.

476
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:46,067
Well, get some sleep, Liz.

477
00:20:46,128 --> 00:20:48,790
OK.

478
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:49,612
Bye-bye, Liz.

479
00:20:50,173 --> 00:20:53,016
See you later.

480
00:20:53,036 --> 00:20:54,557
Thanks, Liz.

481
00:20:54,576 --> 00:20:54,737
Bye-bye.

482
00:20:54,757 --> 00:20:55,178
Bye-bye, Liz.

483
00:20:55,278 --> 00:20:55,438
Bye-bye.

484
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:55,837
Take care.

485
00:20:55,857 --> 00:20:56,138
Yeah.

486
00:20:58,381 --> 00:20:59,883
Your mom's a bigger woman.

487
00:21:00,383 --> 00:21:01,344
You were her scrub nurse.

488
00:21:02,005 --> 00:21:03,286
Liz Fallon, come in.

489
00:21:05,468 --> 00:21:06,229
Meredith Gray.

490
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:07,490
Yeah.

491
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:08,912
She wanted me to send her regards.

492
00:21:09,392 --> 00:21:10,313
Doesn't sound like her.

493
00:21:11,094 --> 00:21:11,554
Excuse me?

494
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:14,096
Of Alice Gray, I know.

495
00:21:14,734 --> 00:21:17,699
Didn't have regards for anyone except Ellis Gray.

496
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,301
But you know that already, don't you?

497
00:21:20,903 --> 00:21:21,544
Where is she now?

498
00:21:24,227 --> 00:21:24,688
Traveling.

499
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,250
Traveling?

500
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:27,832
Yeah.

501
00:21:27,852 --> 00:21:27,991
Huh.

502
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:31,395
Is she practicing?

503
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:32,978
Not so much.

504
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,540
Oh.

505
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,143
Doesn't sound like her either.

506
00:21:37,182 --> 00:21:40,166
She was all work, just like me.

507
00:21:40,186 --> 00:21:41,489
She never left the hospital.

508
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,932
But you know that too, don't you?

509
00:21:46,307 --> 00:21:46,848
Is she well?

510
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:48,431
She's fine.

511
00:21:50,313 --> 00:21:50,554
Good.

512
00:21:52,496 --> 00:21:53,617
Just wanted to send her regards.

513
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:54,940
Take care.

514
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:05,614
Yeah.

515
00:22:05,673 --> 00:22:07,817
I think these were taken at the old house.

516
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,741
There's you and your scrubs.

517
00:22:15,518 --> 00:22:16,159
Who is that?

518
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:17,721
That's dad.

519
00:22:19,723 --> 00:22:19,963
Who?

520
00:22:20,785 --> 00:22:24,148
Your husband, Thatcher Gray.

521
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:25,090
You called him Thatch.

522
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:27,433
Thatch.

523
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:31,117
That's the red wagon he got me for my birthday.

524
00:22:31,178 --> 00:22:35,324
I'm about four years old in this photo.

525
00:22:36,665 --> 00:22:37,646
This is your family.

526
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:39,990
Sure.

527
00:22:46,972 --> 00:22:50,097
Saw Liz Fallon at the hospital today.

528
00:22:50,117 --> 00:22:50,198
Liz.

529
00:22:52,721 --> 00:22:53,463
I love her.

530
00:22:53,523 --> 00:22:55,267
How is she?

531
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:58,151
Is she still a scrub nurse?

532
00:22:59,653 --> 00:23:02,198
She was excellent.

533
00:23:10,717 --> 00:23:12,159
I reminded you before you went.

534
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:13,460
I forgot when I got there.

535
00:23:13,641 --> 00:23:14,300
No, no.

536
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,584
You were so passive aggressive.

537
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:17,065
Naked.

538
00:23:17,404 --> 00:23:19,347
I am naked in the shower.

539
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:20,849
Just tampons, George.

540
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,351
I really needed tampons.

541
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:24,894
God.

542
00:23:24,914 --> 00:23:26,155
I'm not riding in the same car with him.

543
00:23:26,496 --> 00:23:28,519
Unless you're going like that, you're not riding with me.

544
00:23:28,578 --> 00:23:29,539
Where are the tampons?

545
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:30,201
He didn't buy them.

546
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,403
You didn't buy them?

547
00:23:32,423 --> 00:23:34,286
Men don't buy tampons.

548
00:23:34,306 --> 00:23:34,646
You know what?

549
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,409
You're going to have to get over the man thing, George.

550
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:37,089
We're women.

551
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:38,651
We have vaginas.

552
00:23:38,892 --> 00:23:39,913
Get used to it.

553
00:23:42,356 --> 00:23:43,699
I am not your sister!

554
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:49,946
Grilled cheese again?

555
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:51,409
Cold pizza.

556
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:53,791
Is he awake?

557
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:54,953
Even better.

558
00:23:54,993 --> 00:23:57,457
Really?

559
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,922
Let's see.

560
00:24:01,162 --> 00:24:02,063
Hey, how are you this morning?

561
00:24:02,864 --> 00:24:05,627
Tell them what color my dress is, Jorge.

562
00:24:05,647 --> 00:24:07,770
I'd know the answer to that even if I couldn't see.

563
00:24:11,415 --> 00:24:12,297
Go ahead and check it out if you like it.

564
00:24:17,221 --> 00:24:18,461
I'm taking the elevator.

565
00:24:18,481 --> 00:24:19,844
You take the stairs.

566
00:24:19,983 --> 00:24:20,904
I was going to anyway.

567
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:21,286
Good.

568
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:22,788
Hold it.

569
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,029
Thank you.

570
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:30,876
What?

571
00:24:40,788 --> 00:24:44,173
You don't wake a patient like that.

572
00:24:44,406 --> 00:24:46,128
What do I have to do to get through to you?

573
00:24:46,829 --> 00:24:47,810
Give me some slack.

574
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,132
I was on call last night.

575
00:24:49,231 --> 00:24:50,294
I didn't get much sleep.

576
00:24:50,534 --> 00:24:51,755
Oh, stop whining.

577
00:24:52,817 --> 00:24:54,778
You'd rather be here and you know it.

578
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,781
What you got waiting for you at home?

579
00:24:58,442 --> 00:24:59,023
Boyfriend?

580
00:25:00,525 --> 00:25:00,744
No.

581
00:25:02,386 --> 00:25:03,248
A girlfriend?

582
00:25:04,148 --> 00:25:04,410
No.

583
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:06,010
A pet?

584
00:25:06,751 --> 00:25:07,393
Family?

585
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,340
A bed.

586
00:25:12,683 --> 00:25:14,287
You got plenty of beds here.

587
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:17,073
I don't feel sorry for you.

588
00:25:17,713 --> 00:25:19,017
This is who we are.

589
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:20,179
This is our lives.

590
00:25:21,942 --> 00:25:23,526
You tell her, Dr. Burke.

591
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,521
Excuse me.

592
00:25:40,761 --> 00:25:43,065
What's going on?

593
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:51,134
George, stop.

594
00:25:54,258 --> 00:25:56,800
We have Bethany Whisperer in our locker room.

595
00:25:57,821 --> 00:25:58,403
Oh, boy.

596
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:02,186
I guess they do airbrush out the tattoo, don't they?

597
00:26:10,451 --> 00:26:11,133
You want to see it?

598
00:26:12,413 --> 00:26:13,435
You really want to see it?

599
00:26:14,817 --> 00:26:15,077
Fine.

600
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,201
Let's look at that tattoo up close and personal, shall we?

601
00:26:18,762 --> 00:26:19,482
And what are these?

602
00:26:19,723 --> 00:26:20,625
Oh, my God.

603
00:26:20,785 --> 00:26:21,546
Breasts.

604
00:26:21,566 --> 00:26:24,450
How does anybody practice medicine hauling these things around?

605
00:26:25,872 --> 00:26:26,932
And what have we got back here?

606
00:26:26,972 --> 00:26:28,714
Let's see if I remember my anatomy.

607
00:26:30,718 --> 00:26:31,999
Glutes, right?

608
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:34,342
Let's study them, shall we?

609
00:26:34,362 --> 00:26:38,146
Gather around and check out the booty that put Izzy Stevens through med school.

610
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:44,257
Have you had enough or should I continue because I have a few more very interesting tattoos?

611
00:26:47,824 --> 00:26:49,105
You want to call me Dr. Model?

612
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:51,490
That's fine.

613
00:26:52,472 --> 00:26:57,742
Just remember that while you're sitting on 200 grand of student loans, I'm out of debt.

614
00:27:02,471 --> 00:27:02,852
I'll take her down.

615
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:13,595
Can you tell me what you had for breakfast on Monday?

616
00:27:14,576 --> 00:27:15,196
Cheese omelet.

617
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:17,599
And on Sunday.

618
00:27:19,122 --> 00:27:19,942
And on Saturday.

619
00:27:21,424 --> 00:27:22,286
And on Friday.

620
00:27:23,867 --> 00:27:27,393
Sona gets up every morning and makes me a cheese omelet.

621
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:29,015
It's the only thing he likes.

622
00:27:29,655 --> 00:27:31,258
It's the only thing you know how to cook.

623
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:37,085
Okay, well, things look good, but I need Jorge to get an MRI this morning to check for residual bleeding.

624
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:38,626
Okay?

625
00:27:49,913 --> 00:27:50,733
This is who I was.

626
00:27:51,214 --> 00:27:52,617
It has nothing to do with who I am now.

627
00:27:53,459 --> 00:27:59,190
I'm a physician, a surgeon, and I am just as qualified as any other intern on this floor.

628
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:03,837
So you're just going to have to get over your chauvinist crap and allow me to do my job.

629
00:28:08,665 --> 00:28:10,048
I'm sure you're a very good doctor.

630
00:28:11,632 --> 00:28:12,933
Then what is your problem?

631
00:28:18,112 --> 00:28:19,753
I fantasized about you.

632
00:28:22,037 --> 00:28:23,979
About the woman in this photo, whoever she is.

633
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:28,925
I'm not proud of it, but it's a fact.

634
00:28:36,095 --> 00:28:37,276
Do you know what they're gonna do to me today?

635
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,622
I have cancer.

636
00:28:43,204 --> 00:28:51,551
and they're gonna lift up my legs and expose me to the world and cut out my prostate and my nerves and effectively neuter me.

637
00:28:55,536 --> 00:29:11,490
So is it so hard to understand that I don't want the woman who's in that photo to witness... my emasculation?

638
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:15,409
Have you seen her overnight labs?

639
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:16,351
I have.

640
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:17,672
Did you check her liver panel?

641
00:29:18,093 --> 00:29:18,693
They're not good.

642
00:29:18,713 --> 00:29:19,615
No, they suck.

643
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:20,776
She's choking on bile.

644
00:29:20,796 --> 00:29:21,497
She's jaundiced.

645
00:29:21,557 --> 00:29:23,319
A very sick woman.

646
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:24,461
Why haven't you scheduled the Whipple?

647
00:29:26,123 --> 00:29:27,023
Are you her surgeon now?

648
00:29:27,384 --> 00:29:30,188
I'm her cruise director pushing her around all day.

649
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,430
The woman is circling the drain.

650
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,391
We need to do something.

651
00:29:34,394 --> 00:29:35,755
I'll take a look at her biopsies.

652
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:36,777
What are the biopsies?

653
00:29:36,797 --> 00:29:38,138
You know, enough.

654
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,299
You know, I...

655
00:29:39,887 --> 00:29:40,390
You know what I think?

656
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,096
I think you never intended to do the Whipple.

657
00:29:42,376 --> 00:29:47,755
I think this entire thing has been bull, and you're behaving like the only reason she's in this hospital is to die.

658
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,811
There.

659
00:30:11,232 --> 00:30:11,792
It's a tumor.

660
00:30:13,194 --> 00:30:14,455
Midline of the hypothalamus.

661
00:30:28,692 --> 00:30:28,791
Damn.

662
00:30:28,811 --> 00:30:29,492
Best practice?

663
00:30:29,993 --> 00:30:31,194
Probably to remove the tumor.

664
00:30:31,615 --> 00:30:33,057
Probably because I can't get it all.

665
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:37,701
99%, but not all of it.

666
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:40,404
Radiation and chemo, you're looking at maybe five to ten good years.

667
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:47,781
You haven't heard the downside.

668
00:30:48,363 --> 00:30:53,292
See, the tumor is located in the part of your brain where your memory and your personality resides.

669
00:30:54,335 --> 00:30:58,682
And because of the fuzzy edges of this type of tumor, I have to cut out a lot.

670
00:30:59,664 --> 00:31:06,038
All right, you stand a good chance of losing your memories, of losing who you are.

671
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,281
Is there any other way?

672
00:31:08,531 --> 00:31:11,636
The alternative is a gamma or cyber knife treatment with focused radiation.

673
00:31:11,717 --> 00:31:18,708
It's less evasive, this little chance of memory loss or him losing himself, but it would only give Jorge maybe three to five years.

674
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,270
Three to five years?

675
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,823
This is an incredibly difficult decision.

676
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:54,955
I told my mother about you.

677
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:57,239
She remembers you very well.

678
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,821
Of course she would.

679
00:31:59,882 --> 00:32:04,867
Ellis Gray never forgot a thing.

680
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:16,221
Oh!

681
00:32:18,277 --> 00:32:19,699
I'm sorry.

682
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:22,423
It's not really funny.

683
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:25,727
It's not funny, but... What's her diagnosis?

684
00:32:29,171 --> 00:32:29,751
Alzheimer's.

685
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:36,621
Early onset.

686
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:38,443
And she doesn't want anyone to know?

687
00:32:39,265 --> 00:32:39,464
No.

688
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:46,173
She's in a nursing home, and I'm the only person she'll allow to see her.

689
00:32:49,089 --> 00:32:54,698
But if I know Ellis Gray, she made the nursing home sign a contract to that effect.

690
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,141
You know my mother well.

691
00:32:59,163 --> 00:32:59,845
What a bitch.

692
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:07,836
The woman's life was this hospital.

693
00:33:08,297 --> 00:33:09,057
It was her home.

694
00:33:09,198 --> 00:33:10,861
It's a sweet thing for them to do.

695
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,384
It's a waste of a bed and it's a waste of my time.

696
00:33:13,805 --> 00:33:15,267
Who are we talking about?

697
00:33:15,532 --> 00:33:16,314
Miss Fallon.

698
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:17,435
They brought her here to die.

699
00:33:18,176 --> 00:33:20,118
Wouldn't you want them to do the same thing for you?

700
00:33:20,138 --> 00:33:20,200
No.

701
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:21,040
You know what?

702
00:33:21,181 --> 00:33:22,863
I'd want the doctors to do everything they could.

703
00:33:22,903 --> 00:33:24,786
I'd want them to cut me open until the minute I die.

704
00:33:25,145 --> 00:33:27,609
Sometimes doing everything can be worse than doing nothing.

705
00:33:31,214 --> 00:33:32,336
You are eight feet tall.

706
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:34,480
Your boobs are perfect.

707
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,001
Your hair is down to there.

708
00:33:36,061 --> 00:33:40,528
If I were you, I would walk around naked all the time.

709
00:33:41,031 --> 00:33:43,214
I wouldn't have a job.

710
00:33:43,234 --> 00:33:44,017
I wouldn't have skills.

711
00:33:44,076 --> 00:33:45,137
I wouldn't even know how to read.

712
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:47,741
I'd just be naked.

713
00:33:49,704 --> 00:33:50,405
It's makeup.

714
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:51,969
It's retouching.

715
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,832
You get that we hate you, right?

716
00:33:57,657 --> 00:33:58,298
Bailey again?

717
00:33:59,941 --> 00:34:00,342
You know what?

718
00:34:00,422 --> 00:34:03,246
Any patient who spanks his doctor's pictures forfeits his rights.

719
00:34:03,586 --> 00:34:05,569
You're seriously not going to give up the prostatectomy, are you?

720
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:07,613
Izzy.

721
00:34:11,373 --> 00:34:14,735
You know, sometimes it's actually, you know, painful to be around you.

722
00:34:14,775 --> 00:34:21,402
Where the hell have you been?

723
00:34:22,023 --> 00:34:23,264
When I page, you answer.

724
00:34:23,304 --> 00:34:24,766
It's not that difficult to understand.

725
00:34:25,126 --> 00:34:26,487
O'Malley answered his page.

726
00:34:26,568 --> 00:34:27,568
He's doing your prep.

727
00:34:29,871 --> 00:34:35,918
Dr. Hammond to OR Room 3.

728
00:34:35,938 --> 00:34:36,438
Dr. Hammond to OR Room 3.

729
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:39,740
If I hear the words Bethany Whisper one more time... I can't.

730
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:39,922
Okay?

731
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:41,362
I just...

732
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:42,329
I can't.

733
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:44,253
He doesn't want me in there.

734
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:46,755
No, what he wants is to not have cancer.

735
00:34:46,936 --> 00:34:48,958
What he wants is to be saved.

736
00:34:49,518 --> 00:34:51,420
You want to stay in the scrub room, that's your choice.

737
00:35:00,811 --> 00:35:01,012
All right.

738
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:01,532
We're hands on.

739
00:35:01,552 --> 00:35:02,172
I want the surgery.

740
00:35:03,295 --> 00:35:04,255
They want you to cut it out?

741
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:06,338
It's their decision.

742
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:25,396
They were never gonna operate.

743
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:26,677
You could've told me.

744
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:30,161
What fun would that have been?

745
00:35:32,543 --> 00:35:35,447
Think of it as a hazing ritual.

746
00:35:38,244 --> 00:35:40,208
Well.

747
00:35:40,228 --> 00:35:41,329
Liz, don't talk.

748
00:35:44,396 --> 00:35:46,780
Don't talk.

749
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:50,987
Liz?

750
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:53,070
Liz, stay.

751
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:56,516
Liz, stay with me.

752
00:35:56,536 --> 00:35:57,418
Stay with me, Liz.

753
00:36:11,927 --> 00:36:33,480
Zona.

754
00:36:36,463 --> 00:36:38,387
Let's go.

755
00:36:38,728 --> 00:36:41,293
Push Effie into actual pain.

756
00:36:41,454 --> 00:36:44,320
Somebody pays work.

757
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,166
Okay, go.

758
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:48,228
She's DNI.

759
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,661
She's DNR.

760
00:36:49,701 --> 00:36:51,443
Do not resuscitate.

761
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:52,023
Dr. Yang.

762
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:52,545
Come on, people.

763
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,545
Push another epi.

764
00:36:53,565 --> 00:36:54,007
Come on.

765
00:36:54,467 --> 00:36:56,188
You need to consider what you'll lose.

766
00:36:56,869 --> 00:37:02,858
What good is five years if he doesn't joke about your omelets and he can't remember seeing you in that red dress?

767
00:37:02,878 --> 00:37:04,280
It's still five more years.

768
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,521
You don't understand.

769
00:37:05,782 --> 00:37:08,125
He'll be there, but he won't be Jorge.

770
00:37:08,405 --> 00:37:09,686
He won't even recognize.

771
00:37:09,726 --> 00:37:10,807
This is our business.

772
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,291
You have no idea what this will do to you.

773
00:37:13,952 --> 00:37:17,014
Isn't five good years better than 10 bad ones?

774
00:37:17,655 --> 00:37:18,797
Meredith, what the hell are you doing?

775
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:20,378
She needs to understand.

776
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:21,519
I do understand.

777
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,543
You think that I'm being selfish, that I don't want to give him up.

778
00:37:26,304 --> 00:37:26,465
I don't.

779
00:37:26,485 --> 00:37:27,885
This is Jorge's decision.

780
00:37:28,867 --> 00:37:30,949
And if that means 10 bad years for me, fine.

781
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,811
I'll give him those years, because I will give him whatever he wants.

782
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,414
Look, I am so sorry, Zona.

783
00:37:35,434 --> 00:37:36,315
Just please forgive her.

784
00:37:36,335 --> 00:37:36,755
She's an intern.

785
00:37:36,775 --> 00:37:40,980
And if he doesn't remember me, if he doesn't remember what we are,

786
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:44,083
He's still my Horty.

787
00:37:44,103 --> 00:37:45,626
And I'll remember for us both.

788
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,271
OK.

789
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,974
All right.

790
00:37:51,994 --> 00:37:53,137
Five, three, one, two.

791
00:37:53,617 --> 00:37:55,139
What the hell are you two doing?

792
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,360
We lost Pulse.

793
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:56,561
One, two.

794
00:37:56,581 --> 00:37:56,922
Let her go.

795
00:37:57,523 --> 00:37:58,264
Where's that Abby?

796
00:37:58,364 --> 00:37:58,784
Let her go.

797
00:37:59,244 --> 00:37:59,905
She's DNR.

798
00:37:59,925 --> 00:38:02,289
Let her go down.

799
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:03,170
Three, four, five, one, two.

800
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,331
Do not resuscitate.

801
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:05,692
All right.

802
00:38:05,711 --> 00:38:06,972
It is on her charge.

803
00:38:07,233 --> 00:38:08,074
Let her go down.

804
00:38:08,876 --> 00:38:25,396
Let her go down.

805
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,302
Where are they?

806
00:38:30,322 --> 00:38:33,545
He's resecting the prostate, coming up on the distal nerve.

807
00:38:35,568 --> 00:38:38,652
You said I am not your sister.

808
00:38:40,954 --> 00:38:42,496
Do you feel like I was emasculating you?

809
00:38:42,516 --> 00:38:42,715
No.

810
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:44,057
No.

811
00:38:44,898 --> 00:38:51,766
I'm too masculine to be emasculated.

812
00:38:53,527 --> 00:38:54,009
I'm sorry.

813
00:38:57,253 --> 00:38:58,914
Guess you put Dr. Model to rest.

814
00:39:00,376 --> 00:39:01,137
Guess I did.

815
00:39:02,568 --> 00:39:05,650
Dr. Victor, I'm sorry, but these are viable nerves.

816
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,012
We should save them.

817
00:39:07,032 --> 00:39:10,934
It'll take at least an hour longer, and we might not get it all.

818
00:39:11,695 --> 00:39:13,297
I know they call him Limp Harry.

819
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:24,186
But his prognosis with chemo is nearly as good, and frankly, if you're worried about missing your tea time, I'd be more than happy to finish.

820
00:39:24,226 --> 00:39:24,688
Dr. Stevens?

821
00:39:25,668 --> 00:39:26,329
Can we help you?

822
00:39:26,789 --> 00:39:27,789
I'm sorry, Dr. Bailey.

823
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:29,411
Dr. Victor, I agree with her.

824
00:39:30,172 --> 00:39:30,853
You just can't...

825
00:39:31,862 --> 00:39:34,126
You have to save the nerves.

826
00:39:34,967 --> 00:39:35,148
What?

827
00:39:35,188 --> 00:39:35,608
The nerves.

828
00:39:35,628 --> 00:39:36,509
You have to save them.

829
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,590
Dr. Stevens, I can handle this.

830
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:40,014
No, you told me the most important thing is giving the patient what they want.

831
00:39:40,034 --> 00:39:41,597
What Humphrey wants is his erection.

832
00:39:42,657 --> 00:39:43,318
She's yours.

833
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,641
You get her out.

834
00:39:45,101 --> 00:39:46,003
Can't do that, sir.

835
00:39:46,483 --> 00:39:48,266
You know how these young puppies are.

836
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:52,170
I'm going to tell Richard about both of you.

837
00:39:52,311 --> 00:39:52,791
You do that.

838
00:39:53,032 --> 00:39:56,217
In the meantime, let's pretend it's you on this table and give this a try.

839
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:20,637
Look me in the eye and tell me you don't find me attractive.

840
00:40:20,657 --> 00:40:23,922
Look me in the heart and tell me you won't go.

841
00:40:25,503 --> 00:40:29,648
Look me in the eye and promise no loves like I love.

842
00:40:30,108 --> 00:40:32,650
Look me in the heart and I'm very broken.

843
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,391
You ever called one?

844
00:40:42,704 --> 00:40:59,827
Time of death, 1143.

845
00:41:00,228 --> 00:41:02,492
I wish there were a rule book for intimacy.

846
00:41:03,012 --> 00:41:10,804
Some kind of a guide that could tell you when you've crossed the line.

847
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:23,320
It would be nice if you could see it coming.

848
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,085
I'll get it.

849
00:41:27,105 --> 00:41:28,487
Better go.

850
00:41:28,507 --> 00:41:30,429
But I don't know how you'd fit in on a map.

851
00:41:43,554 --> 00:41:44,436
Of course.

852
00:41:44,456 --> 00:41:48,380
Now, you know every time he gets a rise, he'll be thinking of you.

853
00:41:49,902 --> 00:41:51,364
You take it where you can get it.

854
00:41:55,228 --> 00:41:58,472
And keep it as long as you can.

855
00:41:58,492 --> 00:42:10,947
And as for rules...

856
00:42:13,811 --> 00:42:15,193
Better not be using my toothbrush.

857
00:42:16,476 --> 00:42:18,318
I'm not.

858
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:28,195
Maybe there are none.

859
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:33,643
Maybe the rules of intimacy are something you have to define for yourself.

860
00:42:48,034 --> 00:42:49,135
Good night.
