1
00:00:01,943 --> 00:00:04,776
Intimacy is a four-syllable word for

2
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:06,715
"here are my heart and soul.

3
00:00:07,088 --> 00:00:08,757
Please grind them into hamburger

4
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,228
and enjoy."

5
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:13,906
It's both desired and feared,

6
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:16,470
difficult to live with...

7
00:00:16,634 --> 00:00:17,654
Uh, excuse me!

8
00:00:18,043 --> 00:00:18,984
Excuse me!

9
00:00:19,317 --> 00:00:21,407
...and impossible to live without.

10
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:26,619
Is that my toothbrush?!

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,287
Intimacy also comes attached to life's three R's --

12
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:48,245
relatives, romance, and roommates.

13
00:00:50,376 --> 00:00:53,736
- Coffee?
- There are some things you can't escape.

14
00:00:54,923 --> 00:00:58,168
And other things you just don't want to know.

15
00:00:58,394 --> 00:00:59,336
Hello, Kitty.

16
00:01:04,877 --> 00:01:07,374
You don't understand. Me gonads, you ovaries.

17
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:09,207
Oh, that reminds me.

18
00:01:09,345 --> 00:01:10,430
We are out of tampons.

19
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:14,005
You're parading through the bathroom in your underwear when I'm naked in the shower.

20
00:01:14,092 --> 00:01:15,331
Can you add it to your list, please?

21
00:01:15,392 --> 00:01:16,733
- What?!
- Tampons!

22
00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:18,689
It's to the list. It's your turn.

23
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:20,686
I am a man!

24
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:22,841
I don't buy girl products!

25
00:01:22,964 --> 00:01:25,365
I don't want you walking in while I'm in the shower,

26
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,142
and I don't want to see you in your underwear.

27
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:28,602
It doesn't bother me, okay?

28
00:01:28,669 --> 00:01:30,184
Look at me in my underwear, George.

29
00:01:30,251 --> 00:01:32,038
Take your time. It's no big deal.

30
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:37,700
You are the first person they see in the morning.

31
00:01:37,793 --> 00:01:39,753
You say please. You say thank you.

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,143
You apologize for waking them up.

33
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:44,546
You make them feel good about you.

34
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:45,926
Why is that important?

35
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:48,897
'Cause then they'll talk to you and tell you what's wrong.

36
00:01:48,974 --> 00:01:50,451
Why is that important?

37
00:01:50,515 --> 00:01:54,074
Because then you can tell your attending what they need to know during rounds.

38
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:56,179
And why is that important?

39
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,306
Because if you make your resident look bad,

40
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:02,399
she'll torture you until you beg for your mama.

41
00:02:02,978 --> 00:02:06,793
Now get out there. I want pre-rounds done by 5:30 A.M.

42
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,634
Morning, Dr. Model.

43
00:02:09,178 --> 00:02:10,264
Dr. Evil Spawn.

44
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,727
Ooh, nice tat.

45
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,755
They airbrush that out for the catalogs?

46
00:02:14,861 --> 00:02:15,670
I don't know.

47
00:02:16,004 --> 00:02:18,211
What do they do for the 6-6-6 on your skull?

48
00:02:18,792 --> 00:02:20,704
I'd better get good patients today.

49
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:25,000
Yesterday I had two guys with colostomies who needed dressing changes every 15 minutes.

50
00:02:25,056 --> 00:02:26,162
I'm gonna be in surgery.

51
00:02:26,377 --> 00:02:27,334
Today's my day.

52
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:28,210
On what?

53
00:02:28,332 --> 00:02:29,264
Like I'd tell you.

54
00:02:29,536 --> 00:02:30,426
What do you know?

55
00:02:30,657 --> 00:02:33,160
I know that I was here at 4:00, and you didn't get here till 4:30.

56
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:34,138
Tell me.

57
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:35,551
No.

58
00:02:36,854 --> 00:02:39,592
I'm not the intern who's screwing an attending.

59
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:42,916
I am not screw--

60
00:02:44,317 --> 00:02:45,198
You're here early.

61
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,969
I have chordotomy at 5:00. I'll be out at 6:00.

62
00:02:47,027 --> 00:02:48,983
I thought I might buy you breakfast before your rounds.

63
00:02:49,058 --> 00:02:49,970
I've already eaten.

64
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:50,770
What did you have?

65
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:51,814
None of your business.

66
00:02:51,957 --> 00:02:52,904
You a cereal person?

67
00:02:53,134 --> 00:02:55,044
Straight out of the box? Or are you all fruit and fibery?

68
00:02:55,812 --> 00:02:57,348
Pancakes? Do you like pancakes.

69
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,207
Fine, leftover grilled cheese.

70
00:02:59,309 --> 00:03:02,070
- Curiosity satisfied?
- That's sad. It's pathetic.

71
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:04,050
A good day starts with a good breakfast.

72
00:03:04,188 --> 00:03:06,585
Look, I'm not being seen with you in this hospital.

73
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:08,664
Learn it, live it. It's unprofessional.

74
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:10,788
Think of it as an attending getting to know one of his interns.

75
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:12,565
- He slept with the intern.
- Barely knew her.

76
00:03:12,698 --> 00:03:15,009
- And its just stay that way.
- You want me to be professional?

77
00:03:15,243 --> 00:03:17,066
- I'll be professional.
- That's what I want.

78
00:03:17,148 --> 00:03:18,029
Then that's what you get.

79
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,697
You're gonna be late for your chordotomy.

80
00:03:21,392 --> 00:03:23,133
Nice talking to you, Dr. Grey.

81
00:03:26,246 --> 00:03:29,123
Anyone seen the floor chart on the new admission?

82
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,752
You always come in like that, bang the light on?

83
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:37,888
You're Elizabeth Fallon?

84
00:03:38,277 --> 00:03:39,999
What does my chart say?

85
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:42,271
It says you used to be a nurse here.

86
00:03:42,503 --> 00:03:44,150
A scrub nurse.

87
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:47,126
And that you have abdominal mass consistent with pancreatic cancer.

88
00:03:47,243 --> 00:03:51,498
Oh, and you are hoping they're gonna give me a whipple...

89
00:03:52,464 --> 00:03:55,297
pancreatic duodectomy.

90
00:03:55,707 --> 00:04:01,959
This hospital sees those one maybe once every six months.

91
00:04:02,705 --> 00:04:04,862
That's why you got here at 4:30, huh?

92
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:05,756
4:00.

93
00:04:06,403 --> 00:04:09,178
Grab my chart before anybody else could see it.

94
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:13,100
Impress Dr. Burke with your pre-round exam

95
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,277
so you'd be the logical intern for him to ask to scrub in.

96
00:04:17,795 --> 00:04:20,595
I know all the tricks, doctor.

97
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:23,017
Yang -- Cristina Yang.

98
00:04:23,877 --> 00:04:25,993
I'll call you Cristina.

99
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:28,638
You call me nurse Fallon.

100
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:30,246
Mr. Humphrey?

101
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:34,276
Mr. Humphrey, I'm sorry to wake you.

102
00:04:35,895 --> 00:04:36,928
Come on.

103
00:04:38,347 --> 00:04:39,525
What  time is it?

104
00:04:39,831 --> 00:04:40,884
10 after 5:00.

105
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:42,920
I'm  sorry. I just need to do a brief exam.

106
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,280
If you could sit up for one moment.

107
00:04:50,798 --> 00:04:51,520
T hanks.

108
00:04:52,196 --> 00:04:55,852
This might be a little bit cold, so just take a deep breath.

109
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,286
If you could just take a deep breath.

110
00:04:57,394 --> 00:04:58,503
You're not a doctor.

111
00:04:58,627 --> 00:05:00,288
I'm Dr. Stevens, but you can call me Izzie.

112
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:02,114
I'll be helping Dr. Bailey with your biopsy this morning.

113
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:03,486
No, I don't think so, no.

114
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:05,482
Mr. Humphrey, this will just take a moment.

115
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:08,145
No, get me Dr. Bailey or Dr. Victor.

116
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:10,762
- I just need to do a brief -- 
- You don't need to do anything.

117
00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:12,411
Is this you?

118
00:05:13,993 --> 00:05:14,683
Huh?

119
00:05:15,195 --> 00:05:16,142
Is this you?

120
00:05:18,006 --> 00:05:19,117
It is, isn't it?

121
00:05:19,696 --> 00:05:20,720
You know, get out of my room.

122
00:05:20,817 --> 00:05:22,205
- Mr. Humphrey -- 
- Get out of my room.

123
00:05:28,609 --> 00:05:30,196
There need to be some rules.

124
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:34,309
So, what, we can walk around in our underwear on alternate tuesdays

125
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:37,124
or you could see bras but not panties?

126
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:39,265
Or are you talking amish rules?

127
00:05:39,332 --> 00:05:41,686
Because if you think you're gonna get Izzie to cover herself --

128
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:43,992
The amount of flesh exposed is not the point.

129
00:05:44,565 --> 00:05:46,510
You have to do something. It's your house.

130
00:05:46,592 --> 00:05:48,507
- It's my mother's house.
- Meredith...

131
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:53,401
Do you like Izzie? Is that what this is about? Do you have a crush on Izzie?

132
00:05:53,508 --> 00:05:55,864
No. Izzie? No. I don't like Izzie.

133
00:05:56,028 --> 00:05:58,941
Izzie -- no. I -- she's not the one I'm attracted to.

134
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,544
Not the one. So there's a one.

135
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:01,352
This is not --

136
00:06:02,224 --> 00:06:04,328
Look, there just have to be some rules.

137
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:07,277
O'Malley, Grey, get Karev and head down to trauma.

138
00:06:07,354 --> 00:06:08,332
Shepherd needs you.

139
00:06:08,444 --> 00:06:09,418
Shepherd's in surgery.

140
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:11,188
He got pulled before he could start.

141
00:06:22,044 --> 00:06:23,015
Those look like --

142
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:24,803
Nails.

143
00:06:58,723 --> 00:06:59,876
I can't see my hands.

144
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,077
Oh, my god. He's conscious.

145
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:03,765
Breathe deeply, George. You won't pass out.

146
00:07:03,826 --> 00:07:06,036
Use 4 milligrams of morphine. Titrate up to 10.

147
00:07:06,438 --> 00:07:08,215
You know what? I don't want him to move.

148
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:09,404
- I can't see.
- It's okay.

149
00:07:09,465 --> 00:07:11,134
We need you to be very still, Mr...

150
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,002
Cruz -- Jorge Cruz.

151
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,518
He tripped and fell down a flight of stairs holding a nail gun.

152
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:18,118
Somehow he managed to miss a blood vessel.

153
00:07:18,179 --> 00:07:21,154
Optic nerve's been affected. Can you feel this?

154
00:07:21,294 --> 00:07:22,844
Numbness on his right side.

155
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:24,043
What's our immediate concern?

156
00:07:24,114 --> 00:07:24,902
Infection.

157
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:28,568
Right. I'm gonna be pulling these nails out in the next half-hour. I need a C.T.

158
00:07:28,635 --> 00:07:29,684
C.T.s are down.

159
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:31,537
- What?
- They exchanged them out last night.

160
00:07:31,603 --> 00:07:33,391
Computer's crashed -- have them back back up by 1:00.

161
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:34,585
Typical. What are the options?

162
00:07:34,656 --> 00:07:35,965
- An M.R.I.
- No brilliant.

163
00:07:36,054 --> 00:07:38,665
The man's got nails in his head. Let's put him in a giant magnet.

164
00:07:38,752 --> 00:07:41,188
You want films from three axis points and a c-arm in surgery.

165
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:44,164
Excellent. Dig up research and find out if this has ever happened before.

166
00:07:44,707 --> 00:07:45,307
My wife.

167
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:46,565
My wife, my wife.

168
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,531
You wife is on the way, Mr. Cruz.

169
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:51,582
Stay with him, keep him calm, and look for changes.

170
00:07:53,852 --> 00:07:55,023
I can't see.

171
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:58,100
55-year-old woman with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

172
00:07:58,182 --> 00:08:00,891
Has had radiation therapy to reduce the tumor load.

173
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:02,954
Rates her abdominal pain 3 out of 10.

174
00:08:03,036 --> 00:08:04,849
Positive nausea, but no vomiting.

175
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,917
Diarrhea, hematochezia, melena,

176
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:11,586
afebrile with t-max 37-2 and stable vital signs.

177
00:08:11,673 --> 00:08:13,803
Lab significant for a total ability of 7

178
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:15,432
and elevated liver enzymes.

179
00:08:15,524 --> 00:08:17,705
Thank you, Dr. Yang.

180
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:20,003
Aggressive little witch, isn't she?

181
00:08:20,096 --> 00:08:22,861
She stole my chart during pre-rounds

182
00:08:22,947 --> 00:08:24,847
so she could scrub in on my surgery.

183
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:26,193
She's hoping for a whipple.

184
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:29,344
Well, actually, Liz, I was gonna give you to Meredith Grey.

185
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,709
Ellis' daughter?

186
00:08:31,816 --> 00:08:33,633
Yes, she's an intern this year.

187
00:08:33,773 --> 00:08:35,610
Thought you'd have something to talk about.

188
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:37,263
Oh, I doubt that.

189
00:08:37,811 --> 00:08:40,991
I was Ellis' scrub nurse for 18 years,

190
00:08:41,057 --> 00:08:44,175
practically lived with that woman. I didn't meet that daughter once.

191
00:08:46,347 --> 00:08:49,911
Well, anyway, Shepherd has her on the guy with the nails in his head.

192
00:08:49,998 --> 00:08:51,477
There's a guy with nails in his head?

193
00:08:51,712 --> 00:08:52,701
Seven of them.

194
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:54,508
Shot himself in the head with a nail gun.

195
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,865
Nail nails?

196
00:08:56,561 --> 00:08:58,567
16 pennies, 3 1/2 inches long.

197
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,032
And he's still alive?

198
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:01,174
Fully conscious.

199
00:09:01,272 --> 00:09:02,946
Should be a pretty interesting surgery.

200
00:09:03,058 --> 00:09:05,270
But I guess you've got the whipple.

201
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,967
I'm gonna need a full blood work-up and abdominal C.T.

202
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:13,483
C.T.s are down this morning.

203
00:09:13,663 --> 00:09:16,156
Then an M.R.I. She needs an enema,

204
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:20,047
an ERCP for a stent, and brush biopsy this afternoon.

205
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:21,295
Take care of her.

206
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,483
Liz is an institution around here.

207
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:27,153
Good call, doctor.

208
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:29,821
Grey's got the human 2x4,

209
00:09:29,996 --> 00:09:33,394
and you have the institution in need of an enema.

210
00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:38,823
You'd say your health's been good recently?

211
00:09:39,376 --> 00:09:40,844
Maybe some headaches.

212
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:43,196
Nothing compared to now.

213
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:46,185
Sona -- that's my wife.

214
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:47,492
Sona -- she'll say,

215
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:50,444
"why you think they call it a gun, moron?"

216
00:09:51,096 --> 00:09:52,764
She hates the damn things.

217
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,270
With good reason.

218
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:58,878
Baby?

219
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,932
Sona.

220
00:10:03,022 --> 00:10:05,485
You are in so much trouble.

221
00:10:09,764 --> 00:10:11,721
Get a history from her before you scrub in.

222
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:12,487
Okay.

223
00:10:12,555 --> 00:10:13,397
Thank you.

224
00:10:16,562 --> 00:10:17,617
23.

225
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:21,857
People have been accidently shot in the head with nails 23 times.

226
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,484
One was attempted suicide -- doesn't count.

227
00:10:24,596 --> 00:10:27,617
Oh, so he pointed a nail gun at his head on purpose?

228
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:28,902
That makes me feel better.

229
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:30,381
So, uh...

230
00:10:30,991 --> 00:10:33,571
Grey and Stevens really walk around in their underwear?

231
00:10:36,765 --> 00:10:39,644
Not all the time. I mean, some of the time, you know.

232
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:42,091
But not all the time.

233
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:43,402
Sexy underwear?

234
00:10:45,455 --> 00:10:47,150
Yeah.  I mean...

235
00:10:48,118 --> 00:10:50,508
And they just, uh, let you look at them?

236
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:54,016
Well, uh...

237
00:10:54,907 --> 00:10:55,690
yeah.

238
00:10:56,064 --> 00:10:57,017
Like sisters.

239
00:10:57,247 --> 00:10:59,730
No, well, not like sisters.

240
00:11:00,522 --> 00:11:02,766
I don't think of them as sisters.

241
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:04,645
But they're not coming on to you.

242
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,585
Not exactly.

243
00:11:06,704 --> 00:11:08,573
They don't expect you to do anything.

244
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:09,842
No...

245
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:12,162
But...

246
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:13,272
Like sisters.

247
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,206
Just like sisters.

248
00:11:25,105 --> 00:11:26,374
Is he prepped?

249
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,374
I think they're doing it right now.

250
00:11:30,465 --> 00:11:31,372
You think?

251
00:11:31,576 --> 00:11:33,743
He's having a prostate biopsy.

252
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,160
Trust me. If you'd been in there, you'd know.

253
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:42,302
Okay, Mr. Humphrey. We're gonna get started.

254
00:11:47,935 --> 00:11:49,594
Get her out of here.

255
00:11:49,732 --> 00:11:51,791
I want her out of here! Just get her out of here!

256
00:11:51,997 --> 00:11:54,998
Go! Now! Just you go! Now!

257
00:11:56,001 --> 00:11:59,506
Hey, relax! Relax, Mr. Humphrey.

258
00:12:01,748 --> 00:12:03,474
Will he be able to see again?

259
00:12:03,858 --> 00:12:06,280
We won't know until the nails come out.

260
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:08,529
Did he tell you he takes photos?

261
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,750
Beautiful photos.

262
00:12:10,847 --> 00:12:11,733
It's his hobby.

263
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:16,271
I just got him a new digital camera, and now he can't stop, you know?

264
00:12:16,377 --> 00:12:19,614
He always has it out -- always taking pictures of me.

265
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,030
Jorge said he's been having headaches.

266
00:12:22,112 --> 00:12:24,472
Can you tell me about them? Have they been recent?

267
00:12:27,002 --> 00:12:29,934
I'm not sure. Maybe the last couple of months.

268
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,267
Have you seen him experience any dizziness or disorientation?

269
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:40,231
Yes, yes, I have.

270
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,975
Okay.

271
00:12:47,993 --> 00:12:50,155
You want to tell me what that was all about?

272
00:12:51,445 --> 00:12:52,211
Nothing.

273
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:53,917
He's probably just crazy or something.

274
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,290
- Bethany Whisper.
- What?

275
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:05,713
Bethany Whisper.

276
00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:09,396
I did a new Bethany Whisper lingerie ad. He saw it in a magazine.

277
00:13:09,472 --> 00:13:11,843
- You got time to pose for magazines?
- No, the shoot was last year.

278
00:13:11,905 --> 00:13:12,826
It just came out.

279
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:15,554
- So because he saw you in a thong... 
- No, it wasn't a thong.

280
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:17,264
...you're hiding out in the hallway.

281
00:13:17,341 --> 00:13:19,389
It might be easier if you assign another intern.

282
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:21,001
Easy is not in your job description.

283
00:13:21,075 --> 00:13:23,010
You are a doctor. He is a patient.

284
00:13:23,112 --> 00:13:25,539
He's your patient. Biopsy these.

285
00:13:25,703 --> 00:13:28,621
If they come back positive, I expect to see you in surgery.

286
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:32,912
Hey, you're on this. You understand me?

287
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:44,145
Vertiginous or light-headedness?

288
00:13:44,243 --> 00:13:47,300
Light-headed. Sometimes he'd have to brace himself to get out of bed.

289
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:49,679
Could be a million things -- simple orthostasis.

290
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,011
What?

291
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:53,182
What made him fall downstairs with a nail gun?

292
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:54,319
He said he tripped.

293
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:56,618
Just because you hear hoofbeats, don't assume zebras.

294
00:13:56,694 --> 00:13:59,813
Something caused him to lose consciousness and fall down the stairs.

295
00:13:59,966 --> 00:14:01,206
He  could have a tumor.

296
00:14:01,451 --> 00:14:05,255
Look, I have no idea why this guy's still alive let alone moving and talking.

297
00:14:05,668 --> 00:14:06,683
Not a clue.

298
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,068
Let's just get him through this before we start digging around for something else.

299
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:12,848
Shepherd.

300
00:14:13,908 --> 00:14:15,024
23 cases?

301
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:16,555
One was attempted suicide.

302
00:14:16,632 --> 00:14:18,245
That doesn't count. Talk to me about procedure.

303
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:20,133
Biggest problems were bleeding and infection.

304
00:14:20,205 --> 00:14:22,320
But the odds improved the shorter surgery times.

305
00:14:22,401 --> 00:14:25,489
Bottom line was get them out quickly and watch for bleeding.

306
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,799
I got it. Other words, I'm on my own.

307
00:14:36,564 --> 00:14:37,497
You coming?

308
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,098
Dude, I don't need an escort.

309
00:14:41,182 --> 00:14:41,864
Go.

310
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:43,739
Go ahead.

311
00:14:46,774 --> 00:14:48,376
Well, well, well.

312
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,740
Dr. Bethany Whisper.

313
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:54,121
That's so nice.

314
00:15:08,864 --> 00:15:11,432
She had this thing for red when we met.

315
00:15:12,456 --> 00:15:16,080
Red car, red dresses, red hats.

316
00:15:16,322 --> 00:15:18,273
Personally, I hated the color.

317
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:20,274
Too obvious, you know?

318
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:23,536
But a couple years ago,

319
00:15:24,202 --> 00:15:25,757
I took her up to the mountains.

320
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:28,615
She was in a red dress,

321
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:32,200
and there was this field of red...

322
00:15:33,203 --> 00:15:34,493
poppies, I think.

323
00:15:35,414 --> 00:15:37,734
And she jumped out of the car

324
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:39,429
and ran into them

325
00:15:40,228 --> 00:15:41,738
and started laughing --

326
00:15:42,877 --> 00:15:44,744
laughing at all the red.

327
00:15:50,975 --> 00:15:55,541
The good news is it hasn't spread from his prostate to his lymph nodes.

328
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:59,228
With a radical prostatectomy, we could probably get it all.

329
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:00,821
Good prognosis.

330
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:03,887
Spare some nerves? Give him a chance at a normal sex life?

331
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:07,430
Young puppies like to take chances with cancer.

332
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:10,580
Old dogs like me, we do what works.

333
00:16:10,651 --> 00:16:12,003
Yes, sir, of course.

334
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,160
We on the schedule tomorrow?

335
00:16:13,268 --> 00:16:14,296
10:00 A.M.

336
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,984
Good. Maybe I can squeeze in a round.

337
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:20,164
An ass who deals in asses.

338
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:22,640
We call him Limp Harry.

339
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:24,728
He never spares the nerves.

340
00:16:29,006 --> 00:16:34,429
As you can see, the patient has shot seven nails directly into the skull

341
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:39,390
without doing significant damage other than the optic nerve,

342
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:41,719
and we may be able to save that.

343
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:47,183
The idea is to remove the nails at exactly the angle they entered.

344
00:16:47,746 --> 00:16:53,240
Any wiggle, and we risk doing more damage than when they went in.

345
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:54,628
Where are they?

346
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:55,442
Move over.

347
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,392
They're just pulling them out.

348
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:59,580
Hey, I heard you got a whipple.

349
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:02,138
A maybe whipple. Burke is running my butt off.

350
00:17:02,236 --> 00:17:04,121
Oh, man. Look at those films!

351
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:06,824
It's hell-raiser.

352
00:17:18,835 --> 00:17:20,739
- Gel foam.
- Here you go.

353
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:24,508
There goes the third grade.

354
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:26,234
Dr. Yang...

355
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,565
Did you put in the blood work?

356
00:17:31,163 --> 00:17:32,952
Oh, right before I got here.

357
00:17:33,158 --> 00:17:37,119
Hmm. Take her to radiology for the M.R.I. Beep me when you're done.

358
00:17:41,334 --> 00:17:42,571
You want the whipple, right?

359
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:45,837
Yeah.

360
00:17:50,856 --> 00:17:51,541
- Hey.
- Hey.

361
00:17:52,632 --> 00:17:54,710
Here. My share of the grocery money.

362
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:56,984
- When are you going?
- Tonight.

363
00:17:57,097 --> 00:17:59,867
- Okay, seriously, George. Please don't -- 
- Yeah, could we not talk about it here?

364
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,536
What -- tampons?

365
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:06,688
Did you not hear a word I said?

366
00:18:07,813 --> 00:18:09,206
You're  a man. We know.

367
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:14,873
Talk about shrinking the salamander.

368
00:18:21,276 --> 00:18:25,835
I always divided surgeons into two categories --

369
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:30,317
those that remember the names of their patients and those who didn't.

370
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:33,051
They all remember their surgeries, of course.

371
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:35,082
Every damn suture.

372
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:37,709
But the good ones remember the names, right?

373
00:18:37,796 --> 00:18:39,066
I didn't say that.

374
00:18:39,144 --> 00:18:44,203
Now, some of the best ones, you know, distance themselves on purpose.

375
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:49,859
They believe that the personal stuff clouds the medicine.

376
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:51,098
- Hi, Liz.
- Hey.

377
00:18:51,238 --> 00:18:52,091
But?

378
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:55,543
I'm waiting for the but. I'm sure there's a big, fat qualifier coming.

379
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:58,328
- Hey, Liz.
- Hey!

380
00:18:58,454 --> 00:19:00,411
- Looking good.
- Oh, you liar.

381
00:19:01,154 --> 00:19:03,786
- How you doing, honey?
- Oh, fabulous.

382
00:19:03,944 --> 00:19:05,276
Just fabulous.

383
00:19:06,141 --> 00:19:07,949
- Hey, Liz.
- Hey.

384
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,342
Hey, Liz.

385
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:11,219
Bleeding?

386
00:19:11,757 --> 00:19:12,531
It's clean.

387
00:19:12,805 --> 00:19:14,390
All right. Way to go, team.

388
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,029
Good job, everybody. Thank you.

389
00:19:17,517 --> 00:19:19,018
I don't think we made it worse.

390
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:22,039
The big question is the optic nerve.

391
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:23,852
We'll know in the morning.

392
00:19:24,404 --> 00:19:25,869
Should I order the M.R.I.?

393
00:19:26,258 --> 00:19:27,548
He needs to stabilize.

394
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,787
We'll do it tomorrow.

395
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:35,047
Is it over?

396
00:19:35,128 --> 00:19:37,854
- Hey, is it over?
- Yeah, it's over.

397
00:19:47,122 --> 00:19:49,379
Hey, does Burke have a whipple scheduled?

398
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,431
Dr. Burke, I wanted to know if you've seen nurse Fallon's labs.

399
00:19:55,509 --> 00:19:56,256
I have.

400
00:19:56,342 --> 00:19:57,351
They're getting worse.

401
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,205
The stent doesn't seem to be helping her jaundice.

402
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,003
No.

403
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,135
Should we be doing something?

404
00:20:01,212 --> 00:20:01,909
We are.

405
00:20:02,154 --> 00:20:05,538
Oh, I noticed you didn't have the whipple on the board. Do you want me to schedule it for you?

406
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:11,416
I want to see the results of her biopsy and have a look at her overnight labs.

407
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:12,291
Overnight?

408
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:13,751
You're on call, right?

409
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:17,361
Um... sure, yeah.

410
00:20:17,504 --> 00:20:18,703
Well, good. Stick with her.

411
00:20:19,214 --> 00:20:21,897
You're doing the surgery, right? You're still doing the whipple?

412
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:25,067
The woman has pancreatic cancer, Dr. Yang.

413
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:26,111
We're gonna do something.

414
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:27,022
Okay.

415
00:20:28,706 --> 00:20:29,327
Okay.

416
00:20:30,411 --> 00:20:31,984
Kiss the baby for me.

417
00:20:32,183 --> 00:20:34,048
- Well, get some sleep, Liz.
- Okay.

418
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:36,387
- Good night.
- See you later, hon.

419
00:20:37,284 --> 00:20:38,295
Bye-bye, Liz.

420
00:20:38,962 --> 00:20:40,411
Bye-bye. Take care.

421
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,755
You were her scrub nurse.

422
00:20:47,077 --> 00:20:48,705
Liz Fallon. Come in.

423
00:20:50,426 --> 00:20:51,578
Meredith Grey.

424
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,431
She wanted me to send her regards.

425
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:55,776
That doesn't sound like her.

426
00:20:56,115 --> 00:20:57,051
Excuse me?

427
00:20:57,338 --> 00:20:59,351
Well, the Ellis Grey I know

428
00:20:59,781 --> 00:21:03,395
didn't have regards for anyone except Ellis Grey.

429
00:21:03,578 --> 00:21:05,883
But you know that already, don't you?

430
00:21:06,027 --> 00:21:07,077
Where is she now?

431
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,076
Traveling.

432
00:21:10,383 --> 00:21:11,992
- Traveling?
- Yeah.

433
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:16,860
Is she practicing?

434
00:21:17,346 --> 00:21:18,530
Not so much.

435
00:21:18,985 --> 00:21:25,359
Oh. Doesn't sound like her, either. She was all work, just like me.

436
00:21:25,426 --> 00:21:26,738
She never left the hospital.

437
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,349
But you know that, too, don't you?

438
00:21:31,463 --> 00:21:32,338
Is she well?

439
00:21:32,952 --> 00:21:33,741
She's fine.

440
00:21:35,325 --> 00:21:36,087
Good.

441
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,071
Just wanted to send her regards.

442
00:21:39,593 --> 00:21:40,786
- Take care.
- Yeah.

443
00:21:50,808 --> 00:21:53,270
I think these were taken at the old house.

444
00:21:55,017 --> 00:21:57,075
There's you in your scrubs.

445
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:01,569
Who is that?

446
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,059
That's dad.

447
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,413
Who?

448
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:06,877
Your husband.

449
00:22:07,036 --> 00:22:08,143
Thatcher Grey.

450
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:10,642
You called him Thatch.

451
00:22:11,904 --> 00:22:12,695
Thatch.

452
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:16,498
That's the red wagon he got me for my birthday.

453
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:20,743
I'm about 4 years old in this photo.

454
00:22:21,728 --> 00:22:23,129
This is your family.

455
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,252
Sure, sure.

456
00:22:33,327 --> 00:22:35,622
I saw Liz Fallon at the hospital today.

457
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:37,113
Liz.

458
00:22:37,711 --> 00:22:38,893
I love her.

459
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:40,828
How is she?

460
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,861
Is she still a scrub nurse?

461
00:22:44,617 --> 00:22:45,817
She was excellent.

462
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:51,485
I reminded you before you went.

463
00:22:51,561 --> 00:22:52,724
I forgot when I got there.

464
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:53,772
No, no.

465
00:22:53,886 --> 00:22:55,816
You are so passive-aggressive.

466
00:22:55,898 --> 00:22:56,502
Naked.

467
00:22:56,605 --> 00:22:58,018
I am naked in the shower.

468
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,993
They're just tampons, George.

469
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,612
I really needed tampons.

470
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:03,030
God!

471
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,477
I'm not riding in the same car with him.

472
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,725
Unless you're going like that, you're not riding with me.

473
00:23:07,781 --> 00:23:08,719
Where are the tampons?

474
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,574
He didn't buy them.

475
00:23:09,732 --> 00:23:10,955
You didn't buy them?

476
00:23:11,397 --> 00:23:13,198
Men don't buy tampons.

477
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,599
You are gonna have to get over the man thing, George.

478
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,016
We're women! We have vaginas!

479
00:23:18,098 --> 00:23:19,056
Get used to it.

480
00:23:21,502 --> 00:23:23,050
I am not your sister!

481
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,404
Grilled cheese again?

482
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:30,765
Cold pizza.

483
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:33,141
Is he awake?

484
00:23:33,393 --> 00:23:34,243
Even better.

485
00:23:34,944 --> 00:23:35,619
Really?

486
00:23:35,932 --> 00:23:37,268
Let's see what his nurse says.

487
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:41,384
Hi, Sona, Jorge. How are you this morning?

488
00:23:41,866 --> 00:23:43,888
Tell them what color my dress is, Jorge.

489
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:47,453
I'd know the answer to that even if I couldn't see.

490
00:23:56,807 --> 00:23:58,603
I'm taking the elevator. You take the stairs.

491
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:00,758
- I was going to, anyway.
- Good.

492
00:24:01,568 --> 00:24:02,290
Hold it.

493
00:24:03,773 --> 00:24:04,542
Thank you.

494
00:24:09,534 --> 00:24:10,523
What?

495
00:24:19,908 --> 00:24:23,194
You don't wake a patient like that.

496
00:24:23,537 --> 00:24:25,712
What do I have to do to get through to you?

497
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:29,687
Cut me some slack. I was on call last night. I didn't get much sleep.

498
00:24:29,822 --> 00:24:31,177
Oh, stop whining.

499
00:24:31,848 --> 00:24:34,357
You'd rather be here, and you know it.

500
00:24:35,304 --> 00:24:38,370
What you got waiting for you at home -- boyfriend?

501
00:24:39,547 --> 00:24:40,146
No.

502
00:24:41,366 --> 00:24:42,487
A girlfriend?

503
00:24:43,188 --> 00:24:43,812
No.

504
00:24:44,457 --> 00:24:46,767
A pet? Family?

505
00:24:50,018 --> 00:24:50,867
A bed.

506
00:24:51,478 --> 00:24:53,750
We got plenty of beds here.

507
00:24:54,462 --> 00:24:56,622
I don't feel sorry for you.

508
00:24:56,797 --> 00:24:59,500
This is who we are. This is our lives.

509
00:25:00,991 --> 00:25:02,941
You tell her, Dr. Burke.

510
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:12,434
Can I talk to you?

511
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,753
Hey, come on, come on, come on!

512
00:25:15,285 --> 00:25:16,977
- Let's go.
- What's going on?

513
00:25:19,195 --> 00:25:20,681
Excuse me. What's going on?

514
00:25:22,132 --> 00:25:23,693
George, stop.

515
00:25:33,006 --> 00:25:36,365
We have Bethany Whisper in our locker room.

516
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:41,336
Oh, boy, I guess they do airbrush out the tattoo, don't they?

517
00:25:49,601 --> 00:25:50,665
You want to see it?

518
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,815
You really want to see it?

519
00:25:53,714 --> 00:25:54,459
Fine.

520
00:25:54,756 --> 00:25:57,628
Let's look at that tattoo up close and personal, shall we?!

521
00:25:57,854 --> 00:26:00,645
And what are these? Oh, my god! Breasts!

522
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,778
How does anybody practice medicine hauling these things around?!

523
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,158
And what do we got back here?

524
00:26:06,225 --> 00:26:08,006
Let's see if I remember my anatomy.

525
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:11,412
Glutes, right?

526
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,481
Let's study them, shall we?

527
00:26:13,546 --> 00:26:17,120
Gather around and check out the booty that put Izzie Stevens through med school.

528
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,879
Have you had enough or should I continue?

529
00:26:20,941 --> 00:26:23,782
Because I have a few more very interesting tattoos.

530
00:26:26,956 --> 00:26:28,563
You want to call me Dr. Model?

531
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:30,964
That's fine.

532
00:26:31,488 --> 00:26:34,927
Just remember that while you're sitting on 200 grand of student loans...

533
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:37,350
I'm out of debt.

534
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:41,728
I'll take them down.

535
00:26:41,805 --> 00:26:42,675
Don't bother.

536
00:26:45,163 --> 00:26:45,782
Go!

537
00:26:51,003 --> 00:26:52,981
Can you tell me what you had for breakfast on monday?

538
00:26:53,575 --> 00:26:54,537
Cheese omelet...

539
00:26:55,732 --> 00:26:56,980
and on sunday...

540
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,417
and on saturday...

541
00:27:00,396 --> 00:27:01,685
and on friday.

542
00:27:02,858 --> 00:27:06,462
Sona gets up every morning and makes me a cheese omelet.

543
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,608
It's the only thing he likes.

544
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:10,743
It's the only thing you know how to cook.

545
00:27:11,947 --> 00:27:12,975
Okay, well, things look good.

546
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:16,489
But I need Jorge to get an M.R.I. this morning to check for residual bleeding.

547
00:27:17,045 --> 00:27:17,943
Okay?

548
00:27:28,797 --> 00:27:32,216
This is who I was. It has nothing to do with who I am now.

549
00:27:32,432 --> 00:27:34,372
I'm a physician, a surgeon.

550
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:38,735
And I am just as qualified as any other intern on this floor.

551
00:27:39,062 --> 00:27:41,469
So you're just gonna have to get over your chauvinist crap

552
00:27:41,571 --> 00:27:43,450
and allow me to do my job.

553
00:27:47,323 --> 00:27:49,584
I'm sure you're a very good doctor.

554
00:27:50,663 --> 00:27:52,319
Then what is your problem?

555
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:54,371
Look...

556
00:27:57,223 --> 00:27:59,420
I fantasized about you,

557
00:28:01,094 --> 00:28:03,607
about the woman in this photo, whoever she is.

558
00:28:05,374 --> 00:28:06,699
I'm not proud of it,

559
00:28:07,294 --> 00:28:08,340
but it's a fact.

560
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,883
Do you know what they're gonna do to me today?

561
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,047
I have cancer.

562
00:28:22,306 --> 00:28:25,122
And they're gonna lift up my legs and expose me to the world

563
00:28:25,194 --> 00:28:28,240
and cut out my prostate and my nerves --

564
00:28:29,603 --> 00:28:31,102
effectively neuter me.

565
00:28:34,594 --> 00:28:36,351
So is it so hard to understand

566
00:28:36,744 --> 00:28:40,477
that I don't want the woman who's in that photo to witness...

567
00:28:43,574 --> 00:28:45,136
my emasculation?

568
00:28:53,503 --> 00:28:54,906
Have you seen her overnight labs?

569
00:28:55,054 --> 00:28:55,842
I have.

570
00:28:55,945 --> 00:28:57,126
Did you check her liver panel?

571
00:28:57,267 --> 00:28:58,669
- They're not good.
- No, they suck.

572
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:00,660
She's choking on bile. She's jaundiced.

573
00:29:00,757 --> 00:29:01,935
A very sick woman.

574
00:29:02,386 --> 00:29:03,902
Why haven't you scheduled the whipple?

575
00:29:04,889 --> 00:29:06,401
Well, are you a surgeon now?

576
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:09,436
I'm her cruise director, pushing her around all day.

577
00:29:09,518 --> 00:29:11,734
The woman is circling the drain. We need to do something.

578
00:29:13,497 --> 00:29:15,858
- I'll take a look at her biopsy.
- Screw the biopsy.

579
00:29:15,944 --> 00:29:17,249
- Dr. Yang -- 
- Enough.

580
00:29:17,336 --> 00:29:19,651
You know -- you know, I-I -- you know what I think?

581
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,345
I think you never intended to do the whipple.

582
00:29:21,443 --> 00:29:23,589
I think this entire thing has been bull,

583
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,823
and you're behaving like the only reason she's in this hospital is to die.

584
00:29:49,605 --> 00:29:51,191
There. That's a tumor.

585
00:29:52,143 --> 00:29:53,884
It's midline near the hypothalamus.

586
00:29:57,887 --> 00:29:58,604
Damn.

587
00:30:02,547 --> 00:30:06,894
Best practice, probably to remove the tumor, "probably" because I can't get it all --

588
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,190
99% but not all of it.

589
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:14,128
Radiation and chemo, you're looking at maybe 5 to 10 good years.

590
00:30:17,455 --> 00:30:18,434
Let's do it.

591
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,701
You haven't heard the downside.

592
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:24,520
See, the tumor is located in a part of your brain

593
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,118
where your memory and your personality resides.

594
00:30:27,676 --> 00:30:30,306
And because of the fuzzy edges of this type of tumor,

595
00:30:30,983 --> 00:30:32,421
I have to cut out a lot.

596
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:36,646
Jorge, you stand a good chance of losing your memories,

597
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:39,933
of losing who you are.

598
00:30:40,476 --> 00:30:41,843
Is there any other way?

599
00:30:42,063 --> 00:30:45,320
The alternative is a gamma or cyberknife treatment with focus radiation.

600
00:30:45,403 --> 00:30:48,468
It's less evasive. There's little chance of memory loss

601
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:52,764
or him losing himself, but it would only give Jorge maybe three to five years.

602
00:30:52,887 --> 00:30:54,276
Three to five years?

603
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:01,652
This is an incredibly difficult decision.

604
00:31:03,053 --> 00:31:06,665
If you have any more questions or you need to talk to me, I'm here, okay?

605
00:31:25,614 --> 00:31:26,371
Hey.

606
00:31:27,058 --> 00:31:28,640
I told my mother about you.

607
00:31:29,326 --> 00:31:31,185
She remembers you very well.

608
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,590
Of course she would.

609
00:31:34,816 --> 00:31:38,833
Ellis Grey never forgot a thing.

610
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,431
I'm sorry.

611
00:31:53,795 --> 00:31:55,504
It's not really funny.

612
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,461
It's not funny, but...

613
00:31:57,972 --> 00:31:59,473
What's her diagnosis?

614
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,579
Alzheimer's...

615
00:32:04,927 --> 00:32:06,079
Early onset.

616
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,406
And she doesn't want anyone to know.

617
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,292
No.

618
00:32:14,357 --> 00:32:16,153
She's in a nursing home, and...

619
00:32:17,147 --> 00:32:19,953
I'm the only person she'll allow to see her.

620
00:32:22,571 --> 00:32:28,580
But if I know Ellis Grey, she made the nursing home sign a contract to that effect.

621
00:32:29,404 --> 00:32:31,064
You know my mother well.

622
00:32:32,487 --> 00:32:33,751
What a bitch.

623
00:32:39,687 --> 00:32:41,585
The woman's life was this hospital.

624
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:44,642
It was her home. It's a sweet thing for them to do.

625
00:32:44,744 --> 00:32:47,089
It's a waste of a bed, and it's a waste of my time.

626
00:32:47,243 --> 00:32:48,450
Who are we talking about?

627
00:32:49,004 --> 00:32:51,154
Miss Fallon. They brought her here to die.

628
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,684
Wouldn't you want them to do the same thing for you?

629
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:56,301
No, I'd want the doctors to do everything they could.

630
00:32:56,356 --> 00:32:58,436
I want them to cut me open until the minute I die.

631
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:01,467
Sometimes doing everything can be worse than doing nothing.

632
00:33:04,661 --> 00:33:06,167
You are 8 feet tall.

633
00:33:06,468 --> 00:33:08,163
Your boobs are perfect.

634
00:33:08,266 --> 00:33:09,715
Your hair is down to there.

635
00:33:10,785 --> 00:33:13,970
If I were you, I would walk around naked all the time.

636
00:33:14,461 --> 00:33:16,745
I wouldn't -- I wouldn't have a job.

637
00:33:16,826 --> 00:33:18,829
I wouldn't have skills. I wouldn't even know how to read.

638
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:19,919
I'd just be...

639
00:33:20,774 --> 00:33:21,634
naked.

640
00:33:23,073 --> 00:33:24,185
It's makeup.

641
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:25,699
It's retouching.

642
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,670
You get that we hate you, right?

643
00:33:31,025 --> 00:33:32,023
Bailey again.

644
00:33:33,328 --> 00:33:36,944
You know what? Any patient who spanks to his doctor's pictures forfeits his rights.

645
00:33:37,026 --> 00:33:39,227
You're seriously not gonna give up the prostatectomy, are you?

646
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:41,367
Izzie?

647
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:44,290
Oh, forget it.

648
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:48,689
You know, sometimes it is actually, you know, painful to be around you.

649
00:33:53,902 --> 00:33:55,186
Where the hell have you been?

650
00:33:55,402 --> 00:33:58,488
When I page, you answer. It's not that difficult to understand.

651
00:33:58,591 --> 00:34:01,315
O'Malley answered his page. He's doing your prep.

652
00:34:09,825 --> 00:34:11,939
If I hear the words Bethany Whisper one more time --

653
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,685
I can't, okay?

654
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:16,296
I just... can't.

655
00:34:16,475 --> 00:34:17,940
He doesn't want me in there.

656
00:34:18,038 --> 00:34:20,346
No, what he wants is to not have cancer.

657
00:34:20,422 --> 00:34:22,547
What he wants is to be saved.

658
00:34:22,641 --> 00:34:25,179
You want to stay in the scrub room, that's your choice.

659
00:34:28,643 --> 00:34:31,036
All right. I'll do my best.

660
00:34:34,401 --> 00:34:35,973
Jorge and Sona want the surgery.

661
00:34:36,694 --> 00:34:38,087
They want you to cut it out?

662
00:34:39,038 --> 00:34:40,073
It's their decision.

663
00:34:56,902 --> 00:34:59,319
They were never gonna operate.

664
00:34:59,422 --> 00:35:00,528
You could have told me.

665
00:35:01,942 --> 00:35:04,030
What fun would that have been?

666
00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:09,118
Think of it as a hazing ritual.

667
00:35:11,557 --> 00:35:12,825
Welcome...

668
00:35:13,646 --> 00:35:15,161
Liz, don't talk. Don't talk.

669
00:35:24,301 --> 00:35:27,982
Liz? Liz, stay... Liz, stay with me.

670
00:35:29,882 --> 00:35:30,868
Stay with me, Liz.

671
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,846
Sona?

672
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:01,943
Let's go.

673
00:36:02,173 --> 00:36:03,223
Right -- right down.

674
00:36:04,034 --> 00:36:05,092
Pick up the bagger.

675
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:07,247
Push epi and atropine. You got it.

676
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:08,178
Somebody page Burke.

677
00:36:08,942 --> 00:36:10,570
- I'll start ventilation.
- Start that line.

678
00:36:11,742 --> 00:36:12,700
She's DNR.

679
00:36:12,912 --> 00:36:15,700
- One, two -- 
- She's DNR. Do not resuscitate!

680
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,437
- Dr. Yang!
- Come on, people!

681
00:36:17,544 --> 00:36:18,834
Push another epi! Come on!

682
00:36:19,115 --> 00:36:21,199
You need to consider what you'll lose.

683
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:25,101
What good is five years if he doesn't joke about your omelets

684
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,513
and he can't remember seeing you in that red dress?

685
00:36:27,595 --> 00:36:29,032
It's still five more years.

686
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,282
You don't understand.

687
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,898
He'll be there, but he won't be Jorge.

688
00:36:32,996 --> 00:36:35,520
- He won't even recognize you.
- This is our business.

689
00:36:36,057 --> 00:36:38,350
You have no idea what this will do to you.

690
00:36:38,465 --> 00:36:42,115
Isn't 5 good years better than 10 bad ones?

691
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:43,650
Meredith, what the hell are you doing?

692
00:36:43,774 --> 00:36:45,090
She needs to understand.

693
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:46,488
I do understand.

694
00:36:47,281 --> 00:36:50,574
You think that I'm being selfish, that I don't want to give him up.

695
00:36:50,723 --> 00:36:52,949
- I don't.
- This is Jorge's decision.

696
00:36:53,298 --> 00:36:55,704
And if that means 10 bad years for me, fine.

697
00:36:55,785 --> 00:36:58,838
I'll give him those years because I will give him whatever he wants.

698
00:36:58,939 --> 00:37:00,910
Look, I am so sorry, Sona. Just please forgive her.

699
00:37:01,024 --> 00:37:05,621
And if he doesn't remember me, if he doesn't remember what we are,

700
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,115
he's still my Jorge.

701
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,833
And I'll remember for us both.

702
00:37:11,311 --> 00:37:12,278
Okay, all right.

703
00:37:16,937 --> 00:37:19,118
Five, three, one, two.

704
00:37:19,217 --> 00:37:20,710
- What the hell are you two doing?
- We lost pulse.

705
00:37:21,027 --> 00:37:21,842
Let her go.

706
00:37:22,077 --> 00:37:23,711
- Where's that epi?
- Let her go!

707
00:37:23,889 --> 00:37:25,411
She's DNR. Let her go down.

708
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:28,036
...Four, five. One, two...

709
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:30,247
- Do not resuscitate.
- All right.

710
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:31,902
- It is on her chart.
- All right!

711
00:37:31,994 --> 00:37:33,049
Let her go down.

712
00:37:33,506 --> 00:37:35,097
Let her go down.

713
00:37:53,642 --> 00:37:54,743
Where are they?

714
00:37:54,907 --> 00:37:58,271
He's resecting the prostate, coming up on the distal nerve.

715
00:38:00,185 --> 00:38:01,025
You said...

716
00:38:02,023 --> 00:38:03,729
"I am not your sister."

717
00:38:05,557 --> 00:38:07,184
Do you feel like I was emasculating you?

718
00:38:07,236 --> 00:38:08,920
No. No.

719
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,971
I'm too masculine to be emasculated.

720
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,941
I'm sorry.

721
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:23,957
Guess you put Dr. Model to rest.

722
00:38:24,783 --> 00:38:25,992
I guess I did.

723
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:31,567
Dr. Victor, I'm sorry. But these are viable nerves. We should save them.

724
00:38:31,668 --> 00:38:33,380
It'll take at least an hour longer,

725
00:38:33,513 --> 00:38:36,005
and we might not get it all.

726
00:38:36,241 --> 00:38:38,330
You know, they call him Limp Harry.

727
00:38:41,501 --> 00:38:44,458
But his prognosis with chemo is nearly as good.

728
00:38:44,552 --> 00:38:48,555
And, frankly, if you're worried about missing your tea time, I'd be more than happy to finish.

729
00:38:48,647 --> 00:38:49,619
Dr. Stevens.

730
00:38:50,198 --> 00:38:51,304
Can we help you?

731
00:38:51,401 --> 00:38:52,691
I'm sorry, Dr. Bailey.

732
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,447
Dr. Victor, I agree with her.

733
00:38:54,715 --> 00:38:55,867
You just can't --

734
00:38:57,525 --> 00:38:59,168
You have to save the nerves.

735
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:01,083
- What?
- The nerves -- you have to save them.

736
00:39:01,145 --> 00:39:02,226
Dr. Stevens, I can handle this.

737
00:39:02,322 --> 00:39:04,652
No, you told me the most important thing is giving the patient what they want.

738
00:39:04,713 --> 00:39:06,584
What Humphrey wants is his erection.

739
00:39:07,196 --> 00:39:08,216
She's yours.

740
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,666
You get her out.

741
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:10,965
Can't do that, sir.

742
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:13,341
You know how these young puppies are.

743
00:39:14,544 --> 00:39:16,930
I'm going to tell Richard about both of you.

744
00:39:17,007 --> 00:39:21,287
You do that. In the meantime, let's pretend it's you on this table and give this a try.

745
00:39:57,107 --> 00:39:58,265
You ever called one?

746
00:40:03,837 --> 00:40:04,505
No.

747
00:40:07,225 --> 00:40:08,350
Call it, doctor.

748
00:40:11,191 --> 00:40:13,021
Time of death, 11:43.

749
00:40:24,579 --> 00:40:27,661
I wish there were a rule book for intimacy.

750
00:40:31,573 --> 00:40:35,722
Some kind of a guide that could tell you when you've crossed the line.

751
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:44,498
You can't lose it like that.

752
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,190
It would be nice if you could see it coming.

753
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,116
I'll get her.

754
00:40:51,606 --> 00:40:52,531
Let her go.

755
00:40:53,157 --> 00:40:55,230
And I don't know how you fit it on a map.

756
00:40:55,757 --> 00:40:57,269
We have to let her go.

757
00:41:08,236 --> 00:41:13,574
Of course, now you know every time he gets a rise, he'll be thinking of you.

758
00:41:14,511 --> 00:41:16,386
You take it where you can get it...

759
00:41:19,746 --> 00:41:22,523
and keep it as long as you can.

760
00:41:34,188 --> 00:41:35,610
And as for rules...

761
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,122
Better not be using my toothbrush.

762
00:41:40,821 --> 00:41:41,587
I'm not.

763
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:44,310
Maybe there are none.

764
00:41:52,549 --> 00:41:58,651
Maybe the rules of intimacy are something you have to define for yourself.

765
00:42:10,827 --> 00:42:14,380
