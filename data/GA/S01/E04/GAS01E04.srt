1
00:00:02,793 --> 00:00:05,626
Intimacy is a four-syllable word for

2
00:00:05,801 --> 00:00:07,565
"here are my heart and soul.

3
00:00:07,938 --> 00:00:09,607
Please grind them into hamburger

4
00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:11,078
and enjoy."

5
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:14,756
It's both desired and feared,

6
00:00:15,943 --> 00:00:17,320
difficult to live with...

7
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:18,504
Uh, excuse me!

8
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:19,834
Excuse me!

9
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:22,257
...and impossible to live without.

10
00:00:25,876 --> 00:00:27,469
Is that my toothbrush?!

11
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,138
Intimacy also comes attached to life's three R's -

12
00:00:44,968 --> 00:00:49,092
relatives, romance, and roommates.

13
00:00:51,227 --> 00:00:54,581
- Coffee?
- There are some things you can't escape.

14
00:00:55,773 --> 00:00:59,018
And other things you just don't want to know.

15
00:00:59,244 --> 00:01:00,186
Hello, Kitty.

16
00:01:05,727 --> 00:01:08,224
You don't understand. Me gonads, you ovaries.

17
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:10,057
Oh, that reminds me.

18
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,280
We are out of tampons.

19
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:14,855
You're parading through the bathroom in your
underwear when I'm naked in the shower.

20
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,181
Can you add it to your list, please?

21
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,583
- What?!
- Tampons!

22
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:19,539
It's to the list. It's your turn.

23
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:21,536
I am a man!

24
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:23,691
I don't buy girl products!

25
00:01:23,814 --> 00:01:26,215
I don't want you walking in
while I'm in the shower,

26
00:01:26,308 --> 00:01:27,992
and I don't want to see you in your underwear.

27
00:01:28,059 --> 00:01:29,452
It doesn't bother me, okay?

28
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,034
Look at me in my underwear, George.

29
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:32,888
Take your time. It's no big deal.

30
00:01:35,483 --> 00:01:38,550
You are the first person they see in the morning.

31
00:01:38,643 --> 00:01:40,603
You say please. You say thank you.

32
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,993
You apologize for waking them up.

33
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:45,396
You make them feel good about you.

34
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:46,776
Why is that important?

35
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:49,747
'Cause then they'll talk to you
and tell you what's wrong.

36
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,301
Why is that important?

37
00:01:51,365 --> 00:01:54,924
Because then you can tell your attending
what they need to know during rounds.

38
00:01:54,996 --> 00:01:57,029
And why is that important?

39
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,156
Because if you make your resident look bad,

40
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:03,249
she'll torture you until you beg for your mama.

41
00:02:03,828 --> 00:02:07,643
Now get out there. I want
pre-rounds done by 5:30 A.M.

42
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,484
Morning, Dr. Model.

43
00:02:10,028 --> 00:02:11,114
Dr. Evil Spawn.

44
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,577
Ooh, nice tat.

45
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,605
They airbrush that out for the catalogs?

46
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:16,520
I don't know.

47
00:02:16,854 --> 00:02:19,061
What do they do for the 6-6-6 on your skull?

48
00:02:19,642 --> 00:02:21,554
I'd better get good patients today.

49
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:25,850
Yesterday I had two guys with colostomies who
needed dressing changes every 15 minutes.

50
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:27,012
I'm gonna be in surgery.

51
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:28,184
Today's my day.

52
00:02:28,297 --> 00:02:29,060
On what?

53
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,114
Like I'd tell you.

54
00:02:30,386 --> 00:02:31,276
What do you know?

55
00:02:31,507 --> 00:02:34,010
I know that I was here at 4:00, and
you didn't get here till 4:30.

56
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:34,988
Tell me.

57
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:36,401
No.

58
00:02:37,704 --> 00:02:40,442
I'm not the intern who's screwing an attending.

59
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:43,766
I am not screw-

60
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:46,048
You're here early.

61
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,819
I have chordotomy at 5:00. I'll be out at 6:00.

62
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:49,833
I thought I might buy you
breakfast before your rounds.

63
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:50,820
I've already eaten.

64
00:02:50,892 --> 00:02:51,620
What did you have?

65
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:52,664
None of your business.

66
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:53,754
You a cereal person?

67
00:02:53,984 --> 00:02:55,894
Straight out of the box? Or
are you all fruit and fibery?

68
00:02:56,662 --> 00:02:58,198
Pancakes? Do you like pancakes.

69
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,057
Fine, leftover grilled cheese.

70
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,920
- Curiosity satisfied?
- That's sad. It's pathetic.

71
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:04,900
A good day starts with a good breakfast.

72
00:03:05,038 --> 00:03:07,435
Look, I'm not being seen
with you in this hospital.

73
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,514
Learn it, live it. It's unprofessional.

74
00:03:09,698 --> 00:03:11,638
Think of it as an attending getting
to know one of his interns.

75
00:03:11,715 --> 00:03:13,415
- He slept with the intern.
- Barely knew her.

76
00:03:13,548 --> 00:03:15,859
- And its just stay that way.
- You want me to be professional?

77
00:03:16,093 --> 00:03:17,916
- I'll be professional.
- That's what I want.

78
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:18,879
Then that's what you get.

79
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:20,547
You're gonna be late for your chordotomy.

80
00:03:22,242 --> 00:03:23,983
Nice talking to you, Dr. Grey.

81
00:03:27,096 --> 00:03:29,973
Anyone seen the floor chart on the new admission?

82
00:03:34,597 --> 00:03:37,602
You always come in like that, bang the light on?

83
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:38,738
You're Elizabeth Fallon?

84
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:40,849
What does my chart say?

85
00:03:41,575 --> 00:03:43,121
It says you used to be a nurse here.

86
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:45,000
A scrub nurse.

87
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:47,976
And that you have abdominal mass
consistent with pancreatic cancer.

88
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:52,348
Oh, and you are hoping they're
gonna give me a whipple...

89
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:56,147
pancreatic duodectomy.

90
00:03:56,557 --> 00:04:02,809
This hospital sees those one
maybe once every six months.

91
00:04:03,555 --> 00:04:05,712
That's why you got here at 4:30, huh?

92
00:04:05,865 --> 00:04:06,606
4:00.

93
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:10,028
Grab my chart before anybody else could see it.

94
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:13,950
Impress Dr. Burke with your pre-round exam

95
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:18,127
so you'd be the logical intern
for him to ask to scrub in.

96
00:04:18,645 --> 00:04:21,445
I know all the tricks, doctor.

97
00:04:21,517 --> 00:04:23,867
Yang - Cristina Yang.

98
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:26,843
I'll call you Cristina.

99
00:04:27,328 --> 00:04:29,488
You call me nurse Fallon.

100
00:04:30,172 --> 00:04:31,096
Mr. Humphrey?

101
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,126
Mr. Humphrey, I'm sorry to wake you.

102
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:37,778
Come on.

103
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:40,375
What time is it?

104
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:41,734
10 after 5:00.

105
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:43,770
I'm sorry. I just need to do a brief exam.

106
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,130
If you could sit up for one moment.

107
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:52,370
Thanks.

108
00:04:53,046 --> 00:04:56,702
This might be a little bit cold,
so just take a deep breath.

109
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,136
If you could just take a deep breath.

110
00:04:58,244 --> 00:04:59,353
You're not a doctor.

111
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:01,138
I'm Dr. Stevens, but you can call me Izzie.

112
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,964
I'll be helping Dr. Bailey
with your biopsy this morning.

113
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:04,336
No, I don't think so, no.

114
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,332
Mr. Humphrey, this will just take a moment.

115
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:08,995
No, get me Dr. Bailey or Dr. Victor.

116
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:11,612
- I just need to do a brief -
- You don't need to do anything.

117
00:05:12,436 --> 00:05:13,261
Is this you?

118
00:05:14,843 --> 00:05:15,533
H uh?

119
00:05:16,045 --> 00:05:16,992
Is this you?

120
00:05:18,856 --> 00:05:19,967
It is, isn't it?

121
00:05:20,546 --> 00:05:21,570
You know, get out of my room.

122
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:23,055
- Mr. Humphrey -
- Get out of my room.

123
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:31,046
There need to be some rules.

124
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:35,159
So, what, we can walk around in our
underwear on alternate tuesdays

125
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:37,974
or you could see bras but not panties?

126
00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:40,115
Or are you talking amish rules?

127
00:05:40,182 --> 00:05:42,536
Because if you think you're gonna
get Izzie to cover herself -

128
00:05:42,655 --> 00:05:44,842
The amount of flesh exposed is not the point.

129
00:05:45,415 --> 00:05:47,360
You have to do something. It's your house.

130
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:49,357
- It's my mother's house.
- Meredith...

131
00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:54,251
Do you like Izzie? Is that what this is about?
Do you have a crush on Izzie?

132
00:05:54,358 --> 00:05:56,714
No. Izzie? No. I don't like Izzie.

133
00:05:56,878 --> 00:05:59,791
Izzie - no. I - she's not
the one I'm attracted to.

134
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,394
Not the one. So there's a one.

135
00:06:01,506 --> 00:06:02,202
This is not -

136
00:06:03,074 --> 00:06:05,178
Look, there just have to be some rules.

137
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:08,127
O'Malley, Grey, get Karev and head down to trauma.

138
00:06:08,204 --> 00:06:09,182
Shepherd needs you.

139
00:06:09,294 --> 00:06:10,268
Shepherd's in surgery.

140
00:06:10,415 --> 00:06:12,038
He got pulled before he could start.

141
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:23,865
Those look like -

142
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:25,653
Nails.

143
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:06,326
I can't see my hands.

144
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,528
Oh, my god. He's conscious.

145
00:07:07,638 --> 00:07:10,212
Breathe deeply, George. You won't pass out.

146
00:07:10,277 --> 00:07:12,481
Use 4 milligrams of morphine. Titrate up to 10.

147
00:07:12,888 --> 00:07:14,665
You know what? I don't want him to move.

148
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:15,854
- I can't see.
- It's okay.

149
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:17,584
We need you to be very still, Mr...

150
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,452
Cruz - Jorge Cruz.

151
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,968
He tripped and fell down a flight
of stairs holding a nail gun.

152
00:07:22,865 --> 00:07:25,018
Somehow he managed to miss a blood vessel.

153
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,054
Optic nerve's been affected. Can you feel this?

154
00:07:29,194 --> 00:07:30,744
Numbness on his right side.

155
00:07:30,871 --> 00:07:31,943
What's our immediate concern?

156
00:07:32,014 --> 00:07:32,802
Infection.

157
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,468
Right. I'm gonna be pulling these nails
out in the next half-hour. I need a C.T.

158
00:07:36,535 --> 00:07:37,584
C.T.s are down.

159
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,437
- What?
- They exchanged them out last night.

160
00:07:39,503 --> 00:07:41,291
Computer's crashed - have
them back up by 1:00.

161
00:07:41,403 --> 00:07:42,485
Typical. What are the options?

162
00:07:42,556 --> 00:07:43,865
- An M.R.I.
- No brilliant.

163
00:07:43,954 --> 00:07:46,565
The man's got nails in his head.
Let's put him in a giant magnet.

164
00:07:46,652 --> 00:07:49,088
You want films from three axis
points and a c-arm in surgery.

165
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:52,064
Excellent. Dig up research and find
out if this has ever happened before.

166
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:53,207
My wife.

167
00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:54,465
My wife, my wife.

168
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:56,431
You wife is on the way, Mr. Cruz.

169
00:07:56,815 --> 00:07:59,482
Stay with him, keep him
calm, and look for changes.

170
00:08:01,752 --> 00:08:02,923
I can't see.

171
00:08:03,226 --> 00:08:06,000
55-year-old woman with
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

172
00:08:06,082 --> 00:08:08,791
Has had radiation therapy
to reduce the tumor load.

173
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:10,854
Rates her abdominal pain 3 out of 10.

174
00:08:10,936 --> 00:08:12,749
Positive nausea, but no vomiting.

175
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:15,817
Diarrhea, hematochezia, melena,

176
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:19,486
afebrile with t-max 37-2 and stable vital signs.

177
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:21,703
Lab significant for a total ability of 7

178
00:08:21,785 --> 00:08:23,332
and elevated liver enzymes.

179
00:08:23,424 --> 00:08:25,605
Thank you, Dr. Yang.

180
00:08:25,698 --> 00:08:27,903
Aggressive little witch, isn't she?

181
00:08:27,996 --> 00:08:30,761
She stole my chart during pre-rounds

182
00:08:30,847 --> 00:08:32,747
so she could scrub in on my surgery.

183
00:08:32,855 --> 00:08:34,093
She's hoping for a whipple.

184
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:37,244
Well, actually, Liz, I was gonna
give you to Meredith Grey.

185
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,609
Ellis' daughter?

186
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:41,533
Yes, she's an intern this year.

187
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:43,510
Thought you'd have something to talk about.

188
00:08:43,694 --> 00:08:45,163
Oh, I doubt that.

189
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:48,891
I was Ellis' scrub nurse for 18 years,

190
00:08:48,957 --> 00:08:52,075
practically lived with that woman.
I didn't meet that daughter once.

191
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:57,811
Well, anyway, Shepherd has her on
the guy with the nails in his head.

192
00:08:57,898 --> 00:08:59,377
There's a guy with nails in his head?

193
00:08:59,612 --> 00:09:00,601
Seven of them.

194
00:09:00,692 --> 00:09:02,408
Shot himself in the head with a nail gun.

195
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,765
Nail nails?

196
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,467
16 pennies, 31/2 inches long.

197
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,932
And he's still alive?

198
00:09:08,102 --> 00:09:09,074
Fully conscious.

199
00:09:09,172 --> 00:09:10,846
Should be a pretty interesting surgery.

200
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,170
But I guess you've got the whipple.

201
00:09:16,364 --> 00:09:19,867
I'm gonna need a full blood
work-up and abdominal C.T.

202
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:21,383
C.T.s are down this morning.

203
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:24,056
Then an M.R.I. She needs an enema,

204
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:27,947
an ERCP for a stent, and
brush biopsy this afternoon.

205
00:09:28,178 --> 00:09:29,195
Take care of her.

206
00:09:29,427 --> 00:09:31,383
Liz is an institution around here.

207
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,053
Good call, doctor.

208
00:09:35,428 --> 00:09:37,721
Grey's got the human 2x4,

209
00:09:37,896 --> 00:09:41,294
and you have the institution in need of an enema.

210
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:46,723
You'd say your health's been good recently?

211
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:48,744
Maybe some headaches.

212
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,096
Nothing compared to now.

213
00:09:51,868 --> 00:09:54,085
Sona - that's my wife.

214
00:09:54,183 --> 00:09:55,392
Sona - she'll say,

215
00:09:55,766 --> 00:09:58,344
"why you think they call it a gun, moron?"

216
00:09:58,996 --> 00:10:00,664
She hates the damn things.

217
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:02,170
With good reason.

218
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:06,778
Baby?

219
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:07,832
Sona.

220
00:10:10,922 --> 00:10:13,385
You are in so much trouble.

221
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:19,621
Get a history from her before you scrub in.

222
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:20,387
Okay.

223
00:10:20,455 --> 00:10:21,297
Thank you.

224
00:10:24,462 --> 00:10:25,517
23.

225
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:29,757
People have been accidently shot
in the head with nails 23 times.

226
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,384
One was attempted suicide - doesn't count.

227
00:10:32,496 --> 00:10:35,517
Oh, so he pointed a nail gun
at his head on purpose?

228
00:10:35,614 --> 00:10:36,802
That makes me feel better.

229
00:10:37,176 --> 00:10:38,281
So, uh...

230
00:10:38,891 --> 00:10:41,471
Grey and Stevens really walk
around in their underwear?

231
00:10:44,665 --> 00:10:47,544
Not all the time. I mean,
some of the time, you know.

232
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:49,991
But not all the time.

233
00:10:50,088 --> 00:10:51,302
Sexy underwear?

234
00:10:53,355 --> 00:10:55,050
Yeah. I mean...

235
00:10:56,018 --> 00:10:58,408
And they just, uh, let you look at them?

236
00:11:00,905 --> 00:11:01,916
Well, uh...

237
00:11:02,807 --> 00:11:03,590
yeah.

238
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:04,917
Like sisters.

239
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:07,630
No, well, not like sisters.

240
00:11:08,422 --> 00:11:10,666
I don't think of them as sisters.

241
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:12,545
But they're not coming on to you.

242
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,485
Not exactly.

243
00:11:14,604 --> 00:11:16,473
They don't expect you to do anything.

244
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:17,742
No...

245
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,062
But...

246
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:21,172
Like sisters.

247
00:11:22,774 --> 00:11:24,106
Just like sisters.

248
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:34,274
Is he prepped?

249
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,274
I think they're doing it right now.

250
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,272
You think?

251
00:11:39,476 --> 00:11:41,643
He's having a prostate biopsy.

252
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,060
Trust me. If you'd been in there, you'd know.

253
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:50,202
Okay, Mr. Humphrey. We're gonna get started.

254
00:11:55,835 --> 00:11:57,494
Get her out of here.

255
00:11:57,632 --> 00:11:59,691
I want her out of here! Just get her out of here!

256
00:11:59,897 --> 00:12:02,898
Go! Now! Just you go! Now!

257
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:07,406
Hey, relax! Relax, Mr. Humphrey.

258
00:12:09,648 --> 00:12:11,374
Will he be able to see again?

259
00:12:11,758 --> 00:12:14,180
We won't know until the nails come out.

260
00:12:14,554 --> 00:12:16,429
Did he tell you he takes photos?

261
00:12:17,108 --> 00:12:18,650
Beautiful photos.

262
00:12:18,747 --> 00:12:19,633
It's his hobby.

263
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:24,171
I just got him a new digital camera,
and now he can't stop, you know?

264
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:27,514
He always has it out - always
taking pictures of me.

265
00:12:27,722 --> 00:12:29,930
Jorge said he's been having headaches.

266
00:12:30,012 --> 00:12:32,372
Can you tell me about them? Have they been recent?

267
00:12:34,902 --> 00:12:37,834
I'm not sure. Maybe the last couple of months.

268
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,167
Have you seen him experience any
dizziness or disorientation?

269
00:12:46,538 --> 00:12:48,131
Yes, yes, I have.

270
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:50,875
Okay.

271
00:12:55,893 --> 00:12:58,055
You want to tell me what that was all about?

272
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,111
Nothing.

273
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:01,817
He's probably just crazy or something.

274
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:12,190
- Bethany Whisper.
- What?

275
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,613
Bethany Whisper.

276
00:13:14,038 --> 00:13:17,296
I did a new Bethany Whisper lingerie ad.
He saw it in a magazine.

277
00:13:17,372 --> 00:13:19,743
- You got time to pose for magazines?
- No, the shoot was last year.

278
00:13:19,805 --> 00:13:20,726
It just came out.

279
00:13:20,828 --> 00:13:23,454
- So because he saw you in a thong...
- No, it wasn't a thong.

280
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:25,164
...you're hiding out in the hallway.

281
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:27,289
It might be easier if you assign another intern.

282
00:13:27,382 --> 00:13:28,901
Easy is not in your job description.

283
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,910
You are a doctor. He is a patient.

284
00:13:31,012 --> 00:13:33,439
He's your patient. Biopsy these.

285
00:13:33,603 --> 00:13:36,521
If they come back positive, I
expect to see you in surgery.

286
00:13:38,158 --> 00:13:40,812
Hey, you're on this. You understand me?

287
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:52,045
Vertiginous or light-headedness?

288
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:55,200
Light-headed. Sometimes he'd have
to brace himself to get out of bed.

289
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:57,579
Could be a million things - simple orthostasis.

290
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,911
What?

291
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:01,082
What made him fall downstairs with a nail gun?

292
00:14:01,158 --> 00:14:02,219
He said he tripped.

293
00:14:02,331 --> 00:14:04,518
Just because you hear
hoofbeats, don't assume zebras.

294
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,713
Something caused him to lose
consciousness and fall down the stairs.

295
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:09,106
He could have a tumor.

296
00:14:09,351 --> 00:14:13,155
Look, I have no idea why this guy's still
alive let alone moving and talking.

297
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:14,583
Not a clue.

298
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:17,968
Let's just get him through this before we
start digging around for something else.

299
00:14:19,955 --> 00:14:20,748
Shepherd.

300
00:14:21,808 --> 00:14:22,924
23 cases?

301
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:24,455
One was attempted suicide.

302
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:26,145
That doesn't count. Talk to me about procedure.

303
00:14:26,217 --> 00:14:28,033
Biggest problems were bleeding and infection.

304
00:14:28,105 --> 00:14:30,220
But the odds improved the shorter surgery times.

305
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:33,389
Bottom line was get them out
quickly and watch for bleeding.

306
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,699
I got it. Other words, I'm on my own.

307
00:14:44,464 --> 00:14:45,397
You coming?

308
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,998
Dude, I don't need an escort.

309
00:14:49,082 --> 00:14:49,764
Go.

310
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:51,639
Go ahead.

311
00:14:54,674 --> 00:14:56,276
Well, well, well.

312
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,640
Dr. Bethany Whisper.

313
00:15:00,772 --> 00:15:02,021
That's so nice.

314
00:15:21,314 --> 00:15:23,882
She had this thing for red when we met.

315
00:15:24,906 --> 00:15:28,530
Red car, red dresses, red hats.

316
00:15:28,772 --> 00:15:30,723
Personally, I hated the color.

317
00:15:31,435 --> 00:15:32,724
Too obvious, you know?

318
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:35,986
But a couple years ago,

319
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:38,207
I took her up to the mountains.

320
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,065
She was in a red dress,

321
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:44,650
and there was this field of red...

322
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:46,943
poppies, I think.

323
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,184
And she jumped out of the car

324
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:51,879
and ran into them

325
00:15:52,678 --> 00:15:54,188
and started laughing -

326
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:57,194
laughing at all the red.

327
00:16:03,425 --> 00:16:07,991
The good news is it hasn't spread
from his prostate to his lymph nodes.

328
00:16:08,242 --> 00:16:11,678
With a radical prostatectomy,
we could probably get it all.

329
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:13,271
Good prognosis.

330
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,337
Spare some nerves? Give him a
chance at a normal sex life?

331
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,880
Young puppies like to take chances with cancer.

332
00:16:20,034 --> 00:16:23,030
Old dogs like me, we do what works.

333
00:16:23,101 --> 00:16:24,453
Yes, sir, of course.

334
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:25,610
We on the schedule tomorrow?

335
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:26,746
10:00 A.M.

336
00:16:26,823 --> 00:16:29,434
Good. Maybe I can squeeze in a round.

337
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:32,614
An ass who deals in asses.

338
00:16:33,546 --> 00:16:35,090
We call him Limp Harry.

339
00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:37,178
He never spares the nerves.

340
00:16:41,456 --> 00:16:46,879
As you can see, the patient has shot
seven nails directly into the skull

341
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,840
without doing significant damage
other than the optic nerve,

342
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:54,169
and we may be able to save that.

343
00:16:55,158 --> 00:16:59,633
The idea is to remove the nails at
exactly the angle they entered.

344
00:17:00,196 --> 00:17:05,690
Any wiggle, and we risk doing more
damage than when they went in.

345
00:17:06,264 --> 00:17:07,078
Where are they?

346
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:07,892
Move over.

347
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:09,842
They're just pulling them out.

348
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:12,030
Hey, I heard you got a whipple.

349
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:14,588
A maybe whipple. Burke is running my butt off.

350
00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:16,571
Oh, man. Look at those films!

351
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:19,274
It's hell-raiser.

352
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:33,189
- Gel foam.
- Here you go.

353
00:17:35,248 --> 00:17:36,958
There goes the third grade.

354
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:38,684
Dr. Yang...

355
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,015
Did you put in the blood work?

356
00:17:43,613 --> 00:17:45,402
Oh, right before I got here.

357
00:17:45,608 --> 00:17:49,569
Hmm. Take her to radiology for the M.R.I.
Beep me when you're done.

358
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:55,021
You want the whipple, right?

359
00:17:57,627 --> 00:17:58,287
Yeah.

360
00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:03,991
- Hey.
- Hey.

361
00:18:05,082 --> 00:18:07,160
Here. My share of the grocery money.

362
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,434
- When are you going?
- Tonight.

363
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:12,317
- Okay, seriously, George. Please don't -
- Yeah, could we not talk about it here?

364
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,986
What - tampons?

365
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:19,138
Did you not hear a word I said?

366
00:18:20,263 --> 00:18:21,656
You're a man. We know.

367
00:18:24,524 --> 00:18:27,323
Talk about shrinking the salamander.

368
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:38,285
I always divided surgeons into two categories -

369
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:42,767
those that remember the names of
their patients and those who didn't.

370
00:18:42,853 --> 00:18:45,501
They all remember their surgeries, of course.

371
00:18:45,617 --> 00:18:47,532
Every damn suture.

372
00:18:48,198 --> 00:18:50,159
But the good ones remember the names, right?

373
00:18:50,246 --> 00:18:51,516
I didn't say that.

374
00:18:51,594 --> 00:18:56,653
Now, some of the best ones, you know,
distance themselves on purpose.

375
00:18:56,775 --> 00:19:02,309
They believe that the personal
stuff clouds the medicine.

376
00:19:02,447 --> 00:19:03,548
- Hi, Liz.
- Hey.

377
00:19:03,688 --> 00:19:04,541
But?

378
00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:07,993
I'm waiting for the but. I'm sure
there's a big, fat qualifier coming.

379
00:19:08,878 --> 00:19:10,778
- Hey, Liz.
- Hey!

380
00:19:10,904 --> 00:19:12,861
- Looking good.
- Oh, you liar.

381
00:19:13,604 --> 00:19:16,236
- How you doing, honey?
- Oh, fabulous.

382
00:19:16,394 --> 00:19:17,726
Just fabulous.

383
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,399
- Hey, Liz.
- Hey.

384
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,792
Hey, Liz.

385
00:19:23,015 --> 00:19:23,669
Bleeding?

386
00:19:24,207 --> 00:19:24,981
It's clean.

387
00:19:25,255 --> 00:19:26,840
All right. Way to go, team.

388
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,479
Good job, everybody. Thank you.

389
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:31,468
I don't think we made it worse.

390
00:19:32,235 --> 00:19:34,489
The big question is the optic nerve.

391
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,302
We'll know in the morning.

392
00:19:36,854 --> 00:19:38,319
Should I order the M.R.I.?

393
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:39,998
He needs to stabilize.

394
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,237
We'll do it tomorrow.

395
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,497
Is it over?

396
00:19:47,578 --> 00:19:50,304
- Hey, is it over?
- Yeah, it's over.

397
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:01,829
Hey, does Burke have a whipple scheduled?

398
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,881
Dr. Burke, I wanted to know if
you've seen nurse Fallon's labs.

399
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:08,706
I have.

400
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:09,801
They're getting worse.

401
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,655
The stent doesn't seem to be helping her jaundice.

402
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:12,453
No.

403
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,585
Should we be doing something?

404
00:20:13,662 --> 00:20:14,359
We are.

405
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:16,284
Oh, I noticed you didn't have
the whipple on the board.

406
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:17,988
Do you want me to
schedule it for you?

407
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:23,866
I want to see the results of her biopsy
and have a look at her overnight labs.

408
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:24,741
Overnight?

409
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:26,201
You're on call, right?

410
00:20:26,898 --> 00:20:29,811
Um... sure, yeah.

411
00:20:29,954 --> 00:20:31,153
Well, good. Stick with her.

412
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,347
You're doing the surgery, right?
You're still doing the whipple?

413
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,517
The woman has pancreatic cancer, Dr. Yang.

414
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:38,561
We're gonna do something.

415
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:39,472
Okay.

416
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:41,777
Okay.

417
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:44,434
Kiss the baby for me.

418
00:20:44,633 --> 00:20:46,498
- Well, get some sleep, Liz.
- Okay.

419
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:48,837
- Good night.
- See you later, hon.

420
00:20:49,734 --> 00:20:50,745
Bye-bye, Liz.

421
00:20:51,412 --> 00:20:52,861
Bye-bye. Take care.

422
00:20:58,086 --> 00:20:59,986
Your mum was a big woman.

423
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:01,455
You were her scrub nurse.

424
00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:03,405
Liz Fallon. Come in.

425
00:21:05,126 --> 00:21:06,278
Meredith Grey.

426
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:09,131
She wanted me to send her regards.

427
00:21:09,242 --> 00:21:10,476
That doesn't sound like her.

428
00:21:10,815 --> 00:21:11,751
Excuse me?

429
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:14,051
Well, the Ellis Grey I know

430
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:18,095
didn't have regards for anyone except Ellis Grey.

431
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,583
But you know that already, don't you?

432
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:21,777
Where is she now?

433
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,776
Traveling.

434
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,692
- Traveling?
- Yeah.

435
00:21:30,215 --> 00:21:31,560
Is she practicing?

436
00:21:32,046 --> 00:21:33,230
Not so much.

437
00:21:33,685 --> 00:21:40,059
Oh. Doesn't sound like her, either.
She was all work, just like me.

438
00:21:40,126 --> 00:21:41,438
She never left the hospital.

439
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:44,049
But you know that, too, don't you?

440
00:21:46,163 --> 00:21:47,038
Is she well?

441
00:21:47,652 --> 00:21:48,441
She's fine.

442
00:21:50,025 --> 00:21:50,787
Good.

443
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,771
Just wanted to send her regards.

444
00:21:54,293 --> 00:21:55,486
- Take care.
- Yeah.

445
00:22:05,508 --> 00:22:07,970
I think these were taken at the old house.

446
00:22:09,717 --> 00:22:11,775
There's you in your scrubs.

447
00:22:15,379 --> 00:22:16,269
Who is that?

448
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:17,759
That's dad.

449
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,113
Who?

450
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,577
Your husband.

451
00:22:21,736 --> 00:22:22,843
Thatcher Grey.

452
00:22:23,898 --> 00:22:25,342
You called him Thatch.

453
00:22:26,604 --> 00:22:27,395
Thatch.

454
00:22:28,746 --> 00:22:31,198
That's the red wagon he got me for my birthday.

455
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:35,443
I'm about 4 years old in this photo.

456
00:22:36,428 --> 00:22:37,829
This is your family.

457
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:40,952
Sure, sure.

458
00:22:48,027 --> 00:22:50,322
I saw Liz Fallon at the hospital today.

459
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:51,813
Liz.

460
00:22:52,411 --> 00:22:53,593
I love her.

461
00:22:53,992 --> 00:22:55,528
How is she?

462
00:22:56,477 --> 00:22:58,561
Is she still a scrub nurse?

463
00:22:59,317 --> 00:23:00,517
She was excellent.

464
00:23:10,609 --> 00:23:12,285
I reminded you before you went.

465
00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:13,524
I forgot when I got there.

466
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:14,572
No, no.

467
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:16,616
You are so passive-aggressive.

468
00:23:16,698 --> 00:23:17,302
Naked.

469
00:23:17,405 --> 00:23:18,818
I am naked in the shower.

470
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,793
They're just tampons, George.

471
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,412
I really needed tampons.

472
00:23:23,057 --> 00:23:23,830
God!

473
00:23:24,715 --> 00:23:26,277
I'm not riding in the same car with him.

474
00:23:26,425 --> 00:23:28,525
Unless you're going like that,
you're not riding with me.

475
00:23:28,581 --> 00:23:29,519
Where are the tampons?

476
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,374
He didn't buy them.

477
00:23:30,532 --> 00:23:31,755
You didn't buy them?

478
00:23:32,197 --> 00:23:33,998
Men don't buy tampons.

479
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,399
You are gonna have to get
over the man thing, George.

480
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,816
We're women! We have vaginas!

481
00:23:38,898 --> 00:23:39,856
Get used to it.

482
00:23:42,302 --> 00:23:43,850
I am not your sister!

483
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,204
Grilled cheese again?

484
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:51,565
Cold pizza.

485
00:23:53,253 --> 00:23:53,941
Is he awake?

486
00:23:54,193 --> 00:23:55,043
Even better.

487
00:23:55,744 --> 00:23:56,419
Really?

488
00:23:56,732 --> 00:23:58,068
Let's see what his nurse says.

489
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,184
Hi, Sona, Jorge. How are you this morning?

490
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:04,688
Tell them what color my dress is, Jorge.

491
00:24:05,456 --> 00:24:08,253
I'd know the answer to that
even if I couldn't see.

492
00:24:17,607 --> 00:24:19,403
I'm taking the elevator. You take the stairs.

493
00:24:19,951 --> 00:24:21,558
- I was going to, anyway.
- Good.

494
00:24:22,368 --> 00:24:23,090
Hold it.

495
00:24:24,573 --> 00:24:25,342
Thank you.

496
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:31,323
What?

497
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:43,994
You don't wake a patient like that.

498
00:24:44,337 --> 00:24:46,512
What do I have to do to get through to you?

499
00:24:46,716 --> 00:24:50,487
Cut me some slack. I was on call last night.
I didn't get much sleep.

500
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:51,977
Oh, stop whining.

501
00:24:52,648 --> 00:24:55,157
You'd rather be here, and you know it.

502
00:24:56,104 --> 00:24:59,170
What you got waiting for you at home - boyfriend?

503
00:25:00,347 --> 00:25:00,946
No.

504
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:03,287
A girlfriend?

505
00:25:03,988 --> 00:25:04,612
No.

506
00:25:05,257 --> 00:25:07,567
A pet? Family?

507
00:25:10,818 --> 00:25:11,667
A bed.

508
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:14,550
We got plenty of beds here.

509
00:25:15,262 --> 00:25:17,422
I don't feel sorry for you.

510
00:25:17,597 --> 00:25:20,300
This is who we are. This is our lives.

511
00:25:21,791 --> 00:25:23,741
You tell her, Dr. Burke.

512
00:25:32,276 --> 00:25:33,234
Can I talk to you?

513
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,553
Hey, come on, come on, come on!

514
00:25:36,085 --> 00:25:37,777
- Let's go.
- What's going on?

515
00:25:39,995 --> 00:25:41,481
Excuse me. What's going on?

516
00:25:42,932 --> 00:25:44,493
George, stop.

517
00:25:53,806 --> 00:25:57,165
We have Bethany Whisper in our locker room.

518
00:25:57,503 --> 00:26:02,136
Oh, boy, I guess they do airbrush
out the tattoo, don't they?

519
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:11,465
You want to see it?

520
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,615
You really want to see it?

521
00:26:14,514 --> 00:26:15,259
Fine.

522
00:26:15,556 --> 00:26:18,428
Let's look at that tattoo up
close and personal, shall we?!

523
00:26:18,654 --> 00:26:21,445
And what are these? Oh, my god! Breasts!

524
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:24,578
How does anybody practice medicine
hauling these things around?!

525
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,958
And what do we got back here?

526
00:26:27,025 --> 00:26:28,806
Let's see if I remember my anatomy.

527
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:32,212
Glutes, right?

528
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,281
Let's study them, shall we?

529
00:26:34,346 --> 00:26:37,920
Gather around and check out the booty that
put Izzie Stevens through med school.

530
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:41,679
Have you had enough or should I continue?

531
00:26:41,741 --> 00:26:44,582
Because I have a few more
very interesting tattoos.

532
00:26:47,756 --> 00:26:49,363
You want to call me Dr. Model?

533
00:26:50,634 --> 00:26:51,764
That's fine.

534
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:55,727
Just remember that while you're sitting
on 200 grand of student loans...

535
00:26:56,845 --> 00:26:58,150
I'm out of debt.

536
00:27:01,729 --> 00:27:02,528
I'll take them down.

537
00:27:02,605 --> 00:27:03,475
Don't bother.

538
00:27:05,963 --> 00:27:06,582
Go!

539
00:27:11,803 --> 00:27:13,781
Can you tell me what you had
for breakfast on monday?

540
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:15,337
Cheese omelet...

541
00:27:16,532 --> 00:27:17,780
and on sunday...

542
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:20,217
and on saturday...

543
00:27:21,196 --> 00:27:22,485
and on friday.

544
00:27:23,658 --> 00:27:27,262
Sona gets up every morning and
makes me a cheese omelet.

545
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,408
It's the only thing he likes.

546
00:27:29,591 --> 00:27:31,543
It's the only thing you know how to cook.

547
00:27:32,747 --> 00:27:33,775
Okay, well, things look good.

548
00:27:33,831 --> 00:27:37,289
But I need Jorge to get an M.R.I. this
morning to check for residual bleeding.

549
00:27:37,845 --> 00:27:38,743
Okay?

550
00:27:49,597 --> 00:27:53,016
This is who I was. It has nothing
to do with who I am now.

551
00:27:53,232 --> 00:27:55,172
I'm a physician, a surgeon.

552
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:59,535
And I am just as qualified as
any other intern on this floor.

553
00:27:59,862 --> 00:28:02,269
So you're just gonna have to
get over your chauvinist crap

554
00:28:02,371 --> 00:28:04,250
and allow me to do my job.

555
00:28:08,123 --> 00:28:10,384
I'm sure you're a very good doctor.

556
00:28:11,463 --> 00:28:13,119
Then what is your problem?

557
00:28:14,383 --> 00:28:15,171
Look...

558
00:28:18,023 --> 00:28:20,220
I fantasized about you,

559
00:28:21,894 --> 00:28:24,407
about the woman in this photo, whoever she is.

560
00:28:26,174 --> 00:28:27,499
I'm not proud of it,

561
00:28:28,094 --> 00:28:29,140
but it's a fact.

562
00:28:36,076 --> 00:28:37,683
Do you know what they're gonna do to me today?

563
00:28:40,623 --> 00:28:41,847
I have cancer.

564
00:28:43,106 --> 00:28:45,922
And they're gonna lift up my
legs and expose me to the world

565
00:28:45,994 --> 00:28:49,040
and cut out my prostate and my nerves -

566
00:28:50,403 --> 00:28:51,902
effectively neuter me.

567
00:28:55,394 --> 00:28:57,151
So is it so hard to understand

568
00:28:57,544 --> 00:29:01,277
that I don't want the woman who's
in that photo to witness...

569
00:29:04,374 --> 00:29:05,936
my emasculation?

570
00:29:14,303 --> 00:29:15,706
Have you seen her overnight labs?

571
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:16,642
I have.

572
00:29:16,745 --> 00:29:17,926
Did you check her liver panel?

573
00:29:18,067 --> 00:29:19,469
- They're not good.
- No, they suck.

574
00:29:19,566 --> 00:29:21,460
She's choking on bile. She's jaundiced.

575
00:29:21,557 --> 00:29:22,735
A very sick woman.

576
00:29:23,186 --> 00:29:24,702
Why haven't you scheduled the whipple?

577
00:29:25,689 --> 00:29:27,201
Well, are you a surgeon now?

578
00:29:27,297 --> 00:29:30,236
I'm her cruise director,
pushing her around all day.

579
00:29:30,318 --> 00:29:32,534
The woman is circling the drain.
We need to do something.

580
00:29:34,297 --> 00:29:36,658
- I'll take a look at her biopsy.
- Screw the biopsy.

581
00:29:36,744 --> 00:29:38,049
- Dr. Yang -
- Enough.

582
00:29:38,136 --> 00:29:40,451
You know - you know, I-I - you know what I think?

583
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,145
I think you never intended to do the whipple.

584
00:29:42,243 --> 00:29:44,389
I think this entire thing has been bull,

585
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,623
and you're behaving like the only reason
she's in this hospital is to die.

586
00:30:10,405 --> 00:30:11,991
There. That's a tumor.

587
00:30:12,943 --> 00:30:14,684
It's midline near the hypothalamus.

588
00:30:18,687 --> 00:30:19,404
Damn.

589
00:30:28,597 --> 00:30:32,944
Best practice, probably to remove the tumor,
"probably" because I can't get it all -

590
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,590
99% but not all of it.

591
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:40,528
Radiation and chemo, you're looking
at maybe 5 to 10 good years.

592
00:30:43,855 --> 00:30:44,834
Let's do it.

593
00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:48,101
You haven't heard the downside.

594
00:30:48,234 --> 00:30:50,920
See, the tumor is located in a part of your brain

595
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,518
where your memory and your personality resides.

596
00:30:54,076 --> 00:30:56,706
And because of the fuzzy
edges of this type of tumor,

597
00:30:57,383 --> 00:30:58,821
I have to cut out a lot.

598
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:03,046
Jorge, you stand a good chance
of losing your memories,

599
00:31:03,409 --> 00:31:06,333
of losing who you are.

600
00:31:06,876 --> 00:31:08,243
Is there any other way?

601
00:31:08,463 --> 00:31:11,720
The alternative is a gamma or cyberknife
treatment with focus radiation.

602
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,868
It's less evasive. There's
little chance of memory loss

603
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:19,164
or him losing himself, but it would only
give Jorge maybe three to five years.

604
00:31:19,287 --> 00:31:20,676
Three to five years?

605
00:31:25,825 --> 00:31:28,052
This is an incredibly difficult decision.

606
00:31:29,453 --> 00:31:33,065
If you have any more questions or you
need to talk to me, I'm here, okay?

607
00:31:52,014 --> 00:31:52,771
Hey.

608
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:55,040
I told my mother about you.

609
00:31:55,726 --> 00:31:57,585
She remembers you very well.

610
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,990
Of course she would.

611
00:32:01,216 --> 00:32:05,233
Ellis Grey never forgot a thing.

612
00:32:18,935 --> 00:32:19,831
I'm sorry.

613
00:32:20,195 --> 00:32:21,904
It's not really funny.

614
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,861
It's not funny, but...

615
00:32:24,372 --> 00:32:25,873
What's her diagnosis?

616
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:29,979
Alzheimer's...

617
00:32:31,327 --> 00:32:32,479
Early onset.

618
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,806
And she doesn't want anyone to know.

619
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,692
No.

620
00:32:40,757 --> 00:32:42,553
She's in a nursing home, and...

621
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:46,353
I'm the only person she'll allow to see her.

622
00:32:48,971 --> 00:32:54,980
But if I know Ellis Grey, she made the
nursing home sign a contract to that effect.

623
00:32:55,804 --> 00:32:57,464
You know my mother well.

624
00:32:58,887 --> 00:33:00,151
What a bitch.

625
00:33:06,087 --> 00:33:07,985
The woman's life was this hospital.

626
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:11,042
It was her home. It's a
sweet thing for them to do.

627
00:33:11,144 --> 00:33:13,489
It's a waste of a bed, and
it's a waste of my time.

628
00:33:13,643 --> 00:33:14,850
Who are we talking about?

629
00:33:15,404 --> 00:33:17,554
Miss Fallon. They brought her here to die.

630
00:33:17,953 --> 00:33:20,084
Wouldn't you want them to
do the same thing for you?

631
00:33:20,171 --> 00:33:22,701
No, I'd want the doctors to
do everything they could.

632
00:33:22,756 --> 00:33:24,836
I want them to cut me open until the minute I die.

633
00:33:24,943 --> 00:33:27,867
Sometimes doing everything can
be worse than doing nothing.

634
00:33:31,061 --> 00:33:32,567
You are 8 feet tall.

635
00:33:32,868 --> 00:33:34,563
Your boobs are perfect.

636
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:36,115
Your hair is down to there.

637
00:33:37,185 --> 00:33:40,370
If I were you, I would walk
around naked all the time.

638
00:33:40,861 --> 00:33:43,145
I wouldn't - I wouldn't have a job.

639
00:33:43,226 --> 00:33:45,229
I wouldn't have skills. I
wouldn't even know how to read.

640
00:33:45,316 --> 00:33:46,319
I'd just be...

641
00:33:47,174 --> 00:33:48,034
naked.

642
00:33:49,473 --> 00:33:50,585
It's makeup.

643
00:33:50,958 --> 00:33:52,099
It's retouching.

644
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:54,070
You get that we hate you, right?

645
00:33:57,425 --> 00:33:58,423
Bailey again.

646
00:33:59,728 --> 00:34:03,344
You know what? Any patient who spanks to
his doctor's pictures forfeits his rights.

647
00:34:03,426 --> 00:34:05,627
You're seriously not gonna give
up the prostatectomy, are you?

648
00:34:06,983 --> 00:34:07,767
Izzie?

649
00:34:09,809 --> 00:34:10,690
Oh, forget it.

650
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:15,089
You know, sometimes it is actually,
you know, painful to be around you.

651
00:34:20,302 --> 00:34:21,586
Where the hell have you been?

652
00:34:21,802 --> 00:34:24,888
When I page, you answer. It's not
that difficult to understand.

653
00:34:24,991 --> 00:34:27,715
O'Malley answered his page. He's doing your prep.

654
00:34:36,225 --> 00:34:38,339
If I hear the words Bethany
Whisper one more time -

655
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,085
I can't, okay?

656
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:42,696
I just... can't.

657
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:44,340
He doesn't want me in there.

658
00:34:44,438 --> 00:34:46,746
No, what he wants is to not have cancer.

659
00:34:46,822 --> 00:34:48,947
What he wants is to be saved.

660
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:51,579
You want to stay in the scrub
room, that's your choice.

661
00:34:55,043 --> 00:34:57,436
All right. I'll do my best.

662
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:02,373
Jorge and Sona want the surgery.

663
00:35:03,094 --> 00:35:04,487
They want you to cut it out?

664
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:06,473
It's their decision.

665
00:35:23,302 --> 00:35:25,719
They were never gonna operate.

666
00:35:25,822 --> 00:35:26,928
You could have told me.

667
00:35:28,342 --> 00:35:30,430
What fun would that have been?

668
00:35:32,509 --> 00:35:35,518
Think of it as a hazing ritual.

669
00:35:37,957 --> 00:35:39,225
Welcome...

670
00:35:40,046 --> 00:35:41,561
Liz, don't talk. Don't talk.

671
00:35:50,701 --> 00:35:54,382
Liz? Liz, stay... Liz, stay with me.

672
00:35:56,282 --> 00:35:57,268
Stay with me, Liz.

673
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,146
Sona?

674
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:37,243
Let's go.

675
00:36:37,473 --> 00:36:38,523
Right - right down.

676
00:36:39,334 --> 00:36:40,392
Pick up the bagger.

677
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:42,547
Push epi and atropine. You got it.

678
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:43,478
Somebody page Burke.

679
00:36:44,242 --> 00:36:45,870
- I'll start ventilation.
- Start that line.

680
00:36:47,042 --> 00:36:48,000
She's DNR.

681
00:36:48,212 --> 00:36:51,000
- One, two -
- She's DNR. Do not resuscitate!

682
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,737
- Dr. Yang!
- Come on, people!

683
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:54,134
Push another epi! Come on!

684
00:36:54,415 --> 00:36:56,499
You need to consider what you'll lose.

685
00:36:56,689 --> 00:37:00,401
What good is five years if he
doesn't joke about your omelets

686
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,813
and he can't remember seeing
you in that red dress?

687
00:37:02,895 --> 00:37:04,332
It's still five more years.

688
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,582
You don't understand.

689
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,198
He'll be there, but he won't be Jorge.

690
00:37:08,296 --> 00:37:10,820
- He won't even recognize you.
- This is our business.

691
00:37:11,357 --> 00:37:13,650
You have no idea what this will do to you.

692
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:17,415
Isn't 5 good years better than 10 bad ones?

693
00:37:17,584 --> 00:37:18,950
Meredith, what the hell are you doing?

694
00:37:19,074 --> 00:37:20,390
She needs to understand.

695
00:37:20,466 --> 00:37:21,788
I do understand.

696
00:37:22,581 --> 00:37:25,874
You think that I'm being selfish,
that I don't want to give him up.

697
00:37:26,023 --> 00:37:28,249
- I don't.
- This is Jorge's decision.

698
00:37:28,598 --> 00:37:31,004
And if that means 10 bad years for me, fine.

699
00:37:31,085 --> 00:37:34,138
I'll give him those years because I
will give him whatever he wants.

700
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:36,210
Look, I am so sorry, Sona.
Just please forgive her.

701
00:37:36,324 --> 00:37:40,921
And if he doesn't remember me, if
he doesn't remember what we are,

702
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,415
he's still my Jorge.

703
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,133
And I'll remember for us both.

704
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:47,578
Okay, all right.

705
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:54,418
Five, three, one, two.

706
00:37:54,517 --> 00:37:56,010
- What the hell are you two doing?
- We lost pulse.

707
00:37:56,327 --> 00:37:57,142
Let her go.

708
00:37:57,377 --> 00:37:59,011
- Where's that epi?
- Let her go!

709
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:00,711
She's DNR. Let her go down.

710
00:38:01,002 --> 00:38:03,336
...Four, five. One, two...

711
00:38:03,966 --> 00:38:05,547
- Do not resuscitate.
- All right.

712
00:38:05,629 --> 00:38:07,202
- It is on her chart.
- All right!

713
00:38:07,294 --> 00:38:08,349
Let her go down.

714
00:38:08,806 --> 00:38:10,397
Let her go down.

715
00:38:28,942 --> 00:38:30,043
Where are they?

716
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:33,571
He's resecting the prostate,
coming up on the distal nerve.

717
00:38:35,485 --> 00:38:36,325
You said...

718
00:38:37,323 --> 00:38:39,029
"I am not your sister."

719
00:38:40,857 --> 00:38:42,484
Do you feel like I was emasculating you?

720
00:38:42,536 --> 00:38:44,220
No. No.

721
00:38:44,753 --> 00:38:47,271
I'm too masculine to be emasculated.

722
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,241
I'm sorry.

723
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,257
Guess you put Dr. Model to rest.

724
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:01,292
I guess I did.

725
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:04,976
Dr. Victor, I'm sorry. But
these are viable nerves.

726
00:39:04,989 --> 00:39:06,867
We should save them.

727
00:39:06,968 --> 00:39:08,680
It'll take at least an hour longer,

728
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:11,305
and we might not get it all.

729
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:13,630
You know, they call him Limp Harry.

730
00:39:16,801 --> 00:39:19,758
But his prognosis with chemo is nearly as good.

731
00:39:19,852 --> 00:39:23,855
And, frankly, if you're worried about missing
your tea time, I'd be more than happy to finish.

732
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:24,919
Dr. Stevens.

733
00:39:25,498 --> 00:39:26,604
Can we help you?

734
00:39:26,701 --> 00:39:27,991
I'm sorry, Dr. Bailey.

735
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,747
Dr. Victor, I agree with her.

736
00:39:30,015 --> 00:39:31,167
You just can't -

737
00:39:32,825 --> 00:39:34,468
You have to save the nerves.

738
00:39:34,837 --> 00:39:36,383
- What?
- The nerves - you have to save them.

739
00:39:36,445 --> 00:39:37,526
Dr. Stevens, I can handle this.

740
00:39:37,622 --> 00:39:39,952
No, you told me the most important thing
is giving the patient what they want.

741
00:39:40,013 --> 00:39:41,884
What Humphrey wants is his erection.

742
00:39:42,496 --> 00:39:43,516
She's yours.

743
00:39:43,854 --> 00:39:44,966
You get her out.

744
00:39:45,114 --> 00:39:46,265
Can't do that, sir.

745
00:39:46,383 --> 00:39:48,641
You know how these young puppies are.

746
00:39:49,844 --> 00:39:52,230
I'm going to tell Richard about both of you.

747
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:56,587
You do that. In the meantime, let's pretend
it's you on this table and give this a try.

748
00:40:32,407 --> 00:40:33,565
You ever called one?

749
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:39,805
No.

750
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:43,650
Call it, doctor.

751
00:40:46,491 --> 00:40:48,321
Time of death, 11:43.

752
00:40:59,879 --> 00:41:02,961
I wish there were a rule book for intimacy.

753
00:41:06,873 --> 00:41:11,022
Some kind of a guide that could tell
you when you've crossed the line.

754
00:41:18,421 --> 00:41:19,798
You can't lose it like that.

755
00:41:21,118 --> 00:41:23,490
It would be nice if you could see it coming.

756
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,416
I'll get her.

757
00:41:26,906 --> 00:41:27,831
Let her go.

758
00:41:28,457 --> 00:41:30,530
And I don't know how you fit it on a map.

759
00:41:31,057 --> 00:41:32,569
We have to let her go.

760
00:41:43,536 --> 00:41:48,874
Of course, now you know every time he
gets a rise, he'll be thinking of you.

761
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:51,686
You take it where you can get it...

762
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:57,823
and keep it as long as you can.

763
00:42:09,488 --> 00:42:10,910
And as for rules...

764
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:15,422
Better not be using my toothbrush.

765
00:42:16,121 --> 00:42:16,887
I'm not.

766
00:42:18,251 --> 00:42:19,610
Maybe there are none.

767
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:33,951
Maybe the rules of intimacy are something
you have to define for yourself.
