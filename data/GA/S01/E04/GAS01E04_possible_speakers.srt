00:01:57,313 --> 00:02:03,762

51
00:02:17,056 --> 00:02:18,918

72
00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:53,627

77
00:02:58,735 --> 00:03:00,019

80
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:02,883

84
00:03:08,491 --> 00:03:09,675

85
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:11,617
Intern 2 / Jorge Cruz (PVM): I think there's an attending getting to know one of his interns.

86
00:03:11,717 --> 00:03:12,781
Intern 1 / Jorge Cruz OR Jorge Cruz (PVM): He slept with the intern.

87
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,301
Intern 2 / Jorge Cruz OR Jorge Cruz (PVM): He's barely newer.

88
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:14,764
Meredith Grey / Jorge Cruz OR Jorge Cruz (PVM): And it should stay that way.

89
00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:15,627
Derek Shepherd / Jorge Cruz OR Jorge Cruz (PVM): You want me to be professional?

90
00:03:16,288 --> 00:03:16,990
Meredith Grey / Jorge Cruz (PVM): I'll be professional.

91
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:17,912

92
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:18,794

93
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:20,417

94
00:03:22,461 --> 00:03:23,864

95
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:30,075
Cristina Yang / Hospital PA System (PVM): Anyone seen the floor chart on the new admission?

96
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,442
Elizabeth Fallon / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): You always come in like that, bang the light on?

97
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:38,525
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): You're Elizabeth Fallon?

98
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:40,646
Elizabeth Fallon: What does my chart say?

99
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:42,908
Cristina Yang / Elizabeth Fallon OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): It says you used to be a nurse here.

100
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:44,811
Elizabeth Fallon: A scrub nurse.

101
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:48,435
Cristina Yang / Elizabeth Fallon OR Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): And that you have abdominal mass consistent with pancreatic cancer?

102
00:03:48,454 --> 00:03:52,018
Elizabeth Fallon: Oh, and you are hoping they're going to give me a whipple.

103
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,822
Cristina Yang / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Pancreatic duodectomy.

104
00:03:56,723 --> 00:04:02,627
Elizabeth Fallon: This hospital sees those one, maybe, once every six months.

105
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:05,270
Elizabeth Fallon: That's why you got here at 4.30, huh?

106
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:06,192
Cristina Yang / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): 4.

107
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,735
Elizabeth Fallon: Grab my chart for anybody else could see it.

108
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:17,807
Elizabeth Fallon: Press Dr. Burke with your pre-round exam so you'd be the logical intern for him to ask to scrub in.

109
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:21,471
Elizabeth Fallon: I know all the tricks, Doctor.

110
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:22,733
Dr. Cristina Yang: Yang.

111
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:24,995

117
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:40,127

00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:41,528

119
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,673

120
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:44,935
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): If you could sit up for one moment.

121
00:04:51,745 --> 00:04:53,148
Elizabeth Fallon / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Thanks.

122
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,173
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): This might be a little bit cold, so just take a deep breath.

123
00:04:56,814 --> 00:04:57,995
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): If you could just take a deep breath.

124
00:04:58,211 --> 00:04:59,112
Elizabeth Fallon / Mr. Franklin OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): You're not a doctor.

125
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,235
Dr. Izzie Stevens: I'm Dr. Stevens, but you can call me Izzy.

126
00:05:01,295 --> 00:05:03,038
Dr. Izzie Stevens: I'll be helping Dr. Bailey with your biopsy this morning.

127
00:05:03,059 --> 00:05:04,040
Mr. Humphrey / Mr. Franklin OR Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): No, I don't think so, no.

128
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,423
Dr. Izzie Stevens: Mr. Humphrey, this will just take a moment.

129
00:05:06,603 --> 00:05:08,867
Mr. Humphrey: Give me Dr. Bailey or Dr. Victor.

130
00:05:09,187 --> 00:05:10,209
Dr. Izzie Stevens: I just need to do a briefing.

131
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:11,430
Mr. Humphrey: You don't need to do anything.

132
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:12,951
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Is this you?

133
00:05:15,137 --> 00:05:15,257
Mr. Humphrey: Huh?

134
00:05:16,278 --> 00:05:16,639
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Is this you?

135
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:19,682
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): It is, isn't it?

136
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:21,526
Mr. Humphrey: You know, get out of my room.

137
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:22,165
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Mr. Humphrey.

138
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:22,987
Mr. Humphrey: Get out of my room.

139
00:05:29,514 --> 00:05:30,836
George O'Malley / Dr. Burke (PVM): There need to be some rules.

140
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:31,838
Cristina Yang / Jorge Cruz (PVM): So what?

141
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:34,862
Cristina Yang / Jorge Cruz (PVM): We can walk around in our underwear on alternate Tuesdays?

142
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:37,625
Izzie Stevens / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Or you could see bras but not panties?

143
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:40,108
Cristina Yang / Jorge Cruz OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Or are you talking Amish rules?

144
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:44,473
George O'Malley / Jorge Cruz OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Because if you think you're going to get Izzy to cover herself from neck to ankle... The amount of flesh exposed is not the point.

145
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,475
George O'Malley / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): You have to do something.

295
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,947

296
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:13,750

308
00:12:50,548 --> 00:12:55,993

309
00:12:56,013 --> 00:12:57,855

310
00:12:57,913 --> 00:12:59,897

311
00:13:00,255 --> 00:13:01,817
George O'Malley / Hospital PA System OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): It was probably just crazy or something.

312
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:04,904

313
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:07,586

316
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:11,777
Unknown / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): What?

317
00:13:12,437 --> 00:13:16,163
Unknown / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Bethany Whisperer did a new Bethany Whisperer lingerie ad.

318
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:17,105

319
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:18,907

320
00:13:18,927 --> 00:13:19,749
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): No, the shoot was last year.

321
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:20,450
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Hospital PA System OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): It just came out.

322
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,413
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Hospital PA System OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): So because he saw you in a thong.

323
00:13:22,432 --> 00:13:23,594
Izzie Stevens / Hospital PA System OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): No, it wasn't a thong.

324
00:13:23,614 --> 00:13:24,836
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Hospital PA System OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Now you're hiding out in the hallway.

325
00:13:25,157 --> 00:13:27,360

326
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:28,880

327
00:13:28,922 --> 00:13:29,923

329

330
00:13:32,086 --> 00:13:33,028

331
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:36,413
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Hospital PA System (PVM): If they come back positive, I expect to see you in surgery.

332
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,480
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Hospital PA System (PVM): Hey, you on this, you understand me?

333
00:13:40,522 --> 00:13:51,740
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Jorge Cruz OR Hospital PA System OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Vertiginous or lightheadedness?

334
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,782
Mr. Humphrey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Lightheaded.

335
00:13:52,822 --> 00:13:55,144
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Sometimes he'd have to brace himself to get out of bed.

336
00:13:55,264 --> 00:13:56,148
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Could be a million things.

337
00:13:56,488 --> 00:13:57,450
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Simple orthostasis.

338
00:13:58,331 --> 00:13:58,772

339
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,081

Izzie Stevens / Jorge Cruz (PVM): He said he tripped.

341
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,509
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Just because you hear hoofbeats, don't assume zebras.

342
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:07,452
Izzie Stevens / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Something caused him to lose consciousness and fall down the stairs.

343
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:08,855
Izzie Stevens / Jorge Cruz (PVM): He could have a tumor.

344
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:12,864
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Look, I have no idea why this guy is still alive, let alone moving and talking.

345
00:14:13,806 --> 00:14:14,365
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Not a clue.

346
00:14:15,226 --> 00:14:17,993
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Jorge Cruz OR Dr. Burke (PVM): Let's just get him through this before we start digging around for something else.

347
00:14:19,947 --> 00:14:22,129
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Shepard.

348
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:22,649
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Jorge Cruz (PVM): 23 cases?

349
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,392
Team Member (Possibly a Surgeon or Resident) / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): One was attempted suicide.

350
00:14:24,552 --> 00:14:25,231
Team Member (Possibly Lead Surgeon) / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Yeah, that doesn't count.

351
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:26,033
Lead Surgeon / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Talk to me about procedure.

352
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:30,096
Resident or Fellow / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Biggest problems were bleeding and infection, but the odds improved to shorter surgery times.

353
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:32,980
Resident or Fellow / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Bottom line was, get them out quickly and watch for bleeding.

354
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:34,363
Lead Surgeon / Jorge Cruz OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): I got it.

355
00:14:34,383 --> 00:14:35,565
Resident / Jorge Cruz (PVM): In other words, I'm on my own.

356
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:44,975
Lead Surgeon / Dr. Burke (PVM): You coming?

357
00:14:46,154 --> 00:14:49,200
Resident / Dr. Burke (PVM): Dude, I don't need an escort.

358
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:49,379
Lead Surgeon / Dr. Burke (PVM): Go.

359
00:14:50,894 --> 00:14:51,297
Lead Surgeon / Dr. Burke (PVM): Go ahead.

360
00:14:54,546 --> 00:14:56,028

361
00:14:58,657 --> 00:15:00,302

362
00:15:00,743 --> 00:15:03,048
Dr. Bethany / Dr. Burke OR Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): That's so nice.

363
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:23,485
Jorge Cruz / Ray (PVM): She had this thing, red, when we met.

364
00:15:25,088 --> 00:15:28,211
Jorge Cruz / Ray (PVM): Red car, red dresses, red hats.

365
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:30,495
Jorge Cruz / Ray (PVM): Personally, I hated the color.

366
00:15:31,657 --> 00:15:33,298
Jorge Cruz / Ray (PVM): Too obvious, you know?

367
00:15:33,317 --> 00:15:37,963
Jorge Cruz / Ray (PVM): But a couple of years ago, I took her up to the mountains.

368
00:15:39,725 --> 00:15:40,865
Jorge Cruz / Ray (PVM): And she was in her red dress.

369
00:15:41,868 --> 00:15:47,192
Jorge Cruz / Jorge Cruz OR Ray (PVM): And there was this field of red poppies, I think.

370
00:15:47,984 --> 00:15:56,735
Jorge Cruz / Jorge Cruz (PVM): And she jumped out of the car and ran into them and started laughing, laughing at all of the red.

371
00:15:59,638 --> 00:16:08,408
Lead Surgeon / Dr. Burke OR Hospital PA System OR Hospital PA System (PVM): The good news is it hasn't spread from his prostate to his lymph nodes.

372
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:11,312
Lead Surgeon / Dr. Burke (PVM): With a radical prostatectomy, we could probably get it all.

373
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:13,475
Lead Surgeon / Dr. Burke OR Hospital PA System (PVM): Good prognosis.

374
00:16:13,495 --> 00:16:16,118
Resident or Fellow / Hospital PA System (PVM): Spare some nerves, give him a chance at a normal sex life?

375
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:19,442
Lead Surgeon / Dr. Burke (PVM): Young puppies like to take chances with cancer.

376
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:23,067
Lead Surgeon / Dr. Burke OR Jorge Cruz (PVM): Old dogs like me, we do what works.

377
00:16:23,086 --> 00:16:24,528
Resident or Fellow / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Yes, sir, of course.

378
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:25,590
Resident or Surgical Intern (possibly George O'Malley or Alex Karev) / Jorge Cruz (PVM): We on the schedule tomorrow?

379
00:16:25,928 --> 00:16:26,571
Another Resident or Surgical Intern (possibly Alex Karev or George O'Malley) / Hospital PA System (PVM): Uh, 10 AM.

380
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,091
First Resident/Intern (possibly George O'Malley or Alex Karev) / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Good.

381
00:16:27,431 --> 00:16:29,113
First Resident/Intern (possibly George O'Malley) / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Maybe I can squeeze in a round.

382
00:16:30,432 --> 00:16:32,296
Alex Karev / Hospital PA System (PVM): An ass who deals in asses.

383
00:16:33,697 --> 00:16:34,898
Alex Karev / Hospital PA System (PVM): We call him Limp Harry.

384
00:16:35,418 --> 00:16:36,817
Alex Karev / Hospital PA System (PVM): He never spares the nerves.

385
00:16:41,682 --> 00:16:46,628
Dr. Shepherd / Jorge Cruz OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): As you can see, the patient has shot seven nails directly into the skull.

386
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:51,759
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): without doing significant damage other than the optic nerve.

387
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,903
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): And we may be able to save that.

388
00:16:55,384 --> 00:16:59,393
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): The idea is to remove the nails at exactly the angle they entered.

389
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:05,240
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Any wiggle and we risk doing more damage than when they went in.

390
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:06,884
Intern or Nurse / Dr. Burke OR Dr. Burke OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Where are they?

391

392
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:09,730

393
00:17:10,537 --> 00:17:12,097
Intern (possibly George O'Malley or Alex Karev) / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Hey, I heard you got a whipple.

394
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:13,019
Another Intern / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Yeah, maybe a whipple.

395
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,442
Another Intern / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Burke has rung my butt off.

396
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:16,482
Another Intern / Elizabeth Fallon OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Oh, man, look at those films.

397
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:19,208

398
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,613

399
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:27,038

400
00:17:27,116 --> 00:17:31,702
Another Intern / Hospital PA System OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): There goes the third grade.

401
00:17:31,722 --> 00:17:35,326

402
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:40,054
Attending or Senior Resident (possibly Dr. Bailey) / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Burke OR Jorge Cruz (PVM): Fisher's sailing for their mission.

403
00:17:41,838 --> 00:17:42,843
Attending or Senior Resident (possibly Dr. Bailey) / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Burke (PVM): Did you put in the blood work?

404
00:17:43,805 --> 00:17:45,048
Dr. Yang / Dr. Burke (PVM): Oh, right before I got here.

405
00:17:46,874 --> 00:17:48,396
Attending or Senior Resident (possibly Dr. Bailey) / Dr. Burke (PVM): Take her to radiology for the MRI.

406
00:17:48,478 --> 00:17:49,200
Attending or Senior Resident (possibly Dr. Bailey) / Dr. Burke (PVM): Beat me when you're done.

407
00:17:53,951 --> 00:17:54,815

408
00:17:57,863 --> 00:17:58,144

409
00:18:03,387 --> 00:18:05,471
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Here.

410
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:06,973
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): I'm actually out of the grocery money.

411
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:09,278
George O'Malley / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): When are you going?

412
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:15,490
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Burke OR Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Okay, seriously, George, please don't... Yeah, can we not talk about it here?

413
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:16,092
Cristina Yang / Dr. Burke OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): What, tampons?

414
00:18:17,452 --> 00:18:18,736
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Burke OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Did you not hear a word I said?

415
00:18:18,776 --> 00:18:22,962

416
00:18:24,707 --> 00:18:27,049

417
00:18:34,134 --> 00:18:38,065
Meredith Grey / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): I always divided surgeons into two categories.

418
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:42,315
Meredith Grey / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Those that remember the name of their patients and those who didn't.

419
00:18:42,957 --> 00:18:45,461
Meredith Grey / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): They all remember their surgeries, of course.

420
00:18:45,903 --> 00:18:47,586
Meredith Grey / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Every damn suture.

421
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:50,319
Meredith Grey / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): But the good ones remember their names, right?

422
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:51,520
Izzie Stevens / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): I didn't say that.

423
00:18:51,602 --> 00:18:56,445
Meredith Grey / Elizabeth Fallon OR Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Now, some of the best ones, you know, distance themselves on purpose.

424
00:18:56,906 --> 00:19:02,153
Meredith Grey / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): They believe that the personal stuff clouds the medicine.

425
00:19:02,594 --> 00:19:03,493

426
00:19:03,515 --> 00:19:04,894

Meredith Grey / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): I didn't get much sleep.

576
00:24:50,534 --> 00:24:51,755
Ellis Grey / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Oh, stop whining.

577
00:24:52,817 --> 00:24:54,778
Ellis Grey / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): You'd rather be here and you know it.

578
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,780
Ellis Grey / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): What you got waiting for you at home?

579
00:24:58,442 --> 00:24:59,022
Ellis Grey / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Boyfriend?

580
00:25:00,525 --> 00:25:00,743
Meredith Grey / Dr. Burke (PVM): No.

581
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:03,248
Liz Fallon / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): A girlfriend?

582
00:25:04,147 --> 00:25:04,410
Meredith Grey / Dr. Burke (PVM): No.

583
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:06,009
Liz Fallon / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): A pet?

584
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,393
Liz Fallon / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Family?

585
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,339
Meredith Grey / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): A bed.

586
00:25:12,682 --> 00:25:14,287
Liz Fallon / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): You got plenty of beds here.

587
00:25:15,568 --> 00:25:17,073
Liz Fallon / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): I don't feel sorry for you.

588
00:25:17,712 --> 00:25:19,017
Liz Fallon / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): This is who we are.

589
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:20,179
Liz Fallon / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): This is our lives.

590
00:25:21,942 --> 00:25:23,526
Liz Fallon / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): You tell her, Dr. Burke.

591
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,520
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Excuse me.

592
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,065
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): What's going on?

593
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:51,134
Meredith Grey / Elizabeth Fallon OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): George, stop.

594
00:25:54,258 --> 00:25:56,799
Cristina Yang / Jorge Cruz OR Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): We have Bethany Whisperer in our locker room.

595
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,403
George O'Malley / Dr. Burke (PVM): Oh, boy.

596
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:02,185
Cristina Yang / Dr. Burke (PVM): I guess they do airbrush out the tattoo, don't they?

597
00:26:10,451 --> 00:26:11,133
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): You want to see it?

598
00:26:12,413 --> 00:26:13,434
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): You really want to see it?

599
00:26:14,817 --> 00:26:15,076
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Fine.

600
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,201
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Let's look at that tattoo up close and personal, shall we?

601
00:26:18,761 --> 00:26:19,481
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): And what are these?

602
00:26:19,722 --> 00:26:20,625
Meredith Grey / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Oh, my God.

603
00:26:20,785 --> 00:26:21,546
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Breasts.

604
00:26:21,566 --> 00:26:24,450
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): How does anybody practice medicine hauling these things around?

605
00:26:25,872 --> 00:26:26,932
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): And what have we got back here?

606
00:26:26,971 --> 00:26:28,713
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Let's see if I remember my anatomy.

607
00:26:30,718 --> 00:26:31,999
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Glutes, right?

608
00:26:32,538 --> 00:26:34,342
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Let's study them, shall we?

609
00:26:34,362 --> 00:26:38,145
Alex Karev / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Gather around and check out the booty that put Izzy Stevens through med school.

610
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:44,257
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Have you had enough or should I continue because I have a few more very interesting tattoos?

611
00:26:47,824 --> 00:26:49,105
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): You want to call me Dr. Model?

612
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:51,490
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): That's fine.

613
00:26:52,471 --> 00:26:57,741
Dr. Izzie Stevens: Just remember that while you're sitting on 200 grand of student loans, I'm out of debt.

614
00:27:02,471 --> 00:27:02,852
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Burke (PVM): I'll take her down.

615
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:13,595
Doctor (likely Meredith Grey or Cristina Yang) / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Can you tell me what you had for breakfast on Monday?

616
00:27:14,576 --> 00:27:15,195
Jorge Cruz: Cheese omelet.

617
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:17,598
Doctor (likely Meredith Grey or Cristina Yang) / Jorge Cruz (PVM): And on Sunday.

618
00:27:19,122 --> 00:27:19,942
Doctor (likely Meredith Grey or Cristina Yang) / Jorge Cruz (PVM): And on Saturday.

619
00:27:21,423 --> 00:27:22,286
Doctor (likely Meredith Grey or Cristina Yang) / Jorge Cruz (PVM): And on Friday.

620
00:27:23,866 --> 00:27:27,393
Jorge Cruz: Sona gets up every morning and makes me a cheese omelet.

621
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:29,015
Sona Cruz: It's the only thing he likes.

622
00:27:29,654 --> 00:27:31,258
Jorge (patient) / Jorge Cruz (PVM): It's the only thing you know how to cook.

623
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:37,085
Doctor (likely Meredith Grey or Cristina Yang) / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Okay, well, things look good, but I need Jorge to get an MRI this morning to check for residual bleeding.

624
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:38,625
Sona (Jorge's partner) / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Okay?

625
00:27:49,913 --> 00:27:50,732
Dr. Izzie Stevens: This is who I was.

626
00:27:51,213 --> 00:27:52,616
Dr. Izzie Stevens: It has nothing to do with who I am now.

627
00:27:53,459 --> 00:27:59,190
Dr. Izzie Stevens: I'm a physician, a surgeon, and I am just as qualified as any other intern on this floor.

628
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:03,836
Dr. Izzie Stevens: So you're just going to have to get over your chauvinist crap and allow me to do my job.

629
00:28:08,664 --> 00:28:10,048
Alex Karev / Mr. Franklin (PVM): I'm sure you're a very good doctor.

630
00:28:11,632 --> 00:28:12,932
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Then what is your problem?

631
00:28:18,112 --> 00:28:19,752
Alex Karev / Mr. Franklin (PVM): I fantasized about you.

632
00:28:22,037 --> 00:28:23,979
Alex Karev / Mr. Franklin (PVM): About the woman in this photo, whoever she is.

633
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:28,924
Alex Karev / Mr. Franklin (PVM): I'm not proud of it, but it's a fact.

634
00:28:36,095 --> 00:28:37,276
Mr. Franklin: Do you know what they're gonna do to me today?

635
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:41,622
Mr. Franklin: I have cancer.

636
00:28:43,203 --> 00:28:51,550
Mr. Franklin: and they're gonna lift up my legs and expose me to the world and cut out my prostate and my nerves and effectively neuter me.

637
00:28:55,536 --> 00:29:11,490
Alex Karev / Mr. Franklin (PVM): So is it so hard to understand that I don't want the woman who's in that photo to witness... my emasculation?

638
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:15,409
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Have you seen her overnight labs?

639
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:16,351
Izzie Stevens / Elizabeth Fallon OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): I have.

640
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:17,672
Cristina Yang / Elizabeth Fallon OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Did you check her liver panel?

641
00:29:18,093 --> 00:29:18,692
Izzie Stevens / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): They're not good.

642
00:29:18,712 --> 00:29:19,615
Cristina Yang / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): No, they suck.

643
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:20,776
George O'Malley / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): She's choking on bile.

644
00:29:20,796 --> 00:29:21,497
Meredith Grey / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): She's jaundiced.

645
00:29:21,557 --> 00:29:23,318
Alex Karev / Elizabeth Fallon OR Dr. Burke (PVM): A very sick woman.

646
00:29:23,338 --> 00:29:24,461
Cristina Yang / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Why haven't you scheduled the Whipple?

647
00:29:26,123 --> 00:29:27,022
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Burke (PVM): Are you her surgeon now?

648
00:29:27,384 --> 00:29:30,188
Izzie Stevens / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): I'm her cruise director pushing her around all day.

649
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,430
Cristina Yang / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): The woman is circling the drain.

650
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,391
Meredith Grey / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): We need to do something.

651
00:29:34,394 --> 00:29:35,755
Dr. Burke / Dr. Burke (PVM): I'll take a look at her biopsies.

652
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:36,777
Cristina Yang / Elizabeth Fallon OR Dr. Burke (PVM): What are the biopsies?

653
00:29:36,797 --> 00:29:38,137
Dr. Burke / Elizabeth Fallon OR Dr. Burke (PVM): You know, enough.

654
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,298
Dr. Bailey / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): You know, I...

655
00:29:39,886 --> 00:29:40,390
Dr. Bailey / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): You know what I think?

656
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,096
Dr. Bailey / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): I think you never intended to do the Whipple.

657
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:47,755
Dr. Bailey / Elizabeth Fallon OR Dr. Burke (PVM): I think this entire thing has been bull, and you're behaving like the only reason she's in this hospital is to die.

658
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,810
Dr. Burke / Jorge Cruz (PVM): There.

659
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:11,791
Dr. Burke / Jorge Cruz (PVM): It's a tumor.

660
00:30:13,193 --> 00:30:14,454
Dr. Burke / Hospital PA System (PVM): Midline of the hypothalamus.

661
00:30:28,692 --> 00:30:28,790
Cristina Yang / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Damn.

662
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:29,491
Dr. Bailey / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Best practice?

663
00:30:29,992 --> 00:30:31,193
Dr. Burke / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Probably to remove the tumor.

664
00:30:31,615 --> 00:30:33,057
Dr. Burke / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Probably because I can't get it all.

665
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:37,701
Doctor (likely Derek Shepherd or another neurosurgeon) / Jorge Cruz (PVM): 99%, but not all of it.

666
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:40,403
Doctor (likely Derek Shepherd or another neurosurgeon) / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Radiation and chemo, you're looking at maybe five to ten good years.

667
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:47,780
Doctor (likely Derek Shepherd or another neurosurgeon) / Jorge Cruz (PVM): You haven't heard the downside.

668
00:30:48,363 --> 00:30:53,291
Doctor (likely Derek Shepherd or another neurosurgeon) / Jorge Cruz (PVM): See, the tumor is located in the part of your brain where your memory and your personality resides.

669
00:30:54,335 --> 00:30:58,682
Doctor (likely Derek Shepherd or another neurosurgeon) / Jorge Cruz (PVM): And because of the fuzzy edges of this type of tumor, I have to cut out a lot.

670
00:30:59,663 --> 00:31:06,038
Doctor (likely Derek Shepherd or another neurosurgeon) / Jorge Cruz (PVM): All right, you stand a good chance of losing your memories, of losing who you are.

671
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,280
Patient or Patient's Family Member / Hospital PA System (PVM): Is there any other way?

672
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,635
Doctor (likely Derek Shepherd or another neurosurgeon) / Jorge Cruz (PVM): The alternative is a gamma or cyber knife treatment with focused radiation.

673
00:31:11,717 --> 00:31:18,708
Doctor (likely Derek Shepherd or another neurosurgeon) / Jorge Cruz (PVM): It's less evasive, this little chance of memory loss or him losing himself, but it would only give Jorge maybe three to five years.

674
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,269
Patient or Patient's Family Member / Hospital PA System (PVM): Three to five years?

675
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,823
Doctor (likely Derek Shepherd or another neurosurgeon) / Mr. Franklin (PVM): This is an incredibly difficult decision.

676
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:54,954
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Jorge Cruz (PVM): I told my mother about you.

677
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:57,239
Meredith Grey / Jorge Cruz (PVM): She remembers you very well.

678
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,820
Richard Webber / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Of course she would.

679
00:31:59,882 --> 00:32:04,866
Richard Webber / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Ellis Gray never forgot a thing.

680
00:32:14,637 --> 00:32:16,221
Meredith Grey / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Oh!

681
00:32:18,277 --> 00:32:19,699
Richard Webber / Dr. Burke (PVM): I'm sorry.

682
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:22,423
Richard Webber / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): It's not really funny.

683
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:25,727
Meredith Grey / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): It's not funny, but... What's her diagnosis?

684
00:32:29,171 --> 00:32:29,750
Richard Webber / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Alzheimer's.

685
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:36,621
Richard Webber / Jorge Cruz OR Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Early onset.

686
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:38,442
Meredith Grey / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): And she doesn't want anyone to know?

687
00:32:39,265 --> 00:32:39,463
Richard Webber / Dr. Burke (PVM): No.

688
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:46,173
Richard Webber / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): She's in a nursing home, and I'm the only person she'll allow to see her.

689
00:32:49,088 --> 00:32:54,698
Richard Webber / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): But if I know Ellis Gray, she made the nursing home sign a contract to that effect.

690
00:32:56,038 --> 00:32:57,141
Meredith Grey / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): You know my mother well.

691
00:32:59,163 --> 00:32:59,845
Meredith Grey / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): What a bitch.

692
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,836
Richard Webber / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): The woman's life was this hospital.

693
00:33:08,297 --> 00:33:09,057
Unknown / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): It was her home.

694
00:33:09,198 --> 00:33:10,861
Unknown / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): It's a sweet thing for them to do.

695
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,384
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): It's a waste of a bed and it's a waste of my time.

696
00:33:13,805 --> 00:33:15,267
Meredith Grey / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Who are we talking about?

697
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:16,314
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Miss Fallon.

698
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,434
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): They brought her here to die.

699
00:33:18,175 --> 00:33:20,117
Meredith Grey / Elizabeth Fallon OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Wouldn't you want them to do the same thing for you?

700
00:33:20,137 --> 00:33:20,200
Cristina Yang / Dr. Burke (PVM): No.

701
00:33:20,338 --> 00:33:21,039
Cristina Yang / Dr. Burke (PVM): You know what?

702
00:33:21,181 --> 00:33:22,863
Cristina Yang / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): I'd want the doctors to do everything they could.

703
00:33:22,903 --> 00:33:24,786
Cristina Yang / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): I'd want them to cut me open until the minute I die.

704
00:33:25,144 --> 00:33:27,608
Meredith Grey / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Sometimes doing everything can be worse than doing nothing.

705
00:33:31,213 --> 00:33:32,336
Cristina Yang / Dr. Burke (PVM): You are eight feet tall.

706
00:33:33,076 --> 00:33:34,480
Cristina Yang / Dr. Burke (PVM): Your boobs are perfect.

707
00:33:34,778 --> 00:33:36,000
Cristina Yang / Dr. Burke (PVM): Your hair is down to there.

708
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:40,528
Cristina Yang / Dr. Burke (PVM): If I were you, I would walk around naked all the time.

709
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,213
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Burke (PVM): I wouldn't have a job.

710
00:33:43,233 --> 00:33:44,017
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): I wouldn't have skills.

711
00:33:44,076 --> 00:33:45,136
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): I wouldn't even know how to read.

712
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:47,740
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): I'd just be naked.

713
00:33:49,703 --> 00:33:50,404
Izzie Stevens / Hospital PA System OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): It's makeup.

714
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:51,969
Izzie Stevens / Hospital PA System (PVM): It's retouching.

715
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,832
Cristina Yang / Hospital PA System OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): You get that we hate you, right?

716
00:33:57,656 --> 00:33:58,298
Meredith Grey / Dr. Burke (PVM): Bailey again?

717
00:33:59,941 --> 00:34:00,342

742
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:25,396

766
00:36:56,869 --> 00:37:02,858
Sona / Jorge Cruz OR Jorge Cruz OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): What good is five years if he doesn't joke about your omelets and he can't remember seeing you in that red dress?

767
00:37:02,878 --> 00:37:04,280
Liz / Jorge Cruz OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): It's still five more years.

768
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,521

773
00:37:13,952 --> 00:37:17,014

775
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:20,378

00:37:26,304 --> 00:37:26,465
Zona / Hospital PA System (PVM): I don't.

779
00:37:26,485 --> 00:37:27,885
Zona / Hospital PA System (PVM): This is Jorge's decision.

780
00:37:28,867 --> 00:37:30,949
Zona / Hospital PA System (PVM): And if that means 10 bad years for me, fine.

781
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,811
Zona / Hospital PA System (PVM): I'll give him those years, because I will give him whatever he wants.

782
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,414
Jorge / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Look, I am so sorry, Zona.

783
00:37:35,434 --> 00:37:36,315

784
00:37:36,335 --> 00:37:36,755

785
00:37:36,775 --> 00:37:40,980

786
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:44,083
Zona / Hospital PA System (PVM): He's still my Horty.

787
00:37:44,103 --> 00:37:45,626

789
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,974

797
00:37:59,244 --> 00:37:59,905

802
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,972

803
00:38:07,233 --> 00:38:08,074

00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,302
Unknown (likely a surgical intern or resident) / Dr. Burke OR Dr. Burke OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Where are they?

806
00:38:30,322 --> 00:38:33,545
Unknown (likely a surgical nurse or resident) / Dr. Burke (PVM): He's resecting the prostate, coming up on the distal nerve.

807
00:38:35,568 --> 00:38:38,652
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): You said I am not your sister.

808
00:38:40,954 --> 00:38:42,496

809
00:38:42,516 --> 00:38:42,715
Alex Karev / Dr. Burke (PVM): No.

810
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:44,056

812

00:39:00,376 --> 00:39:01,137

815
00:39:02,568 --> 00:39:05,650
Izzie Stevens / Hospital PA System (PVM): Dr. Victor, I'm sorry, but these are viable nerves.

816
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,012
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Burke OR Hospital PA System (PVM): We should save them.

817
00:39:07,032 --> 00:39:10,934
Dr. Victor / Dr. Burke OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): It'll take at least an hour longer, and we might not get it all.

818
00:39:11,695 --> 00:39:13,297
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): I know they call him Limp Harry.

819
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:24,186
Izzie Stevens / Hospital PA System (PVM): But his prognosis with chemo is nearly as good, and frankly, if you're worried about missing your tea time, I'd be more than happy to finish.

820
00:39:24,226 --> 00:39:24,688
Dr. Victor / Hospital PA System (PVM): Dr. Stevens?

821

824
00:39:30,172 --> 00:39:30,853
Dr. Victor / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): You just can't...

825
00:39:31,862 --> 00:39:34,126
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Burke OR Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): You have to save the nerves.

826
00:39:34,967 --> 00:39:35,148

827
00:39:35,188 --> 00:39:35,608

828
00:39:35,628 --> 00:39:36,509

830
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:40,014
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Burke OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): No, you told me the most important thing is giving the patient what they want.

831
00:39:40,034 --> 00:39:41,597
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): What Humphrey wants is his erection.

832
00:39:42,657 --> 00:39:43,318
Dr. Victor / Dr. Burke (PVM): She's yours.

833
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,641
Older Authority Figure (e.g., attending doctor or supervisor) / Dr. Burke (PVM): You get her out.

834
00:39:45,101 --> 00:39:46,003
Younger Doctor (e.g., resident or intern) / Hospital PA System (PVM): Can't do that, sir.

835
00:39:46,483 --> 00:39:48,266
Older Authority Figure (e.g., attending doctor or supervisor) / Hospital PA System (PVM): You know how these young puppies are.

836
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:52,170
Older Authority Figure (e.g., Miranda Bailey) / Dr. Burke (PVM): I'm going to tell Richard about both of you.

837
00:39:52,311 --> 00:39:52,791
Younger Doctor (e.g., intern) / Hospital PA System (PVM): You do that.

838
00:39:53,032 --> 00:39:56,217
Older Authority Figure (e.g., Miranda Bailey) / Hospital PA System (PVM): In the meantime, let's pretend it's you on this table and give this a try.

839
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:20,637
Meredith Grey / Elizabeth Fallon OR Elizabeth Fallon OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Look me in the eye and tell me you don't find me attractive.

840
00:40:20,657 --> 00:40:23,922
Derek Shepherd / Elizabeth Fallon OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Look me in the heart and tell me you won't go.

841
00:40:25,503 --> 00:40:29,648
Meredith Grey / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Look me in the eye and promise no loves like I love.

842
00:40:30,108 --> 00:40:32,650
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Burke OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Look me in the heart and I'm very broken.

843
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,391

844
00:40:42,704 --> 00:40:59,827
Younger Doctor (e.g., intern) / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Time of death, 1143.

845
00:41:00,228 --> 00:41:02,492
Dr. Meredith Gray: I wish there were a rule book for intimacy.

846
00:41:03,012 --> 00:41:10,804
Dr. Meredith Gray: Some kind of a guide that could tell you when you've crossed the line.

847
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:23,320
Dr. Meredith Gray: It would be nice if you could see it coming.

848
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,085
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Jorge Cruz (PVM): I'll get it.

849
00:41:27,105 --> 00:41:28,487
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Meredith Gray OR Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Better go.

850
00:41:28,507 --> 00:41:30,429
Dr. Meredith Gray: But I don't know how you'd fit in on a map.

851
00:41:43,554 --> 00:41:44,436
Cristina Yang / Hospital PA System (PVM): Of course.

852
00:41:44,456 --> 00:41:48,380
Izzie Stevens / Hospital PA System (PVM): Now, you know every time he gets a rise, he'll be thinking of you.

853
00:41:49,902 --> 00:41:51,364
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You take it where you can get it.

854
00:41:55,228 --> 00:41:58,472
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Meredith Gray OR Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): And keep it as long as you can.

855
00:41:58,492 --> 00:42:10,947
Dr. Meredith Gray: And as for rules...
