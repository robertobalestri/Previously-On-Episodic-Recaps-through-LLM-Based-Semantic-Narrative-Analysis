51
00:02:17,056 --> 00:02:18,918

00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:48,317

71
00:02:51,783 --> 00:02:52,526

72
00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:53,627
Meredith Grey / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Mr. Humphrey (PVM): The cereal person?

73
00:02:54,187 --> 00:02:55,730
Cristina Yang / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Straight out of the box, you're all fruit and fribery.

74
00:02:57,114 --> 00:02:57,495
Meredith Grey / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Pancakes?

75
00:02:57,514 --> 00:02:58,235

76
00:02:58,354 --> 00:02:58,675

77
00:02:58,735 --> 00:03:00,019

81

82
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:07,349

83
00:03:07,632 --> 00:03:08,473
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Learn it, live it.

84
00:03:08,491 --> 00:03:09,675
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): It's unprofessional.

85
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:11,617
Meredith Grey / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Mr. Humphrey (PVM): I think there's an attending getting to know one of his interns.

86
00:03:11,717 --> 00:03:12,781
Cristina Yang / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Zona (PVM): He slept with the intern.

87
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,301

88
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:14,764

89
00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:15,627
Meredith Grey / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Mr. Humphrey OR Zona (PVM): You want me to be professional?

90
00:03:16,288 --> 00:03:16,990
Cristina Yang / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Mr. Humphrey (PVM): I'll be professional.

91
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:17,912

92
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:18,794
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): And that's what you get.

93
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:20,417
Cristina Yang / Zona (PVM): You're going to be late for your chordotomy.

94
00:03:22,461 --> 00:03:23,864

95
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:30,075
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Anyone seen the floor chart on the new admission?

96
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,442
Elizabeth Fallon: You always come in like that, bang the light on?

97
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:38,525
Dr. Cristina Yang: You're Elizabeth Fallon?

98
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:40,646
Elizabeth Fallon: What does my chart say?

99
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:42,908
Dr. Cristina Yang: It says you used to be a nurse here.

100
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:44,811
Elizabeth Fallon: A scrub nurse.

101
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:48,435
Dr. Cristina Yang: And that you have abdominal mass consistent with pancreatic cancer?

102
00:03:48,454 --> 00:03:52,018
Elizabeth Fallon: Oh, and you are hoping they're going to give me a whipple.

103
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,822
Dr. Cristina Yang: Pancreatic duodectomy.

104
00:03:56,723 --> 00:04:02,627
Elizabeth Fallon: This hospital sees those one, maybe, once every six months.

105
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:05,270
Elizabeth Fallon: That's why you got here at 4.30, huh?

106
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:06,192
Unknown / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): 4.

107
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,735
Cristina Yang / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Grab my chart for anybody else could see it.

108
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:17,807
Cristina Yang / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Press Dr. Burke with your pre-round exam so you'd be the logical intern for him to ask to scrub in.

109
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:21,471
Nurse Fallon / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): I know all the tricks, Doctor.

110
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:22,733
Nurse Fallon / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Yang.

111
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:24,995

116
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:37,683

117
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:40,127

118
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:41,528

119
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,673

120
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:44,935
Cristina Yang / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): If you could sit up for one moment.

121
00:04:51,745 --> 00:04:53,148
Mr. Humphrey: Thanks.

122
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,173
Cristina Yang / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): This might be a little bit cold, so just take a deep breath.

123
00:04:56,814 --> 00:04:57,995
Cristina Yang / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): If you could just take a deep breath.

124
00:04:58,211 --> 00:04:59,112
Mr. Humphrey: You're not a doctor.

125
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,235
Dr. Isobel Stevens: I'm Dr. Stevens, but you can call me Izzy.

126
00:05:01,295 --> 00:05:03,038
Dr. Isobel Stevens: I'll be helping Dr. Bailey with your biopsy this morning.

127
00:05:03,059 --> 00:05:04,040
Mr. Humphrey: No, I don't think so, no.

128
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,423
Dr. Isobel Stevens: Mr. Humphrey, this will just take a moment.

129
00:05:06,603 --> 00:05:08,867
Mr. Humphrey: Give me Dr. Bailey or Dr. Victor.

130
00:05:09,187 --> 00:05:10,209
Dr. Isobel Stevens: I just need to do a briefing.

131
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:11,430
Mr. Humphrey: You don't need to do anything.

132
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:12,951
Mr. Humphrey: Is this you?

133
00:05:15,137 --> 00:05:15,257
Dr. Isobel Stevens: Huh?

134
00:05:16,278 --> 00:05:16,639
Mr. Humphrey: Is this you?

135
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:19,682
Mr. Humphrey: It is, isn't it?

136
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:21,526
Mr. Humphrey: You know, get out of my room.

137
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:22,165
Dr. Isobel Stevens: Mr. Humphrey.

138
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:22,987
Mr. Humphrey: Get out of my room.

139
00:05:29,514 --> 00:05:30,836
Meredith Grey / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): There need to be some rules.

140
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:31,838
George O'Malley / Zona (PVM): So what?

141
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:34,862
George O'Malley / Zona (PVM): We can walk around in our underwear on alternate Tuesdays?

142
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:37,625
Alex Karev / Mr. Humphrey OR Zona (PVM): Or you could see bras but not panties?

143
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:40,108
Izzie Stevens / Mr. Humphrey OR Zona (PVM): Or are you talking Amish rules?

144
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:44,473
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey OR Zona OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Because if you think you're going to get Izzy to cover herself from neck to ankle... The amount of flesh exposed is not the point.

145
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,475
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): You have to do something.

146
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,137
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): It's your house.

147
00:05:47,516 --> 00:05:48,558
Dr. Meredith Grey: It's my mother's house.

148
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,379

149
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:51,973
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Do you like Izzy?

150
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:53,156
Meredith Grey / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Is that what this is about?

151
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:54,278
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Do you have a crush on Izzy?

152
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:55,180
Izzie Stevens / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Izzy?

153
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,483

297
00:12:14,613 --> 00:12:16,115

305

310
00:12:57,913 --> 00:12:59,897
Alex Karev / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Nothing.

311
00:13:00,255 --> 00:13:01,817
Alex Karev / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): It was probably just crazy or something.

312
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:04,904
Hospital Intercom: Dr. Campbell to oncology.

313
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:07,586

316
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:11,777
Cristina Yang / Dr. Isobel Stevens OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): What?

317
00:13:12,437 --> 00:13:16,163
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): Bethany Whisperer did a new Bethany Whisperer lingerie ad.

318
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:17,105
Cristina Yang / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): He saw it in a magazine.

319
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:18,907
Cristina Yang / Dr. Isobel Stevens OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You got time to pose for a magazine?

320
00:13:18,927 --> 00:13:19,749
Dr. Isobel Stevens: No, the shoot was last year.

321
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:20,450
Dr. Isobel Stevens: It just came out.

322
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,413
Cristina Yang / Dr. Isobel Stevens OR Dr. Isobel Stevens OR Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): So because he saw you in a thong.

00:13:22,432 --> 00:13:23,594

324
00:13:23,614 --> 00:13:24,836
Cristina Yang / Dr. Isobel Stevens OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Now you're hiding out in the hallway.

325
00:13:25,157 --> 00:13:27,360
Dr. Isobel Stevens: I just think it might be easier if you sign another interview.

326
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:28,880
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Easy is not in your job description.

327
00:13:28,922 --> 00:13:29,923

331
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:36,413
Dr. Preston Burke: If they come back positive, I expect to see you in surgery.

332
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,480
Dr. Preston Burke: Hey, you on this, you understand me?

333
00:13:40,522 --> 00:13:51,740
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Vertiginous or lightheadedness?

334
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,782
Patient: Lightheaded.

335
00:13:52,822 --> 00:13:55,144
Relative of Patient / Zona OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Sometimes he'd have to brace himself to get out of bed.

336
00:13:55,264 --> 00:13:56,148
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Could be a million things.

337
00:13:56,488 --> 00:13:57,450
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Simple orthostasis.

338
00:13:58,331 --> 00:13:58,772

339
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,081
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): What made him fall downstairs with a nail gun?

340
00:14:01,123 --> 00:14:02,024
Patient: He said he tripped.

341
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,509
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Just because you hear hoofbeats, don't assume zebras.

342
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:07,452
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Mr. Humphrey OR Zona (PVM): Something caused him to lose consciousness and fall down the stairs.

343
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:08,855

344
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:12,864
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Look, I have no idea why this guy is still alive, let alone moving and talking.

345
00:14:13,806 --> 00:14:14,365
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Not a clue.

346
00:14:15,226 --> 00:14:17,993
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Let's just get him through this before we start digging around for something else.

347
00:14:19,947 --> 00:14:22,129
Unknown / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Shepard.

348
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:22,649
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): 23 cases?

349
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,392
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): One was attempted suicide.

350
00:14:24,552 --> 00:14:25,231
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Yeah, that doesn't count.

351
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:26,033
Ellis Grey / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Talk to me about procedure.

352
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:30,096
Meredith Grey / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Biggest problems were bleeding and infection, but the odds improved to shorter surgery times.

353
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:32,980
Meredith Grey / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Bottom line was, get them out quickly and watch for bleeding.

354
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:34,363
Meredith Grey / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): I got it.

355
00:14:34,383 --> 00:14:35,565
Meredith Grey / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): In other words, I'm on my own.

356
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:44,975
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): You coming?

357
00:14:46,154 --> 00:14:49,200
Alex Karev / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Dude, I don't need an escort.

358
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:49,379

359
00:14:50,894 --> 00:14:51,297

360
00:14:54,546 --> 00:14:56,028
Dr. Richard Webber / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Well, well, well.

361
00:14:58,657 --> 00:15:00,302

362
00:15:00,743 --> 00:15:03,048
Meredith Grey / Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): That's so nice.

363
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:23,485
Patient's Husband / Jorge Cruz OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): She had this thing, red, when we met.

364
00:15:25,088 --> 00:15:28,211
Patient's Husband / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Red car, red dresses, red hats.

365
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:30,495
Patient's Husband / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Personally, I hated the color.

366
00:15:31,657 --> 00:15:33,298
Patient's Husband / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Too obvious, you know?

367
00:15:33,317 --> 00:15:37,963
Patient's Husband / Jorge Cruz OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): But a couple of years ago, I took her up to the mountains.

368
00:15:39,725 --> 00:15:40,865
Patient's Husband / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): And she was in her red dress.

369
00:15:41,868 --> 00:15:47,192
Patient's Husband / Jorge Cruz OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): And there was this field of red poppies, I think.

370
00:15:47,984 --> 00:15:56,735
Patient's Husband / Jorge Cruz OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): And she jumped out of the car and ran into them and started laughing, laughing at all of the red.

371
00:15:59,638 --> 00:16:08,408
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Isobel Stevens OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): The good news is it hasn't spread from his prostate to his lymph nodes.

372
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:11,312
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): With a radical prostatectomy, we could probably get it all.

373
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:13,475
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Isobel Stevens OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Good prognosis.

374
00:16:13,495 --> 00:16:16,118
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Spare some nerves, give him a chance at a normal sex life?

375
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:19,442
Older Male Patient / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): Young puppies like to take chances with cancer.

376
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:23,067
Older Male Patient / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): Old dogs like me, we do what works.

377
00:16:23,086 --> 00:16:24,528
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): Yes, sir, of course.

378
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:25,590
Older Male Patient / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): We on the schedule tomorrow?

379
00:16:25,928 --> 00:16:26,571
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Uh, 10 AM.

380
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,091
Older Male Patient / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): Good.

381
00:16:27,431 --> 00:16:29,113
Older Male Patient / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): Maybe I can squeeze in a round.

382
00:16:30,432 --> 00:16:32,296
Dr. Preston Burke / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): An ass who deals in asses.

383
00:16:33,697 --> 00:16:34,898
Dr. Preston Burke / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): We call him Limp Harry.

384
00:16:35,418 --> 00:16:36,817
Dr. Preston Burke / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): He never spares the nerves.

385
00:16:41,682 --> 00:16:46,628
Dr. Bailey / Jorge Cruz (PVM): As you can see, the patient has shot seven nails directly into the skull.

386
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:51,759
Dr. Bailey / Jorge Cruz (PVM): without doing significant damage other than the optic nerve.

387
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,903
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): And we may be able to save that.

388
00:16:55,384 --> 00:16:59,393
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): The idea is to remove the nails at exactly the angle they entered.

389
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:05,240
Dr. Bailey / Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Any wiggle and we risk doing more damage than when they went in.

390
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:06,884
George O'Malley / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Where are they?

391
00:17:07,164 --> 00:17:08,646
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Move over.

392
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:09,730
Izzie Stevens / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): They're just pulling them out.

393
00:17:10,537 --> 00:17:12,097
Alex Karev / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Hey, I heard you got a whipple.

394
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:13,019
George O'Malley / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Yeah, maybe a whipple.

395
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,442
George O'Malley / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Burke has rung my butt off.

396
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:16,482
Alex Karev / Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Oh, man, look at those films.

397
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:19,208
Cristina Yang / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): It's Hellraiser.

398
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,613
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Shell phone.

399
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:27,038
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): There you go.

400
00:17:27,116 --> 00:17:31,702
George O'Malley / Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): There goes the third grade.

401
00:17:31,722 --> 00:17:35,326

402
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:40,054
Unknown (off-screen or authority figure) / Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Fisher's sailing for their mission.

403
00:17:41,838 --> 00:17:42,843
Dr. Bailey / Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Did you put in the blood work?

404
00:17:43,805 --> 00:17:45,048
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Oh, right before I got here.

405
00:17:46,874 --> 00:17:48,396
Dr. Bailey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Take her to radiology for the MRI.

406
00:17:48,478 --> 00:17:49,200
Dr. Bailey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Beat me when you're done.

407
00:17:53,951 --> 00:17:54,815
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You want the Whipple, right?

408
00:17:57,863 --> 00:17:58,144
George O'Malley / Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Yeah.

409
00:18:03,387 --> 00:18:05,471
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Isobel Stevens OR Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): Here.

410
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:06,973
George O'Malley / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): I'm actually out of the grocery money.

411
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:09,278
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Isobel Stevens OR Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): When are you going?

412
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:15,490
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Isobel Stevens OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Okay, seriously, George, please don't... Yeah, can we not talk about it here?

413
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:16,092
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): What, tampons?

414
00:18:17,452 --> 00:18:18,736
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Did you not hear a word I said?

415
00:18:18,776 --> 00:18:22,962
Meredith Grey / Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): You're a man, we know.

416
00:18:24,707 --> 00:18:27,049
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Talk about shrinking the salamander.

417
00:18:34,134 --> 00:18:38,065
Dr. Meredith Grey: I always divided surgeons into two categories.

418
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:42,315
Dr. Meredith Grey: Those that remember the name of their patients and those who didn't.

419
00:18:42,957 --> 00:18:45,461
Meredith Grey / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): They all remember their surgeries, of course.

420
00:18:45,903 --> 00:18:47,586
Meredith Grey / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Every damn suture.

421
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:50,319
Cristina Yang / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): But the good ones remember their names, right?

422
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:51,520
Meredith Grey / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): I didn't say that.

423
00:18:51,602 --> 00:18:56,445
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Now, some of the best ones, you know, distance themselves on purpose.

424
00:18:56,906 --> 00:19:02,153
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): They believe that the personal stuff clouds the medicine.

425
00:19:02,594 --> 00:19:03,493
Izzie Stevens / Elizabeth Fallon OR Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Hi, Liz.

426
00:19:03,515 --> 00:19:04,894

428
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:09,299
Izzie Stevens / Elizabeth Fallon OR Elizabeth Fallon OR Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): I'm sure this baby can see you.

429
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,059
Alex Karev / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Hey, Liz.

430
00:19:10,142 --> 00:19:11,082
Liz / Dr. George O'Malley OR Elizabeth Fallon OR Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Hey.

431
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:11,942
Izzie Stevens / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): You're looking good.

432
00:19:12,064 --> 00:19:13,525
Liz / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Oh, you liar.

433

00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:06,009
Dr. Burke / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): A pet?

584
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,393
Dr. Burke / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Family?

585
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,339
Cristina Yang / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): A bed.

586
00:25:12,682 --> 00:25:14,287
Dr. Burke / Elizabeth Fallon OR Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): You got plenty of beds here.

587
00:25:15,568 --> 00:25:17,073
Dr. Burke / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): I don't feel sorry for you.

588
00:25:17,712 --> 00:25:19,017
Dr. Burke / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): This is who we are.

589
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:20,179
Sona / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): This is our lives.

590
00:25:21,942 --> 00:25:23,526
Jorge Cruz / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): You tell her, Dr. Burke.

591
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,520
George O'Malley / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Excuse me.

592
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,065
Izzie Stevens / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): What's going on?

593
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:51,134
Izzie Stevens / Elizabeth Fallon OR Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): George, stop.

594
00:25:54,258 --> 00:25:56,799
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): We have Bethany Whisperer in our locker room.

595
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,403
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Oh, boy.

596
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:02,185
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I guess they do airbrush out the tattoo, don't they?

597
00:26:10,451 --> 00:26:11,133
Dr. Isobel Stevens: You want to see it?

598
00:26:12,413 --> 00:26:13,434
Dr. Isobel Stevens: You really want to see it?

599
00:26:14,817 --> 00:26:15,076
Dr. Isobel Stevens: Fine.

600
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,201
Dr. Isobel Stevens: Let's look at that tattoo up close and personal, shall we?

601
00:26:18,761 --> 00:26:19,481
Dr. Isobel Stevens: And what are these?

602
00:26:19,722 --> 00:26:20,625
Cristina Yang / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): Oh, my God.

603
00:26:20,785 --> 00:26:21,546
Cristina Yang / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): Breasts.

604
00:26:21,566 --> 00:26:24,450
Cristina Yang / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): How does anybody practice medicine hauling these things around?

605
00:26:25,872 --> 00:26:26,932
Dr. Isobel Stevens: And what have we got back here?

606
00:26:26,971 --> 00:26:28,713
Dr. Isobel Stevens: Let's see if I remember my anatomy.

607
00:26:30,718 --> 00:26:31,999
Dr. Isobel Stevens: Glutes, right?

608
00:26:32,538 --> 00:26:34,342
Dr. Isobel Stevens: Let's study them, shall we?

609
00:26:34,362 --> 00:26:38,145
Dr. Isobel Stevens: Gather around and check out the booty that put Izzy Stevens through med school.

610
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:44,257
Dr. Isobel Stevens: Have you had enough or should I continue because I have a few more very interesting tattoos?

611
00:26:47,824 --> 00:26:49,105
Dr. Isobel Stevens: You want to call me Dr. Model?

612
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:51,490
Dr. Isobel Stevens: That's fine.

613
00:26:52,471 --> 00:26:57,741
Dr. Isobel Stevens: Just remember that while you're sitting on 200 grand of student loans, I'm out of debt.

614
00:27:02,471 --> 00:27:02,852
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): I'll take her down.

615
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:13,595
Dr. Burke / Jorge Cruz (PVM): Can you tell me what you had for breakfast on Monday?

616
00:27:14,576 --> 00:27:15,195
Jorge Cruz: Cheese omelet.

617
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:17,598
Dr. Burke / Jorge Cruz (PVM): And on Sunday.

618
00:27:19,122 --> 00:27:19,942
Dr. Burke / Jorge Cruz (PVM): And on Saturday.

619
00:27:21,423 --> 00:27:22,286
Dr. Burke / Jorge Cruz (PVM): And on Friday.

620
00:27:23,866 --> 00:27:27,393
Jorge Cruz: Sona gets up every morning and makes me a cheese omelet.

621
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:29,015
Sona: It's the only thing he likes.

622
00:27:29,654 --> 00:27:31,258
Jorge Cruz: It's the only thing you know how to cook.

623
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:37,085
Meredith Grey / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Okay, well, things look good, but I need Jorge to get an MRI this morning to check for residual bleeding.

624
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:38,625
Elizabeth Fallon / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): Okay?

625
00:27:49,913 --> 00:27:50,732
Elizabeth Fallon / Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): This is who I was.

626
00:27:51,213 --> 00:27:52,616
Elizabeth Fallon / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): It has nothing to do with who I am now.

627
00:27:53,459 --> 00:27:59,190
Elizabeth Fallon / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): I'm a physician, a surgeon, and I am just as qualified as any other intern on this floor.

628
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:03,836
Elizabeth Fallon / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): So you're just going to have to get over your chauvinist crap and allow me to do my job.

629
00:28:08,664 --> 00:28:10,048
Jorge (Patient) / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): I'm sure you're a very good doctor.

630
00:28:11,632 --> 00:28:12,932
Elizabeth Fallon / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): Then what is your problem?

631
00:28:18,112 --> 00:28:19,752
Jorge (Patient) / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): I fantasized about you.

632
00:28:22,037 --> 00:28:23,979
Jorge (Patient) / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): About the woman in this photo, whoever she is.

633
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:28,924
Jorge (Patient) / Dr. Alex Karev OR Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): I'm not proud of it, but it's a fact.

634
00:28:36,095 --> 00:28:37,276
Jorge (Patient) / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): Do you know what they're gonna do to me today?

635
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:41,622
Jorge (Patient) / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): I have cancer.

636
00:28:43,203 --> 00:28:51,550
Jorge (Patient) / Dr. Alex Karev OR Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): and they're gonna lift up my legs and expose me to the world and cut out my prostate and my nerves and effectively neuter me.

637
00:28:55,536 --> 00:29:11,490
Jorge (Patient) / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): So is it so hard to understand that I don't want the woman who's in that photo to witness... my emasculation?

638
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:15,409
Meredith Grey / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Have you seen her overnight labs?

639
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:16,351
Elizabeth Fallon / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): I have.

640
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:17,672
Meredith Grey / Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Did you check her liver panel?

641
00:29:18,093 --> 00:29:18,692
Elizabeth Fallon / Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): They're not good.

642
00:29:18,712 --> 00:29:19,615
Meredith Grey / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): No, they suck.

643
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:20,776
Elizabeth Fallon / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): She's choking on bile.

644
00:29:20,796 --> 00:29:21,497
Meredith Grey / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): She's jaundiced.

645
00:29:21,557 --> 00:29:23,318
Elizabeth Fallon / Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): A very sick woman.

646
00:29:23,338 --> 00:29:24,461
Meredith Grey / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Why haven't you scheduled the Whipple?

647
00:29:26,123 --> 00:29:27,022
Elizabeth Fallon / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Are you her surgeon now?

648
00:29:27,384 --> 00:29:30,188
Meredith Grey / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): I'm her cruise director pushing her around all day.

649
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,430
Elizabeth Fallon / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): The woman is circling the drain.

650
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,391
Meredith Grey / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): We need to do something.

651
00:29:34,394 --> 00:29:35,755
Elizabeth Fallon / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I'll take a look at her biopsies.

652
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:36,777
Meredith Grey / Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): What are the biopsies?

653
00:29:36,797 --> 00:29:38,137
Elizabeth Fallon / Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You know, enough.

654
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,298
Elizabeth Fallon / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): You know, I...

655
00:29:39,886 --> 00:29:40,390
Elizabeth Fallon / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): You know what I think?

656
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,096
Elizabeth Fallon / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): I think you never intended to do the Whipple.

657
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:47,755
Izzie Stevens / Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): I think this entire thing has been bull, and you're behaving like the only reason she's in this hospital is to die.

658
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,810
Cristina Yang / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): There.

659
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:11,791
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): It's a tumor.

660
00:30:13,193 --> 00:30:14,454
Cristina Yang / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Midline of the hypothalamus.

661
00:30:28,692 --> 00:30:28,790
Alex Karev / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Damn.

662
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:29,491
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Best practice?

663
00:30:29,992 --> 00:30:31,193
Meredith Grey / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Probably to remove the tumor.

664
00:30:31,615 --> 00:30:33,057
Meredith Grey / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Probably because I can't get it all.

665
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:37,701
Meredith Grey / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Mr. Humphrey (PVM): 99%, but not all of it.

666
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:40,403
Meredith Grey / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Radiation and chemo, you're looking at maybe five to ten good years.

667
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:47,780
Cristina Yang / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): You haven't heard the downside.

668
00:30:48,363 --> 00:30:53,291
Cristina Yang / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): See, the tumor is located in the part of your brain where your memory and your personality resides.

669
00:30:54,335 --> 00:30:58,682
Cristina Yang / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): And because of the fuzzy edges of this type of tumor, I have to cut out a lot.

670
00:30:59,663 --> 00:31:06,038
Cristina Yang / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): All right, you stand a good chance of losing your memories, of losing who you are.

671
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,280
Patient's Family Member / Zona (PVM): Is there any other way?

672
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,635
Cristina Yang / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Mr. Humphrey (PVM): The alternative is a gamma or cyber knife treatment with focused radiation.

673
00:31:11,717 --> 00:31:18,708
Cristina Yang / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Mr. Humphrey (PVM): It's less evasive, this little chance of memory loss or him losing himself, but it would only give Jorge maybe three to five years.

674
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,269
Patient's Family Member / Zona (PVM): Three to five years?

675
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,823
Meredith Grey / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): This is an incredibly difficult decision.

676
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:54,954
Richard Webber / Zona (PVM): I told my mother about you.

677
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:57,239
Richard Webber / Zona (PVM): She remembers you very well.

678
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,820
Meredith Grey / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Of course she would.

679
00:31:59,882 --> 00:32:04,866
Richard Webber / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Ellis Gray never forgot a thing.

680
00:32:14,637 --> 00:32:16,221
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Oh!

681
00:32:18,277 --> 00:32:19,699
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): I'm sorry.

682
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:22,423
Izzie Stevens / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): It's not really funny.

683
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:25,727
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey OR Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): It's not funny, but... What's her diagnosis?

684
00:32:29,171 --> 00:32:29,750
Meredith Grey / Zona (PVM): Alzheimer's.

685
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:36,621
Meredith Grey / Zona OR Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Early onset.

686
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:38,442
Cristina Yang / Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): And she doesn't want anyone to know?

687
00:32:39,265 --> 00:32:39,463
Meredith Grey / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): No.

688
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:46,173
Meredith Grey / Mr. Humphrey OR Zona OR Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): She's in a nursing home, and I'm the only person she'll allow to see her.

689
00:32:49,088 --> 00:32:54,698
Cristina Yang / Elizabeth Fallon OR Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): But if I know Ellis Gray, she made the nursing home sign a contract to that effect.

690
00:32:56,038 --> 00:32:57,141
Meredith Grey / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): You know my mother well.

691
00:32:59,163 --> 00:32:59,845
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey OR Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): What a bitch.

692
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,836
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Isobel Stevens (PVM): The woman's life was this hospital.

693
00:33:08,297 --> 00:33:09,057
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Isobel Stevens OR Mr. Humphrey (PVM): It was her home.

694
00:33:09,198 --> 00:33:10,861
George O'Malley / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): It's a sweet thing for them to do.

695
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,384
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): It's a waste of a bed and it's a waste of my time.

696
00:33:13,805 --> 00:33:15,267
Izzie Stevens / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Who are we talking about?

697
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:16,314
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Miss Fallon.

698
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,434
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): They brought her here to die.

699
00:33:18,175 --> 00:33:20,117
Izzie Stevens / Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Wouldn't you want them to do the same thing for you?

700
00:33:20,137 --> 00:33:20,200
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): No.

701
00:33:20,338 --> 00:33:21,039
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): You know what?

702
00:33:21,181 --> 00:33:22,863
Cristina Yang / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): I'd want the doctors to do everything they could.

703
00:33:22,903 --> 00:33:24,786
Cristina Yang / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): I'd want them to cut me open until the minute I die.

704
00:33:25,144 --> 00:33:27,608
Izzie Stevens / Zona (PVM): Sometimes doing everything can be worse than doing nothing.

705
00:33:31,213 --> 00:33:32,336
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey OR Mr. Humphrey (PVM): You are eight feet tall.

706
00:33:33,076 --> 00:33:34,480
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Your boobs are perfect.

707
00:33:34,778 --> 00:33:36,000
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Your hair is down to there.

708
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:40,528
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): If I were you, I would walk around naked all the time.

709
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,213
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): I wouldn't have a job.

710
00:33:43,233 --> 00:33:44,017
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): I wouldn't have skills.

711
00:33:44,076 --> 00:33:45,136
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): I wouldn't even know how to read.

712
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:47,740
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): I'd just be naked.

713
00:33:49,703 --> 00:33:50,404
Izzie Stevens / Mr. Humphrey OR Zona (PVM): It's makeup.

714
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:51,969
Izzie Stevens / Zona (PVM): It's retouching.

715
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,832
Cristina Yang / Zona (PVM): You get that we hate you, right?

716
00:33:57,656 --> 00:33:58,298
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Bailey again?

717
00:33:59,941 --> 00:34:00,342
Izzie Stevens / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): You know what?

718
00:34:00,422 --> 00:34:03,246
Izzie Stevens / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Any patient who spanks his doctor's pictures forfeits his rights.

719
00:34:03,586 --> 00:34:05,568
Cristina Yang / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): You're seriously not going to give up the prostatectomy, are you?

720
00:34:07,291 --> 00:34:07,613
Meredith Grey / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Izzy.

721
00:34:11,373 --> 00:34:14,735
Cristina Yang / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): You know, sometimes it's actually, you know, painful to be around you.

722
00:34:14,775 --> 00:34:21,402
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Where the hell have you been?

723
00:34:22,023 --> 00:34:23,264
Dr. Miranda Bailey: When I page, you answer.

724
00:34:23,304 --> 00:34:24,766
Dr. Miranda Bailey: It's not that difficult to understand.

725
00:34:25,126 --> 00:34:26,487
Nurse / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): O'Malley answered his page.

Izzie Stevens / Zona OR Mr. Humphrey (PVM): She's an intern.

785
00:37:36,775 --> 00:37:40,980

786
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:44,083
Zona: He's still my Horty.

787
00:37:44,103 --> 00:37:45,626

817
00:39:07,032 --> 00:39:10,934

825
00:39:31,862 --> 00:39:34,126

826
00:39:34,967 --> 00:39:35,148

831

834
00:39:45,101 --> 00:39:46,003

835
00:39:46,483 --> 00:39:48,266

836
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:52,170

837
00:39:52,311 --> 00:39:52,791

838
00:39:53,032 --> 00:39:56,217
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): In the meantime, let's pretend it's you on this table and give this a try.

839
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:20,637
Meredith Grey / Mr. Humphrey OR Elizabeth Fallon (PVM): Look me in the eye and tell me you don't find me attractive.

840
00:40:20,657 --> 00:40:23,922
Meredith Grey / Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Look me in the heart and tell me you won't go.

841
00:40:25,503 --> 00:40:29,648

842
00:40:30,108 --> 00:40:32,650
Meredith Grey / Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Look me in the heart and I'm very broken.

843
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,391

844
00:40:42,704 --> 00:40:59,827
Izzie Stevens / Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Time of death, 1143.

845
00:41:00,228 --> 00:41:02,492
Dr. Meredith Grey: I wish there were a rule book for intimacy.

846
00:41:03,012 --> 00:41:10,804
Dr. Meredith Grey: Some kind of a guide that could tell you when you've crossed the line.

847
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:23,320
Dr. Meredith Grey: It would be nice if you could see it coming.

848
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,085
Izzie Stevens / Zona OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I'll get it.

849
00:41:27,105 --> 00:41:28,487
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Better go.

850
00:41:28,507 --> 00:41:30,429
Dr. Meredith Grey: But I don't know how you'd fit in on a map.

851
00:41:43,554 --> 00:41:44,436
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Of course.

852
00:41:44,456 --> 00:41:48,380
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Now, you know every time he gets a rise, he'll be thinking of you.

853
00:41:49,902 --> 00:41:51,364
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): You take it where you can get it.

854
00:41:55,228 --> 00:41:58,472
Miranda Bailey / Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): And keep it as long as you can.

855
00:41:58,492 --> 00:42:10,947
Dr. Meredith Grey: And as for rules...

856
00:42:13,811 --> 00:42:15,193
Dr. Meredith Grey: Better not be using my toothbrush.

857
00:42:16,476 --> 00:42:18,318
Izzie Stevens / Mr. Humphrey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I'm not.

858
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:28,195
Dr. Meredith Grey: Maybe there are none.

859
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:33,643
Dr. Meredith Grey: Maybe the rules of intimacy are something you have to define for yourself.

860
00:42:48,034 --> 00:42:49,135
Izzie Stevens / Mr. Humphrey (PVM): Good night.
