Suddenly, Fallon\u2019s condition deteriorates. Cristina and the team rush in and attempt to resuscitate her, but Dr. Bailey reminds them that Fallon is DNR. Cristina is forced to stop CPR, and Fallon dies as the team stands by, respecting her wishes.",

As Dr. Victor prepares to proceed quickly, Izzie speaks up, reminding the team that Mr. Humphrey specifically requested a nerve-sparing procedure to preserve his sexual function, even though it will make the surgery more complex and time-consuming. Dr. Victor is dismissive, arguing that the patient\u2019s age makes it unnecessary, but Bailey firmly insists they honor the patient\u2019s wishes.
