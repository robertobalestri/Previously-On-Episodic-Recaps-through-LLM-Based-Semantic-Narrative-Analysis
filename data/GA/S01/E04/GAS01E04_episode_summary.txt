The episode began with Meredith Grey narrating her thoughts on intimacy, describing it as something people both desire and fear, and reflecting on how it connects to relatives, romance, and roommates. Early in the morning, Meredith navigated the awkwardness of sharing a house with her roommates, George O'Malley and Izzie Stevens. George felt uncomfortable when Izzie and Meredith walked around in their underwear while he was naked in the shower, but Izzie teased him and told him to get used to it. The three argued about household responsibilities, including buying tampons, which George refused to do, insisting that as a man, he didn't buy “girl products.”

At the hospital, Cristina Yang instructed the interns on how to conduct pre-rounds, emphasizing the importance of bedside manner and making residents look good to avoid trouble. Cristina, Izzie, and Meredith discussed their hopes for interesting cases, with Cristina hoping to scrub in on a Whipple procedure for Elizabeth Fallon, a former scrub nurse at the hospital who was now a patient with pancreatic cancer. When Cristina met Nurse Fallon, Fallon immediately recognized Cristina's ambition and called her out for trying to get assigned to her surgery, insisting on being called Nurse Fallon and referring to Cristina as “Christina.”

Meanwhile, Izzie attempted to examine Mr. Humphrey, a patient scheduled for a prostate biopsy, but he refused, preferring Dr. Bailey or Dr. Victor instead. George continued to struggle with the roommate situation and asked Meredith if she thought he had a crush on Izzie, which he denied, saying he was attracted to someone else. Their conversation was interrupted when Dr. Bailey paged George and Meredith to assist Dr. Shepherd in trauma.

The trauma patient, Jorge Cruz, had fallen down stairs while holding a nail gun, resulting in seven nails embedded in his skull. Meredith, George, Izzie, Alex Karev, and Derek Shepherd worked together to stabilize Jorge, who was conscious but blind. With the CT scanner down, they opted for X-rays and a C-Arm insertion to guide the removal of the nails. Jorge's wife, Sona, arrived, and the team gathered his medical history, learning he had been experiencing headaches and dizziness for months.

Dr. Bailey presented Nurse Fallon's case to the attending physicians. Cristina was disappointed to learn that Meredith would be assigned to Fallon instead of her. Fallon revealed that she had been Ellis Grey's scrub nurse for eighteen years but had never met Meredith, Ellis's daughter.

In the locker room, Alex Karev questioned George about living with Meredith and Izzie, asking if they walked around in sexy underwear and if it was like living with sisters. George awkwardly denied it, insisting it wasn't like that.

Cristina and Izzie researched nail gun injuries to the head, finding twenty-three documented cases, most accidental. The team prepared for Jorge's surgery, discussing the risks of bleeding and infection and the importance of removing the nails at the exact angle they entered. During rounds, Dr. Burke assigned Cristina to get a history from Jorge before scrubbing in. Jorge's wife Sona scolded him for the accident, and the team continued to prepare for surgery. The surgery was successful, and the team waited to see if Jorge's vision would return.

Nurse Fallon's condition worsened, with labs showing elevated liver enzymes and worsening jaundice. Cristina and Izzie pushed Dr. Burke to schedule the Whipple procedure, but he wanted to wait for biopsy results. Dr. Bailey suspected Burke never intended to operate, believing Fallon was admitted to die in the hospital where she spent her career.

Meredith learned from Richard Webber that her mother, Ellis Grey, was in a nursing home with early-onset Alzheimer's and didn't want anyone to know. Richard was the only person Ellis allowed to visit her.

Izzie faced ridicule from other interns and staff after her lingerie modeling photos appeared in a magazine. She confronted Mr. Humphrey, who admitted he fantasized about her as a model and didn't want her present during his emasculating surgery. Izzie asserted her professionalism and demanded to be treated as a doctor.

Cristina and Izzie discussed Fallon's worsening condition, with Cristina frustrated that the hospital was just letting her die. Meredith argued that sometimes doing everything could be worse than doing nothing, while Cristina insisted she would want doctors to fight for her life until the end.

In the operating room, Izzie and Cristina advocated for saving Mr. Humphrey's nerves during his prostatectomy, arguing that preserving his chance at a normal sex life was important. Dr. Victor, initially resistant, relented and let Izzie take over the surgery. Dr. Bailey warned Izzie and Cristina that she would report them to Richard Webber, but ultimately supported their decision to give the patient what he wanted.

Jorge Cruz faced a difficult decision about his brain tumor. Derek Shepherd explained the options: removing the tumor could give him five to ten good years but risk memory and personality loss, while focused radiation would preserve his identity but only offer three to five years. Sona insisted the choice was Jorge's, even if it meant ten bad years for her, because she would remember for both of them.

Nurse Fallon's condition deteriorated, and despite efforts to resuscitate her, she died. The team called her time of death.

The episode ended with Meredith reflecting on intimacy and the lack of a rule book for it, musing that perhaps the rules of intimacy are something each person must define for themselves. At home, the roommates continued their banter, with Meredith warning them not to use her toothbrush. Meredith wished the patient good night, closing the episode as the characters grappled with professional boundaries, personal relationships, and the emotional complexities of medicine, highlighting the challenges of intimacy in both their personal and professional lives.
