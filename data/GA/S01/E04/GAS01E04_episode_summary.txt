A reflective voice opened the story, musing on the complexities of intimacy and the tangled relationships that come with relatives, romance, and roommates. The narration was punctuated by glimpses of daily life, such as someone asking about a toothbrush and a mention of running out of tampons, setting a tone of both longing and discomfort in close relationships.

In the shared bathroom of their house, George found himself in a heated argument with a female roommate about boundaries and chores. She walked around in her underwear, which made George visibly uncomfortable, especially when she asked him to buy tampons. George insisted he did not want to buy “girl products” and protested against seeing his roommates in such states of undress, highlighting the tension and gendered expectations that came with their living arrangement.

At the hospital, a resident instructed the interns on the importance of pre-rounds, emphasizing that politeness with patients would encourage them to share information that could be relayed to the attending physician. The resident warned the group that any mistake making the resident look bad would result in harsh consequences, and ordered them to complete their rounds by 5:30 a.m.

In the hospital corridor, Alex greeted Izzie with the nickname “Dr. Model,” sparking a sarcastic exchange about tattoos and rumors. Cristina, frustrated with her previous assignments, expressed hope for a better surgical opportunity. She and Alex discussed arriving early to impress Dr. Burke, and when Alex insinuated Cristina was involved with an attending, Cristina quickly denied it.

Cristina entered the room of Elizabeth Fallon, a former scrub nurse now battling pancreatic cancer. Fallon immediately saw through Cristina's eagerness, realizing she wanted to impress Dr. Burke and secure a spot in surgery. Fallon insisted on being called “Nurse Fallon” and addressed Cristina by her first name, establishing her authority.

Meanwhile, Izzie attempted to examine Mr. Humphrey, a patient scheduled for a biopsy. However, he recognized her from a magazine photo and refused to let her treat him, demanding another doctor and ordering Izzie out.

Back at the interns' house, Meredith, George, and Izzie debated the need for house rules about nudity and boundaries. George's discomfort was evident, and he was teased about possibly having a crush on Izzie. Their discussion was interrupted by a hospital page summoning O'Malley, Grey, and Karev to trauma.

In the trauma bay, Jorge Cruz arrived with multiple nails embedded in his skull after a fall involving a nail gun. George and Meredith worked to stabilize him. Jorge was conscious but blind, and with the CT scanner down, the team decided to use X-rays and a C-Arm. Jorge's wife, Sona, was on her way.

Cristina presented Elizabeth Fallon's case to Dr. Burke, who noted Cristina's ambition. Burke revealed he had planned to assign Fallon to Meredith, Ellis Grey's daughter, hoping they would have something to talk about. Fallon, however, was skeptical, saying she never met Meredith during her years with Ellis. Another doctor mentioned that Meredith was assisting on the nail gun case.

Dr. Burke instructed Meredith to conduct further tests for Nurse Fallon, including blood work, an MRI, an enema, and a biopsy, emphasizing that Fallon was an institution at the hospital and needed special care.

Meredith interviewed Jorge Cruz about his health and headaches. Sona arrived and scolded Jorge for his accident, then provided more history, describing his recent symptoms of headaches and lightheadedness.

George discussed the awkward living situation with another male intern, who asked about Meredith and Izzie walking around in their underwear. George tried to downplay it, comparing their relationship to that of siblings, though he was clearly conflicted.

Izzie was again prevented from participating in Mr. Humphrey's biopsy, as he insisted she leave the room. Another doctor tried to calm Mr. Humphrey as the procedure began.

Meredith continued gathering information from Sona about Jorge's symptoms, learning that his dizziness and disorientation had persisted for months.

Izzie and another intern discussed Mr. Humphrey's refusal to let her treat him, revealing he had seen her in a lingerie magazine ad. Izzie was frustrated, but Dr. Bailey insisted she continue with the case and expected her in surgery if the biopsy was positive.

Meredith and another doctor discussed Jorge's symptoms and considered that he might have lost consciousness due to an underlying condition, such as a tumor, but decided to focus on getting him through surgery first.

The surgical team prepared to remove the nails from Jorge's skull. Cristina and Alex compared their cases, with Cristina hoping for the Whipple procedure. The team reviewed X-rays and prepared for the delicate extraction.

Cristina was questioned by Dr. Burke about Nurse Fallon's blood work and was told to take her for an MRI. Cristina expressed her desire to participate in the Whipple surgery, but Burke told her to stick with Fallon overnight.

Meredith visited her mother, Ellis Grey, and showed her old family photos, trying to prompt memories. Ellis did not recognize her husband or daughter in the pictures, revealing the extent of her memory loss.

Meredith told Ellis that she saw Liz Fallon at the hospital. Ellis remembered Liz fondly and asked about her, and Meredith confirmed Liz was an excellent scrub nurse.

Back at home, George, Meredith, and Izzie argued about George's refusal to buy tampons. The women insisted he needed to get used to living with women, but George protested, declaring he was not their sister.

The next morning, Jorge Cruz was awake and able to recognize the color of his wife's dress, suggesting some of his vision had returned. Meredith and Sona checked on him and were pleased with his progress.

Cristina was reprimanded by Dr. Burke for waking a patient too abruptly. Burke told Cristina that this was the life of a surgeon and that she should not expect sympathy.

In the locker room, Izzie confronted her colleagues about the “Dr. Model” nickname and the attention her modeling past received. She exposed her tattoos and body to make a point, asserting her qualifications as a doctor and reminding them that she was debt-free thanks to her modeling work.

Meredith and Sona discussed Jorge's daily routine, including his breakfast habits. Meredith explained that Jorge needed an MRI to check for residual bleeding.

Izzie confronted Mr. Humphrey about his refusal to let her treat him. He admitted he had fantasized about her from her modeling photo and felt emasculated by the prospect of her witnessing his prostate surgery. Izzie asserted her professionalism and demanded to be allowed to do her job.

Cristina and Dr. Burke discussed Nurse Fallon's deteriorating condition. Cristina pushed for the Whipple surgery, but Burke was noncommittal, saying they would review her biopsy and overnight labs before deciding.

Meredith and another doctor reviewed Jorge's MRI and discovered a tumor in the hypothalamus. They discussed treatment options: surgical removal, which risked memory and personality loss but could give five to ten years, or focused radiation, which was less risky but offered only three to five years.

Meredith returned to Liz Fallon and revealed Ellis Grey's diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's. Liz was surprised and commented on Ellis's dedication to the hospital. Meredith explained that Ellis was in a nursing home and wanted her condition kept secret.

In a discussion among doctors, it was revealed that some believed Liz Fallon had been brought to the hospital to die, while others argued that everything possible should be done for her. The debate centered on the ethics of aggressive treatment versus palliative care.

Izzie and another female intern discussed body image and the perception of Izzie's modeling past. Izzie explained that her appearance was due to makeup and retouching, and the others joked about hating her for her looks.

Izzie was paged by Dr. Bailey and told that Mr. Humphrey's behavior did not excuse her from her duties. Izzie was upset by the continued references to her modeling nickname and struggled with her role in the prostatectomy surgery.

Jorge and Sona were told about the risks and benefits of surgery versus radiation for his brain tumor. Sona struggled with the decision, wanting to preserve Jorge's personality and memories even if it meant fewer years together. Meredith tried to help, but Sona insisted the decision was Jorge's.

Cristina discovered that the Whipple surgery for Liz Fallon was never intended to happen and realized she had been subjected to a hazing ritual. Suddenly, Liz's condition deteriorated. Cristina and others attempted to resuscitate her, but she was DNR, and they were ordered to let her go.

In the operating room, Izzie and Dr. Bailey advocated for nerve-sparing during Mr. Humphrey's prostatectomy, arguing for the patient's quality of life. Dr. Victor was reluctant but ultimately agreed to attempt the more complex procedure.

Cristina and Meredith discussed the emotional toll of losing patients and the lack of clear rules for intimacy and boundaries in their lives. Meredith reflected on the difficulty of knowing when lines had been crossed.

A time of death was called for Liz Fallon. Meredith's narration returned, reflecting on the lack of a rule book for intimacy and the challenge of recognizing boundaries. The episode closed with scenes of the interns at home, discussing toothbrushes and house rules, and Meredith reflecting that perhaps the rules of intimacy must be defined individually. The group said good night, each left to navigate the complexities of their shared lives.
