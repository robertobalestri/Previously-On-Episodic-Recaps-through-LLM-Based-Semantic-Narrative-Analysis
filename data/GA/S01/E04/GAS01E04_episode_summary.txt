Meredith Grey began the day reflecting on the complexities of intimacy, considering how it is both craved and feared, and how living with relatives, romantic partners, or roommates can make life complicated. Early in the morning, Meredith's roommate Izzie asked if someone was using her toothbrush, highlighting the awkwardness of their shared living situation. In the kitchen, Izzie greeted a cat while George O'Malley complained about the lack of privacy, referencing how the women walked around in their underwear while he was naked in the shower. Izzie asked George to buy tampons, but he refused, insisting he would not buy “girl products.” Meredith added tampons to the shopping list and reminded George it was his turn to shop, while Izzie teased him by flaunting her underwear.

At the hospital, Dr. Miranda Bailey reminded the interns, including Meredith, Izzie, George, Cristina Yang, and Alex Karev, to be polite and considerate with patients during pre-rounds, emphasizing that making patients comfortable was crucial for gathering information. Dr. Bailey warned that if the interns made her look bad, they would be punished, and ordered them to complete pre-rounds by 5:30 a.m.

Alex greeted Izzie with a mocking “Dr. Model,” referencing her past as a lingerie model. Izzie retorted, and Cristina complained about her previous day's assignments, hoping for better patients. The interns discussed their early arrival times, with Cristina boasting about being there at 4 a.m. Alex implied that Cristina was only ambitious because she was not involved with an attending, a dig at Meredith's rumored relationship with Dr. Derek Shepherd. Meredith denied any inappropriate relationship.

Dr. Shepherd arrived early and offered to buy Meredith breakfast, but she declined, saying she had already eaten. Cristina, overhearing, made sarcastic remarks about Meredith's breakfast habits and insisted on maintaining professionalism, not wanting to be seen with Meredith in the hospital due to the rumors.

Cristina met Elizabeth Fallon, a former scrub nurse now admitted with pancreatic cancer. Fallon recognized Cristina's ambition and called her out for trying to secure a spot in her surgery, insisting on being called “Nurse Fallon” and calling Cristina “Christina.” Cristina then checked on Mr. Humphrey, who was resistant to being examined by Izzie after recognizing her from a lingerie ad and demanded another doctor, making Izzie uncomfortable.

Back at the house, the roommates debated setting rules about nudity and boundaries. Cristina asked George if he had a crush on Izzie, which he denied, clarifying that he was attracted to someone else. The conversation was interrupted when Dr. Bailey ordered George and Meredith to assist Dr. Shepherd in trauma.

The trauma case involved Jorge Cruz, who had accidentally shot seven nails into his skull with a nail gun. Jorge was conscious but blind. The team discussed the risks and options for imaging, ultimately deciding on using X-rays and a C-Arm due to the metal in Jorge's head. Jorge's wife, Sona, arrived, upset with him for using the nail gun, and his partner Javi shared Jorge's recent symptoms with Dr. Shepherd.

Cristina presented Nurse Fallon's case to Dr. Preston Burke, hoping to assist in a Whipple procedure. Liz, a scrub nurse, gossiped about Cristina's ambition and noted that Meredith was Ellis Grey's daughter. Dr. Burke assigned Meredith to Fallon's case, thinking she and Liz might have something to talk about, but Liz doubted it, having never met Meredith despite working with Ellis for 18 years.

Izzie took Jorge's history, learning about his headaches and his wife's dislike of guns. The interns researched nail gun injuries, discovering 23 documented cases. Alex teased George about living with women who walked around in their underwear, and George awkwardly tried to explain their relationship as not being like siblings.

Dr. Shepherd prepared for Mr. Humphrey's prostate biopsy, but Mr. Humphrey refused to let Izzie participate due to her modeling past. Cristina and Alex discussed the situation, and Cristina later confronted Izzie about hiding in the hallway. Cristina told Izzie to act like a doctor and do her job, regardless of the patient's attitude.

Dr. Shepherd and Dr. Bailey discussed Jorge's case, considering possible causes for his fall, including a tumor. Meredith summarized the key risks in removing the nails from Jorge's head. The team prepared for the delicate surgery, and Dr. Richard Webber jokingly referred to Izzie as “Dr. Bethany Whisperer,” referencing her modeling alias.

A patient's husband reminisced about his wife's love for the color red, sharing a memory about her running through a field of red poppies. Dr. Shepherd discussed Mr. Humphrey's prognosis, suggesting a radical prostatectomy with a good chance for a normal sex life. The older patient preferred a more conservative approach, and Dr. Burke joked about another surgeon's reputation for not sparing nerves.

During Jorge's surgery, Dr. Bailey explained the importance of removing the nails at the correct angle to avoid further damage. The interns observed, and Alex commented on the X-rays. Cristina and George discussed their hopes for getting to assist in a Whipple procedure. Izzie and George had another awkward exchange about tampons and gender roles.

Meredith and Cristina discussed the importance of remembering patients' names versus just their surgeries. Dr. Shepherd added that some surgeons distance themselves to avoid personal entanglements. Liz's husband visited her, and the interns and nurses checked on her, exchanging friendly banter.

After Jorge's surgery, the team waited to see if his vision would return. Cristina checked with Dr. Burke about scheduling the Whipple for Fallon, but Burke wanted to wait for more lab results. He instructed Cristina to stick with Fallon, and Cristina confirmed she was on call.

Later, Liz Fallon and Meredith had a conversation about Ellis Grey. Liz reminisced about Ellis's work ethic and questioned Meredith about her mother's whereabouts. Meredith lied, saying Ellis was traveling and not practicing, and Liz noted that did not sound like her. The conversation revealed Ellis was actually in a nursing home with early-onset Alzheimer's, a secret Meredith kept from most people.

At home, Izzie and George argued again about the tampons, with Izzie insisting George needed to get over his discomfort with women's issues. George protested that he was not their sister.

The next morning, the roommates discussed breakfast, and Izzie checked on Jorge, who was awake. Elizabeth Fallon asked Jorge to identify the color of her dress, and he confidently answered, showing some memory had returned.

Cristina was reprimanded for waking a patient abruptly and complained about being tired from being on call. Dr. Burke told her not to feel sorry for herself, emphasizing that this was the life of a surgeon. Sona and Jorge joked about his breakfast preferences, and Meredith prepared Jorge for an MRI to check for residual bleeding.

Izzie confronted Mr. Humphrey about his refusal to let her treat him, asserting her qualifications as a doctor and demanding respect. Mr. Humphrey admitted he fantasized about her modeling photo and did not want her to witness his emasculation during surgery.

Meredith and Elizabeth Fallon discussed Fallon's worsening labs and the lack of progress. Meredith pushed for the Whipple surgery, but Fallon was evasive, and Meredith accused her of never intending to operate. Cristina and Meredith discovered Jorge had a tumor in the hypothalamus, and they discussed treatment options with his family: surgery with a risk of memory loss or less invasive radiation with a shorter life expectancy.

Richard Webber told Meredith that his mother remembered Ellis Grey, and Meredith confirmed Ellis's diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's to Cristina, explaining why she kept it secret. Cristina called Ellis a “bitch” for her workaholic ways, and Izzie reflected on Ellis's dedication to the hospital.

Cristina expressed her frustration about the attention Izzie got for her looks, and Izzie downplayed it as makeup and retouching. Cristina joked that if she looked like Izzie, she would walk around naked all the time.

Dr. Bailey scolded the interns for not answering their pages promptly. Sona struggled with the decision about Jorge's surgery, ultimately supporting whatever Jorge wanted, even if it meant years of hardship for her. Izzie apologized for overstepping.

During a code, Liz Fallon's condition deteriorated. Cristina and others attempted to resuscitate her, but she was DNR (do not resuscitate), and the team was forced to let her go. Izzie and Alex discussed the earlier argument about emasculation, and Izzie apologized.

In surgery, Izzie stood up to Dr. Victor, insisting on saving Mr. Humphrey's nerves to preserve his quality of life, as he requested. Dr. Bailey supported Izzie's advocacy for the patient's wishes, and the team proceeded with the nerve-sparing approach.

Meredith reflected on the lack of a rule book for intimacy and the need to define boundaries for oneself. At home, Meredith warned Izzie not to use her toothbrush, and Izzie assured her she was not. Meredith concluded that the rules of intimacy are personal, and the day ended with Izzie wishing Meredith good night.
