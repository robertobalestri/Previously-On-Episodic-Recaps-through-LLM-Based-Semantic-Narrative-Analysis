[izzie_stevens], [meredith_grey], and [george_omalley] are getting ready for the day.
[izzie_stevens] walks around in [izzie_stevens]'s underwear.
[george_omalley] feels embarrassed by [izzie_stevens]'s behavior.
[george_omalley] complains on the way to the hospital, but [meredith_grey] and [izzie_stevens] find [george_omalley]'s complaints funny.
Derek wants to take [meredith_grey] out for breakfast and flirts with [meredith_grey], which annoys [meredith_grey].
A veteran scrub nurse named [liz_fallon] is admitted to Seattle Grace, creating a buzz.
[cristina_yang] is assigned to [liz_fallon] while on [preston_burke]'s service.
[liz_fallon] mocks [cristina_yang] for taking [liz_fallon]'s chart to impress [preston_burke].
[izzie_stevens]'s patient, [mr_humphrey], who has prostate cancer, refuses [izzie_stevens] for his biopsy.
This leads to [miranda_bailey] scolding [izzie_stevens].
[george_omalley] meets up with [izzie_stevens] and [meredith_grey] to share [george_omalley]'s complaints about the morning.
[alex_karev] and [meredith_grey] are called to help Derek with a trauma case.
Derek's patient, [jorge_cruz], injured himself after falling down the stairs while holding a nail gun.
[jorge_cruz] has sixteen nails in his head and is getting worse.
[liz_fallon], a former scrub nurse for [ellis_grey], learns from [richard_webber] that [meredith_grey] is now at Seattle Grace.
[izzie_stevens] tries to approach [mr_humphrey], but [mr_humphrey] insists [izzie_stevens] leave.
[izzie_stevens] realizes [mr_humphrey] saw a photoshoot of [izzie_stevens]'s that was recently published.
[zona_cruz], [jorge_cruz]'s wife, must decide about surgery to remove the nails, which is very risky and could be fatal.
[george_omalley] helps by researching nail gun cases and finds twenty-three incidents, including one suicide. [mr_humphrey]'s surgeon is Dr. Harry Victor, nicknamed "Limp Harry" for his aggressive methods. Dr. Victor plans to remove [mr_humphrey]'s entire prostate, which would prevent [mr_humphrey] from having an erection. [george_omalley] continues to worry about the morning's events. [izzie_stevens] tells [george_omalley] to buy her tampons during [george_omalley]'s grocery run. [meredith_grey] visits her mother. [meredith_grey] is shocked that [ellis_grey] remembers [liz_fallon], her scrub nurse, but not her own daughter. [izzie_stevens] and [meredith_grey] are angry with [george_omalley] for not buying tampons. [george_omalley] defends himself by saying that men don’t buy tampons. [cristina_yang] returns to check [liz_fallon]'s vitals. [liz_fallon] asks [cristina_yang] if [cristina_yang] has anyone waiting for [cristina_yang] at home. [izzie_stevens] enters the locker room and is upset to learn that [izzie_stevens]'s past as a model has been revealed. [alex_karev] printed large photos of [izzie_stevens]'s modeling shoots and put them all over the locker room. [izzie_stevens] confronts [alex_karev]. [izzie_stevens] angrily tells [alex_karev] that [alex_karev] can keep calling her "Dr. Model," but [izzie_stevens] graduated without medical debt, unlike [alex_karev] and many of their peers. [izzie_stevens] goes back to [mr_humphrey] to address [mr_humphrey]'s supposed chauvinism. [mr_humphrey] explains that it was not chauvinism; [mr_humphrey] had been fantasizing about [izzie_stevens] since seeing the photo and didn’t want [izzie_stevens] to see him looking weak. [cristina_yang] confronts [preston_burke] about sending [cristina_yang] for unnecessary tests on [liz_fallon].
Dr. Harry Victor tells [liz_fallon] that [liz_fallon] is terminal and has been admitted to Seattle Grace to die.
[meredith_grey] visits [liz_fallon], and [meredith_grey] and [liz_fallon] remember [ellis_grey] together.
Later that evening, [liz_fallon] goes into cardiac arrest and dies, as [liz_fallon] had signed a do-not-resuscitate order.
[meredith_grey] finds out that [jorge_cruz] and [zona_cruz] want to proceed with surgery.
[meredith_grey] tries to convince [zona_cruz] not to go through with it.
[meredith_grey] asks [zona_cruz] if five good years are better than ten bad ones.
[zona_cruz] replies that [zona_cruz] prefers more time with [jorge_cruz], even if it means caring for [jorge_cruz].
Derek pulls [meredith_grey] aside and reminds [meredith_grey] that this is their decision.
[izzie_stevens] supports [mr_humphrey] and tells Dr. Harry Victor not to cut the nerves.
[miranda_bailey] agrees with [izzie_stevens].
