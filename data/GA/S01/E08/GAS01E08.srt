1
00:00:04,198 --> 00:00:07,383
You know how when you were a little kid and you believed in fairy tales?

2
00:00:08,845 --> 00:00:13,910
That fantasy of what your life would be.

3
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:19,757
White dress, Prince Charming who'd carry you away to a castle on a hill.

4
00:00:21,681 --> 00:00:26,746
You'd lie in bed at night and close your eyes and you had complete and utter faith.

5
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:34,369
Eight hours, 16 ounces of chocolate, and 32 cupcakes, and they still don't taste right.

6
00:00:34,892 --> 00:00:36,215
No, these are good.

7
00:00:36,756 --> 00:00:38,121
Martha Stewart would be proud.

8
00:00:38,643 --> 00:00:39,505
Yeah, look where I got her.

9
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:43,621
Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, Prince Charming.

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,344
They were so close, you could taste them.

11
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:48,987
There's something missing, some specific ingredient.

12
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:49,968
Why can't I remember?

13
00:00:50,307 --> 00:00:52,090
But eventually, you grow up.

14
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,554
One day, you open your eyes, and the fairy tale disappears.

15
00:00:56,755 --> 00:00:58,017
Look, just call her.

16
00:00:58,036 --> 00:00:59,218
Call your mother and ask.

17
00:00:59,237 --> 00:01:02,140
Most people turn to the things and people they can trust.

18
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:03,482
I don't want to call my mother.

19
00:01:07,486 --> 00:01:09,289
So let's go sleep at your house tonight.

20
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:10,352
What?

21
00:01:10,754 --> 00:01:12,516
I mean, why are we always sleeping at my house?

22
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:13,998
Do you even have one?

23
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:14,780
One what?

24
00:01:15,381 --> 00:01:20,808
A house with a closet, with your stuff in it, your personal stuff.

25
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:22,850
Do you even have one of those?

26
00:01:26,856 --> 00:01:27,358
Good morning.

27
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:28,540
Hey.

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,540
You guys want a cupcake?

29
00:01:30,242 --> 00:01:30,703
Easy made them.

30
00:01:32,165 --> 00:01:32,926
You know, I like it here.

31
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,528
Hey, you said so yourself.

32
00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:37,793
You like to have your things around, sleeping in your own bed.

33
00:01:38,073 --> 00:01:39,816
You're like a health nut, aren't you?

34
00:01:40,504 --> 00:01:41,947
Can I eat muesli every morning?

35
00:01:41,987 --> 00:01:44,993
No, I don't.

36
00:01:46,215 --> 00:01:47,959
Okay, the muesli thing, you do.

37
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:49,582
The last seven days at least.

38
00:01:49,804 --> 00:01:50,444
Oh, come on.

39
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:53,450
I haven't been here for a whole week.

40
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,253
See?

41
00:01:58,515 --> 00:01:59,638
Even they think it's weird.

42
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:15,591
But the thing is, it's hard to let go of that fairy tale entirely, because almost everyone still has that smallest bit of hope, of faith, that one day they'll open their eyes and it will all come true.

43
00:02:25,627 --> 00:02:26,908
So I've checked the schedule.

44
00:02:27,149 --> 00:02:28,350
I start ENT on the 9th.

45
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,632
It's a light rotation.

46
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:30,492
Can you get me in then?

47
00:02:31,413 --> 00:02:32,514
Oh, I'm afraid not.

48
00:02:33,836 --> 00:02:35,457
We have openings on the 16th.

49
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:40,401
There are other options besides termination, you know.

50
00:02:41,223 --> 00:02:41,783
Adoption.

51
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:43,846
Keeping the baby.

52
00:02:46,147 --> 00:02:46,829
You think it over.

53
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:47,389
Call me back.

54
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:48,330
I'm here all day.

55
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:49,350
Put me down for the 16th.

56
00:02:49,371 --> 00:02:51,432
I'll confirm after I rearrange my schedule.

57
00:02:52,712 --> 00:02:54,375
I know this is a difficult decision.

58
00:02:54,395 --> 00:02:55,515
Okay, you know the talking part?

59
00:02:57,198 --> 00:02:57,818
I'm not interested.

60
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:03,444
So, Devo, you just had a root canal, correct?

61
00:03:04,145 --> 00:03:04,806
Yeah.

62
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:05,948
Couldn't stop bleeding after.

63
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:06,829
Literally.

64
00:03:07,248 --> 00:03:08,210
Now I'm stuck with you guys.

65
00:03:09,831 --> 00:03:10,393
Give me the bullet.

66
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:15,038
A 17-year-old female hospitalized for excessive bleeding status post-root canal.

67
00:03:15,298 --> 00:03:17,941
Also had a significant new heart murmur associated with fever.

68
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:19,782
Now a fever along with antibiotics.

69
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:21,431
I'm going to die.

70
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,352
Can you pay for Mom and Dad?

71
00:03:22,431 --> 00:03:23,152
You're not dying.

72
00:03:23,593 --> 00:03:24,335
Where are your parents?

73
00:03:24,634 --> 00:03:25,515
In the cafeteria.

74
00:03:25,937 --> 00:03:27,459
My freak father likes hospital food.

75
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:29,420
You're in excellent hands here.

76
00:03:29,461 --> 00:03:31,122
Dr. Karev is going to run some labs.

77
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:34,347
And I'll see you with your parents in a little while.

78
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:37,050
Add a bleeding time to the coax.

79
00:03:39,013 --> 00:03:42,298
So what kind of name is Devo anyway?

80
00:03:42,818 --> 00:03:43,519
He's a rocker.

81
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,262
My parents did too much blow.

82
00:03:46,462 --> 00:03:47,965
I call myself Esther.

83
00:03:48,332 --> 00:03:49,294
Nice skirt, Esther.

84
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,679
What are you, Amish?

85
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:51,159
Get a life.

86
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:53,125
Haven't you ever seen an Orthodox Jew?

87
00:03:57,335 --> 00:03:59,019
This guy belongs in psych.

88
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:00,100
What are you doing turfing him here?

89
00:04:00,603 --> 00:04:01,403
He's my gift to you.

90
00:04:01,685 --> 00:04:04,131
Had a seizure two days ago and another one this morning.

91
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,393
What are you talking about?

92
00:04:05,432 --> 00:04:10,358
It says right here he talks to dead people, his family thinks he's dangerous, and they had him committed.

93
00:04:10,737 --> 00:04:12,680
That's psych, not neuro.

94
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:13,961
Man, didn't you go to med school?

95
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,903
Yes, and unlike the correspondence school you attended.

96
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,346
Oh, yeah, the W. Stanford, right?

97
00:04:18,365 --> 00:04:18,665
Correspondence.

98
00:04:18,685 --> 00:04:20,307
I learned not to jump to conclusions.

99
00:04:20,788 --> 00:04:21,348
Sorry, ladies.

100
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:22,930
We can't take him back until he's cleared.

101
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,471
So you're dumping him on us.

102
00:04:24,992 --> 00:04:26,774
He thinks his seizures are visions.

103
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:28,535
Hello, they're not seizures.

104
00:04:28,595 --> 00:04:29,255
I'm psychic.

105
00:04:29,495 --> 00:04:31,418
Of course you are, and I'm a chicken.

106
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,543
Yay, genius!

107
00:04:33,682 --> 00:04:38,987
Okay, Mr. Duff, we're gonna start our work up now.

108
00:04:39,007 --> 00:04:40,348
Work me up, work me down.

109
00:04:40,428 --> 00:04:41,689
I'm telling you, it's a waste of time.

110
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:42,411
Okay, well, humor us.

111
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,711
Can you grip my fingers, please?

112
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,401
Christina.

113
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,822
Mr. Duff?

114
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:57,285
Mr. Duff, are you okay?

115
00:05:00,127 --> 00:05:00,266
No.

116
00:05:00,286 --> 00:05:00,848
Someone...

117
00:05:01,704 --> 00:05:02,346
Someone what?

118
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:05,115
Someone's going to check out.

119
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:06,959
Bye bye.

120
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,262
Man, he's nuts.

121
00:05:08,504 --> 00:05:09,968
I'm dizzy, not deaf, lady.

122
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:12,475
And I'm telling you, someone on the fourth floor is going to die.

123
00:06:06,454 --> 00:06:07,757
Fourth floor, dead guide.

124
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:09,720
Psychic predicted fourth floor, dead guide.

125
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:12,204
I need someone to cover me on the 16th.

126
00:06:12,444 --> 00:06:12,665
You in?

127
00:06:12,685 --> 00:06:15,790
I'm thinking about letting my hair grow.

128
00:06:16,451 --> 00:06:19,175
Maybe I won't shave, go for the stubble effect.

129
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:20,317
What do you think?

130
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:23,781
16th George, can you cover me or not?

131
00:06:24,762 --> 00:06:26,065
Uh, yeah, I guess.

132
00:06:26,225 --> 00:06:26,446
Why?

133
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:27,788
It's none of your business.

134
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,172
Thank you.

135
00:06:30,192 --> 00:06:32,175
You would be nice.

136
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,834
It's just that I hardly know anything about you.

137
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:35,915
You know I'm from New York.

138
00:06:35,935 --> 00:06:37,096
You know I like ferry boats.

139
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:38,579
Enough with the ferry boats.

140
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,680
What about your friends?

141
00:06:39,701 --> 00:06:40,302
I'm a surgeon.

142
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:41,122
I don't have friends.

143
00:06:41,262 --> 00:06:42,404
Everybody has friends.

144
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:44,709
I mean, who do you hang out with?

145
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:46,851
What do you do on your days off?

146
00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:48,394
These are important questions.

147
00:06:48,413 --> 00:06:48,834
Ah, important.

148
00:06:48,935 --> 00:06:49,235
For who?

149
00:06:49,815 --> 00:06:51,077
We're having sex every night.

150
00:06:51,117 --> 00:06:52,560
I think I deserve details.

151
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:53,961
You have more details than most.

152
00:06:53,982 --> 00:06:55,964
See, this is going somewhere weird.

153
00:06:56,586 --> 00:06:57,326
I want facts.

154
00:06:57,548 --> 00:07:00,531
And until I get them, my pants are staying on.

155
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:01,774
Or you could just roll with it.

156
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:02,978
Be flexible.

157
00:07:03,398 --> 00:07:04,079
See what happens.

158
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,822
I'm not flexible.

159
00:07:06,882 --> 00:07:07,884
I dare disagree.

160
00:07:09,065 --> 00:07:09,766
I gotta go.

161
00:07:13,812 --> 00:07:14,793
Well, find these things out.

162
00:07:15,374 --> 00:07:16,355
That's the fun part, you know?

163
00:07:16,615 --> 00:07:17,117
That's the gravy.

164
00:07:17,697 --> 00:07:19,119
That is what I'm talking about.

165
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:21,281
I don't want to be your gravy.

166
00:07:26,036 --> 00:07:27,778
Your daughter needs a valve replacement.

167
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:33,326
Tests are indicative of von Willebrand's disease, which explains the excessive bleeding after the root canal.

168
00:07:33,346 --> 00:07:34,447
And that means?

169
00:07:34,528 --> 00:07:37,932
Devo can't take the blood thinners necessary to maintain a mechanical heart valve.

170
00:07:38,252 --> 00:07:40,115
We're suggesting a porcine valve instead.

171
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:41,338
Porcine?

172
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,060
As in pig?

173
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,562
It's the standard of care for someone in this situation.

174
00:07:47,225 --> 00:07:49,067
Pig, huh?

175
00:07:49,088 --> 00:07:51,130
It's the other white meat.

176
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:52,232
I don't care what you have to do.

177
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:53,613
Save my daughter's life.

178
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,185
Dr. Jennings to OR7.

179
00:07:57,204 --> 00:07:58,548
Dr. Jennings to OR7.

180
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:03,737
I'm removing the lump now.

181
00:08:03,778 --> 00:08:06,863
Someone said you guys have a psychic running around here.

182
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:07,805
Is that true?

183
00:08:07,836 --> 00:08:09,899
I did not even hear you say that.

184
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:11,821
I predicted someone would die on the fourth floor.

185
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,403
ICU's on the fourth floor.

186
00:08:13,423 --> 00:08:14,403
People die all the time.

187
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:15,084
OK.

188
00:08:15,504 --> 00:08:17,646
We'll be finishing up here, Mrs. Glass.

189
00:08:18,088 --> 00:08:24,314
We'll take this down the path, get the results of the frozen section biopsy, and see you in a few hours.

190
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:26,255
Seriously, the guy's just playing mind games.

191
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:28,499
I can see further into the future than he can.

192
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,980
Why do you even care about this, Stevens?

193
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:31,963
I don't.

194
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,168
OK, Mr. Walker, does that hurt?

195
00:08:38,312 --> 00:08:39,995
I can't feel anything until you get to my thigh.

196
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:42,157
Try wiggling your toes.

197
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:45,700
Are they moving?

198
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,022
No.

199
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:49,102
Damn.

200
00:08:49,123 --> 00:08:50,163
I could about 10 minutes ago.

201
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:53,346
Well, your spine X-rays look clear.

202
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:54,988
You fell rock climbing?

203
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:55,729
In Snohomish.

204
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:56,590
Just a small drop.

205
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:57,269
I was belayed.

206
00:08:59,231 --> 00:09:00,232
My wife and boys are on the way.

207
00:09:01,494 --> 00:09:02,394
What's wrong with me, anyway?

208
00:09:02,715 --> 00:09:07,779
Hold your legs up.

209
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:09,556
Should I be scared now?

210
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:10,456
No, just try and relax.

211
00:09:11,557 --> 00:09:13,541
Nurse, I need a stat MRI.

212
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:15,221
Send an intern with him.

213
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:17,424
Take it Meredith, correct?

214
00:09:17,445 --> 00:09:17,605
Mm-hmm.

215
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,769
Ooh, thick, short neck.

216
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:22,490
That isn't good.

217
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:23,571
It's hard to intubate.

218
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:24,211
You want me to do that?

219
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:25,212
He's my patient.

220
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:26,193
I'm fine.

221
00:09:26,214 --> 00:09:28,476
I just can't see anything yet.

222
00:09:28,496 --> 00:09:28,917
Suction.

223
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,861
Don't break any teeth on me.

224
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:33,182
I know that.

225
00:09:33,221 --> 00:09:34,222
Don't you think I know that?

226
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:39,649
Ball socks down 87%.

227
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:40,309
Damn.

228
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:40,870
Bag him.

229
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,913
I'll raise him.

230
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:44,014
Are you sure you don't want to do that?

231
00:09:44,174 --> 00:09:44,836
No, damn it.

232
00:09:45,157 --> 00:09:48,061
Dude.

233
00:09:53,908 --> 00:09:54,370
Got it.

234
00:09:59,236 --> 00:10:00,217
It's in the esophagus.

235
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:02,140
Don't you know an esophagus from a trachea?

236
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:02,642
Damn it.

237
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:04,585
Anatomy is all messed up in here.

238
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,167
Are you trying to kill this patient, O'Malley?

239
00:10:10,298 --> 00:10:12,881
No, it's just I haven't done this much.

240
00:10:14,344 --> 00:10:16,986
But when I have, it's been good.

241
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,631
It's just I haven't.

242
00:10:21,232 --> 00:10:22,455
Let's review the concept.

243
00:10:23,736 --> 00:10:24,738
Never take your eyes away.

244
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:28,202
Always, always know you can follow through.

245
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:31,868
I'll never follow through on one of my patients, O'Malley.

246
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,302
A little Botox would do wonders on those frown lines.

247
00:10:48,322 --> 00:10:49,625
Okay.

248
00:10:49,644 --> 00:10:50,024
Shut up.

249
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:53,307
Are you allowed to talk to me like that?

250
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:54,149
God, you're hot.

251
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,091
In a Mrs. Livingston kind of way.

252
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:56,892
See here?

253
00:10:56,932 --> 00:11:00,836
These are spikes in your temporal lobe.

254
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:03,118
It means you have epilepsy, not visions.

255
00:11:03,518 --> 00:11:03,918
Seizures.

256
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:04,980
You think I'm epileptic?

257
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:06,620
That is so not right.

258
00:11:07,182 --> 00:11:09,683
I'm gonna order an MRI so I can take a closer look at your brain.

259
00:11:09,744 --> 00:11:10,544
Yeah, there's no way.

260
00:11:16,312 --> 00:11:16,833
Mr. Duff?

261
00:11:18,014 --> 00:11:18,895
Mr. Duff, can you see me?

262
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:19,616
Can you hear me?

263
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:21,219
Stay with me.

264
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,623
Wouldn't have picked you for the mommy track, Nurse Betty.

265
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:33,673
See?

266
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,575
Told you I know things.

267
00:11:36,356 --> 00:11:40,261
This pregnancy thing, you can't run away from it.

268
00:11:47,227 --> 00:11:49,429
Dr. Bailey, I want off the psychic case.

269
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,311
I'll take whatever you got.

270
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:51,231
Can I switch?

271
00:11:51,572 --> 00:11:52,274
Ask nicely.

272
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:54,956
But this is me doing nicely.

273
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:57,879
Look, I know the type.

274
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,302
These guys just want everybody to think they're a sideshow.

275
00:12:00,322 --> 00:12:00,883
Let me take them.

276
00:12:01,323 --> 00:12:02,524
I don't do switches.

277
00:12:02,664 --> 00:12:04,307
I'll do your post-op notes for a month.

278
00:12:06,349 --> 00:12:06,730
Fine.

279
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:07,791
I can accept that.

280
00:12:08,451 --> 00:12:09,793
Izzy, you get psych guy.

281
00:12:10,092 --> 00:12:10,494
Yay.

282
00:12:10,614 --> 00:12:11,634
This is your lucky day.

283
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:13,778
You get to be with me on the breast cancer.

284
00:12:14,057 --> 00:12:15,940
And they're spotting, so you need to do a pelvic.

285
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,880
She's pregnant.

286
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:29,453
See?

287
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:31,197
This.

288
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:32,298
Your guy's films are clear.

289
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,065
There's no reason I can see for his creeping paralysis.

290
00:12:36,105 --> 00:12:37,287
It's just so surprising.

291
00:12:38,368 --> 00:12:42,414
I expected an intrusion into the spinal space, where bony sperm the nucleus proposes.

292
00:12:42,654 --> 00:12:43,475
Well, you were wrong.

293
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:45,720
You don't always get what you expect, do you?

294
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,572
What is your problem?

295
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:51,254
Give me something to go on.

296
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:52,255
Anything.

297
00:12:53,336 --> 00:12:54,438
What are your grandparents' names?

298
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:55,679
I don't have grandparents.

299
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,301
Where'd you grow up?

300
00:12:57,001 --> 00:12:58,524
What's your favorite flavor of ice cream?

301
00:12:58,804 --> 00:13:00,307
Where'd you spend your summer vacations?

302
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:01,187
Lighten up.

303
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,629
It'll be good for your blood pressure.

304
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,753
Oh, don't you tell me to lighten up.

305
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:08,719
I'll lighten up when I feel light.

306
00:13:11,643 --> 00:13:13,125
Don't we have treatment options?

307
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:15,268
I mean, aren't there always alternatives?

308
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:21,618
With this stage of invasive carcinoma, surgery, chemo, radiation, and drug therapy are your only options.

309
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,421
Can I wait until the end of my pregnancy?

310
00:13:24,022 --> 00:13:26,807
The pregnancy hormones will likely speed the growth of the cancer.

311
00:13:27,628 --> 00:13:28,129
And the baby?

312
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,433
Oh, none of these courses of treatment will allow the baby to survive.

313
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:37,083
Mr. and Mrs. Glass, I understand how difficult this is.

314
00:13:37,104 --> 00:13:39,147
No disrespect, but like hell you do.

315
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:44,525
You're going to have to make a decision as to how you want to proceed.

316
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,509
You mean my baby's life or my own?

317
00:13:49,753 --> 00:13:49,972
Yes.

318
00:13:57,182 --> 00:13:58,724
We'll have to evacuate the fetus.

319
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:08,195
Any changes, Mr. Walker?

320
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:10,298
I can't move my legs at all now.

321
00:14:10,395 --> 00:14:12,120
He said he was moving his legs when he came in.

322
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,162
What's wrong with them?

323
00:14:13,724 --> 00:14:14,164
I don't know.

324
00:14:15,226 --> 00:14:18,956
The paralysis is moving very quickly, and there was nothing in the MRI to explain it.

325
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:21,221
Has Tommy been under any stress lately?

326
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,826
You know what's making me stressed is being in here and not being able to move.

327
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:25,991
Dr. Gray.

328
00:14:28,063 --> 00:14:30,726
Emotional trauma can be converted into something physical, right?

329
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:31,548
This is possible.

330
00:14:32,109 --> 00:14:33,710
Like hysterical numbness or paralysis.

331
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,754
Maybe there is no physiological reason, and he's just having a conversion reaction.

332
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:39,236
You think it's psychosomatic?

333
00:14:39,256 --> 00:14:40,938
It is not in your head, man.

334
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:42,019
I believe you.

335
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,801
Mr. Duff, please.

336
00:14:46,024 --> 00:14:46,544
What was that?

337
00:14:47,306 --> 00:14:48,147
Psych sent him down.

338
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,028
He has visions.

339
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:49,889
Is that it?

340
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:51,409
Am I crazy?

341
00:14:52,552 --> 00:14:53,232
No, no.

342
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:56,316
I'm going to order a higher level MRI.

343
00:14:57,341 --> 00:14:58,303
We're going to figure this out.

344
00:15:04,134 --> 00:15:05,697
You know how important this is to me.

345
00:15:05,837 --> 00:15:07,480
This is about saving your life, sweetie.

346
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,684
And you're not respecting it, or me.

347
00:15:10,246 --> 00:15:18,422
You're letting them put a pig, a freaking non-kosher trade mammal, into my chest, into my heart, the very essence of my being.

348
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:20,336
It's a porcine valve, actually.

349
00:15:20,355 --> 00:15:21,717
I don't care what the hell it is.

350
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,182
If you give me a pig part, I might as well be dead.

351
00:15:24,361 --> 00:15:26,625
I told you this whole Orthodox thing was a mistake.

352
00:15:26,644 --> 00:15:29,589
What was so wrong with being clean or reformed like everyone else we know?

353
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:31,892
You guys don't even light candles Friday nights.

354
00:15:32,373 --> 00:15:34,394
You don't even know all the Passover plagues.

355
00:15:34,696 --> 00:15:37,078
Boils, vermin, pestilence, even I know that.

356
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:43,466
Miss Freeman, I appreciate your extreme religious convictions.

357
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:44,828
Fire, hail, slain, firstborn.

358
00:15:44,849 --> 00:15:47,633
But simply put, without this procedure, you will die.

359
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:50,773
You're hot shot, doctors.

360
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,315
You'll come up with something else.

361
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:57,061
As long as it doesn't answer to Wilbur and say oink, I don't care what it is.

362
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:09,116
Your nostrils are flaring.

363
00:16:09,957 --> 00:16:10,378
They are not.

364
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:11,340
You're into me.

365
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:11,879
I can tell.

366
00:16:12,981 --> 00:16:17,147
Dr. Small and Angry was a hot appetizer, but you, Doc, are a smorgasbord of lust.

367
00:16:17,246 --> 00:16:18,649
Mr. Doff, you're pressing your luck.

368
00:16:19,202 --> 00:16:20,124
Would you press it for me?

369
00:16:21,745 --> 00:16:22,846
I hope you're not claustrophobic.

370
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:27,091
You're staring at me.

371
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:27,812
Stop.

372
00:16:28,312 --> 00:16:30,474
I'm looking at you, sweetheart, but it's the strangest thing.

373
00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:32,976
I'm hungry for a chocolate cupcake.

374
00:16:33,777 --> 00:16:34,317
What did you say?

375
00:16:34,357 --> 00:16:35,879
A chocolate cupcake?

376
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,663
Maybe one of those fudgy things with the white squiggle on the frosting.

377
00:16:39,883 --> 00:16:40,403
Could you oblige?

378
00:16:42,846 --> 00:16:43,006
What?

379
00:16:43,826 --> 00:16:46,509
Do I still have some chocolate on my face or in my hair or something?

380
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:48,774
What are you talking about?

381
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:49,336
You.

382
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:50,840
I know the drill, so keep it up.

383
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:54,467
Next, you'll be reading my cards, telling me my dead uncle is in the room.

384
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:56,572
Is he?

385
00:16:57,335 --> 00:16:58,216
I don't have a dead uncle.

386
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,455
I'm watching you.

387
00:17:15,193 --> 00:17:16,682
If that's turkey, can I have some?

388
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,003
It's soggy.

389
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:18,432
It'll kill you to solve everything.

390
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:20,163
I could have gotten that intubation.

391
00:17:20,242 --> 00:17:21,811
I am good at intubations.

392
00:17:22,602 --> 00:17:25,424
Why does everything in a hospital smell like a hospital?

393
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,807
Don't be so hard on yourself, George.

394
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:27,606
Everybody makes mistakes.

395
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:28,788
You know, I'm good at a lot of things.

396
00:17:28,808 --> 00:17:29,128
You know what?

397
00:17:29,209 --> 00:17:30,009
I want to tell you something.

398
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:31,832
Hey, George, you need to get laid.

399
00:17:32,413 --> 00:17:33,173
See that nurse over there?

400
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:34,295
She's single.

401
00:17:34,835 --> 00:17:35,976
She's got red hair.

402
00:17:36,436 --> 00:17:37,258
Go ask her out.

403
00:17:37,278 --> 00:17:39,359
In case you forgot, I intubated an esophagus.

404
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,560
Dude, you're tweaking.

405
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:42,403
Maybe you should go see that psychic.

406
00:17:42,523 --> 00:17:44,125
Mr. Duff is not a psychic!

407
00:17:44,265 --> 00:17:45,626
I am trying to help you.

408
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,569
Go buy her a latte and freshen up your gonad.

409
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,171
Please.

410
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:51,292
Please.

411
00:17:55,693 --> 00:17:56,494
Shut up.

412
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,640
It's not too late to call her.

413
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,061
You know, moms like that.

414
00:18:01,642 --> 00:18:03,044
Surprises on their birthdays.

415
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:05,268
You know, it's very hallmark.

416
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,803
I'm 47, you know?

417
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:21,651
I'm 47 and having a baby, which is kind of a miracle, and it kind of sucks, if you see what I mean.

418
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:26,147
Would have actually given up on the whole kid thing about a year ago.

419
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,832
You know, fertility treatments, acupuncture needles in my eyes.

420
00:18:31,012 --> 00:18:33,055
Well, not really, but it felt like it.

421
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:34,556
I was like, screw this.

422
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:38,319
I want my life back.

423
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:42,163
Then one awesome night on the beach with a bottle of Merlot.

424
00:18:42,324 --> 00:18:44,066
I should have these labs back in a couple hours.

425
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:45,126
You get it, right?

426
00:18:46,288 --> 00:18:47,028
My hesitation.

427
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,632
This isn't an easy decision.

428
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:51,874
I mean, I'm having a baby.

429
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,131
You have advanced stage carcinoma.

430
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,855
You're 47 years old.

431
00:18:56,914 --> 00:19:00,020
So statistically, you have a good probability of survival.

432
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:01,223
Forgo treatment.

433
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:03,749
Chances are you won't see your baby go to kindergarten.

434
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:06,074
So whose life are you interested in saving?

435
00:19:06,114 --> 00:19:14,570
Excuse me.

436
00:19:27,105 --> 00:19:27,626
Where's my fingers?

437
00:19:28,188 --> 00:19:29,891
I can't.

438
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:30,692
Right here.

439
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:30,992
No?

440
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:38,027
Let me know if you feel this.

441
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:39,308
Anything here?

442
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:39,890
Up here?

443
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:40,571
OK.

444
00:19:40,592 --> 00:19:41,353
Nothing on this side?

445
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:43,457
All right, I'll be right back.

446
00:19:43,477 --> 00:19:44,940
Nurse, cancel the second MRI.

447
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,583
Call down and prep OR staff.

448
00:19:47,845 --> 00:19:48,645
You're operating?

449
00:19:49,406 --> 00:19:49,928
On what?

450
00:19:50,307 --> 00:19:52,090
If there was something to fix, wouldn't we have seen it?

451
00:19:52,111 --> 00:19:54,173
I think the MRI missed a clot somewhere in his upper spine.

452
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:55,615
I'm going to cut him open.

453
00:19:55,635 --> 00:19:56,056
I'm going in.

454
00:19:56,576 --> 00:19:57,357
What if you're wrong?

455
00:19:57,858 --> 00:20:00,382
Couldn't unnecessary spinal surgery do more damage?

456
00:20:00,422 --> 00:20:04,748
If we wait any longer and this thing expands into his brain stem, we have a paralyzed man who can't breathe.

457
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:05,729
I'm trusting my instincts.

458
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:07,811
Sometimes you've got to take a chance to save a life.

459
00:20:15,942 --> 00:20:22,796
Your mitral regurg is getting worse.

460
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,982
The valves are leakier than ever.

461
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:31,836
Are you hitting on me?

462
00:20:32,557 --> 00:20:33,157
You want me to?

463
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,824
I hear they call you Dr. Evilsbaum.

464
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:37,653
Only the people that like me.

465
00:20:38,494 --> 00:20:40,357
I guess that explains the lack of faith thing.

466
00:20:40,377 --> 00:20:45,926
Well, I kind of think of myself as a pagan, but, uh, hey, that's just me.

467
00:20:49,892 --> 00:20:51,815
You know what it's like being a teenager these days?

468
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:55,961
My friends spend most of their time screwing around and getting wasted.

469
00:20:56,001 --> 00:20:58,265
At least I have God.

470
00:20:58,404 --> 00:21:02,290
Well, so God wants you to die, huh?

471
00:21:03,413 --> 00:21:05,675
He wants me to be passionate about what I believe in.

472
00:21:06,954 --> 00:21:08,175
You don't believe in anything.

473
00:21:09,657 --> 00:21:10,920
No, my mother used to pray to St.

474
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,161
Jude for me.

475
00:21:12,181 --> 00:21:13,061
How appropriate.

476
00:21:14,183 --> 00:21:15,625
Patron saint of lost causes.

477
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:17,307
Oh.

478
00:21:20,971 --> 00:21:21,792
The fate of Kurt Cobain.

479
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,598
I did an angio on my side case.

480
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,102
The MRI came out clean, but I saw a digital.

481
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:29,942
There's something here.

482
00:21:31,464 --> 00:21:31,545
Yep.

483
00:21:32,182 --> 00:21:34,404
You're right, there's an AVM on his left temporal lobe.

484
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:36,086
I'll schedule the OR for tonight, then.

485
00:21:36,827 --> 00:21:37,689
Oh, back up, girl.

486
00:21:38,329 --> 00:21:40,071
There's high risk of spontaneous hemorrhage.

487
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:41,432
The attending has to see the films.

488
00:21:41,472 --> 00:21:42,574
We need consent forms.

489
00:21:42,894 --> 00:21:45,156
Believe it or not, Stevens, we have to follow protocol.

490
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:45,678
Take a breath.

491
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:48,220
But if the AVM looks like it's going to blow, we fix it, right?

492
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,364
If the man needs to be fixed, we'll fix him in due time.

493
00:21:51,403 --> 00:21:52,625
Why are you moving so quickly?

494
00:21:53,306 --> 00:21:56,648
You get too involved with your patients, Izzy.

495
00:21:56,669 --> 00:21:58,131
Why do you make everything so personal?

496
00:21:59,172 --> 00:22:00,012
It's not personal.

497
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:03,105
It's not.

498
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:09,894
I've got to save this cord.

499
00:22:10,757 --> 00:22:13,661
This guy is built like the rock of Gibraltar.

500
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:14,422
You want me to start?

501
00:22:14,942 --> 00:22:17,967
No, I'm going to cut here from the base of the neck to the rib cage.

502
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:20,430
I want you to hit the bleeders.

503
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:23,634
I still don't think we should be doing this.

504
00:22:25,237 --> 00:22:26,759
This guy has a spinal hematoma.

505
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:27,740
We don't know that.

506
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,963
Which left untreated are almost always fatal.

507
00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:30,944
You're cutting blind.

508
00:22:31,144 --> 00:22:32,666
Whatever happened to being practical?

509
00:22:33,127 --> 00:22:34,028
I need to see more here.

510
00:22:34,108 --> 00:22:34,990
Tractor.

511
00:22:37,813 --> 00:22:38,173
Wow.

512
00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:39,615
Good cap refill.

513
00:22:39,996 --> 00:22:40,717
The spine.

514
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:50,750
There is no wow in practical.

515
00:22:52,112 --> 00:22:54,013
We've decided to go ahead with the evacuation.

516
00:22:54,434 --> 00:22:57,818
What the hell, right?

517
00:22:57,838 --> 00:22:59,480
Maybe this is how it's supposed to be.

518
00:23:00,523 --> 00:23:02,047
We need to start chemo right away, then.

519
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:03,228
We'll get everything ready.

520
00:23:08,217 --> 00:23:09,499
You ever done a DNC before?

521
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,661
We learn at school.

522
00:23:11,461 --> 00:23:12,904
OK, go ahead.

523
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:15,910
I'll call an OP resident down to supervise.

524
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,992
If she needs anything, page me.

525
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:39,904
You're using up my oxygen, O'Malley.

526
00:23:39,924 --> 00:23:43,768
How does a pompous cocky jackass like you always have women all over him?

527
00:23:44,969 --> 00:23:45,890
Little blue love pills.

528
00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:48,231
Lots of them.

529
00:23:48,251 --> 00:23:50,294
Come on.

530
00:23:50,314 --> 00:23:52,335
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.

531
00:23:54,116 --> 00:23:54,537
There it is.

532
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:57,038
A bovine xenograft.

533
00:24:00,761 --> 00:24:02,503
O'Malley, you think too much.

534
00:24:02,923 --> 00:24:03,585
Can't you see it?

535
00:24:04,244 --> 00:24:05,486
You got to dance and jab.

536
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:07,268
Dance and jab.

537
00:24:07,535 --> 00:24:08,195
Like me.

538
00:24:08,817 --> 00:24:10,459
I am the Ali of this place.

539
00:24:13,282 --> 00:24:28,884
Does the wall ever bow back?

540
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:39,549
It's called davening, smartass.

541
00:24:40,352 --> 00:24:43,457
This is me communing with God, and you're interrupting.

542
00:24:44,117 --> 00:24:45,720
I've found a transplant option.

543
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:49,866
At first, I thought maybe a cadaver, but they're really hard to find.

544
00:24:50,647 --> 00:24:55,375
And then I realized Dr. Burke can transplant a bovine mitral valve instead of the pig.

545
00:24:55,955 --> 00:24:57,157
She can get a cow valve?

546
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,103
Dr. Burke, why wasn't this mentioned before?

547
00:25:00,943 --> 00:25:03,548
The divine valve has only been an option the last few years.

548
00:25:04,068 --> 00:25:05,691
And it's a much more complicated procedure.

549
00:25:05,711 --> 00:25:08,875
But the best part is it's actually superior to the pig.

550
00:25:08,895 --> 00:25:09,497
It lasts longer.

551
00:25:09,537 --> 00:25:14,565
What incredibly small fraction of your brain were you using there?

552
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:15,326
What?

553
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:20,273
Correct me if I'm wrong, but did you not present an alternative procedure without consulting your attending first?

554
00:25:20,574 --> 00:25:21,756
I thought you'd be... What, impressed?

555
00:25:22,477 --> 00:25:23,298
That's just stupid.

556
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,339
I'm sorry.

557
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:25,301
We're finished here, Karev.

558
00:25:25,842 --> 00:25:26,884
You're off this case.

559
00:25:42,405 --> 00:25:45,608
You need to sign these consent forms so we can proceed with your surgery.

560
00:25:46,368 --> 00:25:50,452
Sweetheart, I'm not signing anything unless it's got my name on it, followed by a whole bunch of zeros.

561
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:53,895
Look, the AVM is located in this crucial part of the brain.

562
00:25:53,955 --> 00:25:57,798
It's a tangle of blood vessels that could burst and affect your speech, among other things.

563
00:25:57,878 --> 00:26:00,161
So we know your visions are actually seizures.

564
00:26:00,402 --> 00:26:00,701
Do you?

565
00:26:01,001 --> 00:26:01,583
Do I what?

566
00:26:02,844 --> 00:26:03,624
Know they're seizures.

567
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:06,946
You're really good at reading people, aren't you?

568
00:26:07,627 --> 00:26:08,689
Telling them what they want to hear.

569
00:26:09,348 --> 00:26:12,311
There's a really unfortunate alignment of Saturn in the house of Jupiter right now.

570
00:26:13,979 --> 00:26:15,961
Okay, I know what you're doing.

571
00:26:16,821 --> 00:26:19,184
You watch people, read their body language.

572
00:26:19,605 --> 00:26:23,269
You say chocolate cupcakes, I lean towards you, so you think you're on the right track.

573
00:26:23,611 --> 00:26:25,933
Not only do you know you're having seizures, but you're milking it.

574
00:26:28,596 --> 00:26:31,480
Well, we'll just see about that, Cricket.

575
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:32,320
What?

576
00:26:34,003 --> 00:26:35,244
What did you just call me?

577
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:42,476
I'm going to do a quick pelvic exam.

578
00:26:42,675 --> 00:26:44,178
The OB resident should be down soon.

579
00:26:44,898 --> 00:26:45,701
It's a short procedure.

580
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:47,002
Your husband can stay if he likes.

581
00:26:47,584 --> 00:26:48,384
He changed our minds.

582
00:26:48,444 --> 00:26:49,266
Excuse me?

583
00:26:49,987 --> 00:26:51,189
We've decided to keep the baby.

584
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:53,874
You have cancer.

585
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:56,938
Can you tell me I'll survive if I go through with this?

586
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:02,026
Having the procedure does not necessarily improve the treatment outcome.

587
00:27:02,326 --> 00:27:04,009
You have quite the bedside manner.

588
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:04,911
You know that, right?

589
00:27:06,815 --> 00:27:09,978
My mom died of breast cancer when she was in her 40s.

590
00:27:10,598 --> 00:27:11,921
I have that cancer gene.

591
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:16,865
My chances are pretty much lose-lose, whichever way you look at it, except for the baby.

592
00:27:17,967 --> 00:27:18,587
We're keeping it.

593
00:27:21,351 --> 00:27:22,551
I'll call down a psych consult.

594
00:27:22,592 --> 00:27:23,133
Don't bother.

595
00:27:23,653 --> 00:27:28,259
I am going to get fat and happy instead of skinny and bald.

596
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:29,579
And at the end of it all.

597
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:32,383
Look, if you want to live, honey, that's what I'm doing.

598
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:49,641
Look, if you think you're gonna get any, think again.

599
00:27:50,942 --> 00:27:51,743
I'm not in the mood.

600
00:27:53,566 --> 00:27:54,467
I'm not in the mood either.

601
00:27:54,487 --> 00:27:54,807
Good.

602
00:28:00,494 --> 00:28:00,955
What do you want?

603
00:28:01,957 --> 00:28:02,238
Nothing.

604
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:03,839
I just haven't seen you all day.

605
00:28:07,684 --> 00:28:13,051
So I'm working.

606
00:28:15,412 --> 00:28:17,335
I've never done a bovine replacement before.

607
00:28:17,355 --> 00:28:19,557
I don't know what I'm doing.

608
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:25,065
Look it up, research it, and get someone to assist you.

609
00:28:27,828 --> 00:28:28,770
It's not that easy.

610
00:28:29,451 --> 00:28:31,855
This is a problem that has a solution, Burke.

611
00:28:32,154 --> 00:28:33,376
There are a lot of problems that don't.

612
00:28:40,026 --> 00:28:41,728
Third thoracic laminae, nothing.

613
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,012
I think I see the dura pulsating here.

614
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:46,167
No, it's not.

615
00:28:46,868 --> 00:28:47,269
Keep looking.

616
00:28:47,349 --> 00:28:48,951
We've been at this for four hours.

617
00:28:49,192 --> 00:28:52,036
Maybe he just injured his spinal cord, and there's nothing to fix.

618
00:28:52,196 --> 00:28:55,480
Gray, when you read your books, make sure you reference them correctly.

619
00:28:55,741 --> 00:28:58,285
Progressive paralysis implies a pressure lesion.

620
00:28:58,746 --> 00:28:59,788
My books got me here.

621
00:29:01,951 --> 00:29:04,314
Pressure's up to 180 over 111.

622
00:29:04,654 --> 00:29:05,476
Pulse is in the 40s.

623
00:29:05,615 --> 00:29:06,057
What is it?

624
00:29:06,237 --> 00:29:08,180
I'm pushing 70 milligrams of disoxide.

625
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:08,700
OK.

626
00:29:09,602 --> 00:29:10,803
Autonomic dysreflexia.

627
00:29:10,824 --> 00:29:12,286
Damage to the sympathetic nervous system?

628
00:29:12,306 --> 00:29:14,628
The CP in the heart rate are unstable.

629
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,602
We're in trouble, aren't we?

630
00:29:15,722 --> 00:29:16,763
We've got to find the clot.

631
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:21,191
Now, I can see the cord below the door.

632
00:29:21,211 --> 00:29:22,093
Is he going to stroke out?

633
00:29:22,153 --> 00:29:23,114
Just focus, Gray.

634
00:29:23,134 --> 00:29:24,135
We're going to find the clot.

635
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:24,656
It's there.

636
00:29:25,337 --> 00:29:26,239
Peanut, please.

637
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:27,740
Okay.

638
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,462
BP is still up.

639
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:29,624
Heart rate's at 44.

640
00:29:30,945 --> 00:29:31,728
Get on those bleeders.

641
00:29:36,335 --> 00:29:37,696
Keep looking, Dr. Gray.

642
00:29:43,819 --> 00:29:45,942
Dr. O'Malley, our patient's pulse ox is dropping.

643
00:29:45,962 --> 00:29:46,423
She's agonal.

644
00:29:46,442 --> 00:29:47,124
She needs to be intubated.

645
00:29:48,345 --> 00:29:49,666
Isn't there anyone else who can do this?

646
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,068
You're standing right here.

647
00:29:51,088 --> 00:29:52,269
I could try and find someone.

648
00:29:52,711 --> 00:29:54,673
No, that's... I got it.

649
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:02,522
Okay.

650
00:30:03,683 --> 00:30:04,925
So that's down to 86%.

651
00:30:04,945 --> 00:30:09,411
Crank pressure, please.

652
00:30:09,431 --> 00:30:09,530
Okay.

653
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,531
I see cords.

654
00:30:10,551 --> 00:30:11,093
Two, three.

655
00:30:31,626 --> 00:30:33,048
Clear and equal.

656
00:30:33,068 --> 00:30:34,309
CO2 detector mellow yellow.

657
00:30:36,112 --> 00:30:37,334
Smooth moves, doctor.

658
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:38,836
Kicked ass.

659
00:30:52,992 --> 00:30:53,953
Ah, Dr. Karev.

660
00:30:55,496 --> 00:30:58,278
How long did it take to get a car valve?

661
00:30:58,298 --> 00:31:00,402
Oh, about 60 minutes by messenger.

662
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:04,208
You're scrubbing in.

663
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,211
Thank you very much, sir.

664
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,832
This doesn't get you any points, Karev.

665
00:31:09,532 --> 00:31:11,153
I'm the only one with points around here, OK?

666
00:31:14,396 --> 00:31:18,040
Oh, by the way, Devo wants a rabbi to bless her before surgery.

667
00:31:19,221 --> 00:31:19,622
Seriously?

668
00:31:20,182 --> 00:31:21,104
You came up with the call.

669
00:31:21,683 --> 00:31:22,765
You can find that girl a rabbi.

670
00:31:26,689 --> 00:31:29,372
For the irrigation and suction, have it ready.

671
00:31:29,392 --> 00:31:29,612
Right away.

672
00:31:32,494 --> 00:31:33,957
What is it?

673
00:31:34,196 --> 00:31:34,798
See for yourself.

674
00:31:35,798 --> 00:31:39,022
Second thoracic vertebrae.

675
00:31:39,103 --> 00:31:42,527
Oh, my God.

676
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:44,147
I see it.

677
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,028
It really is there.

678
00:31:45,068 --> 00:31:46,070
Of course it is.

679
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:51,636
Let's suction and pack this baby, shall we?

680
00:31:51,656 --> 00:31:55,121
Here you go.

681
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,163
Dr. Burke to oncology.

682
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:57,784
You were right.

683
00:31:58,305 --> 00:31:59,526
Dr. Burke to oncology.

684
00:31:59,546 --> 00:32:00,666
Is he gonna be okay?

685
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:01,167
I think so.

686
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:02,550
But you don't know that.

687
00:32:02,951 --> 00:32:05,673
I know we stopped the paralysis from advancing.

688
00:32:05,693 --> 00:32:08,576
But you don't know if the paralysis he already has will be permanent?

689
00:32:08,596 --> 00:32:08,656
No.

690
00:32:09,938 --> 00:32:11,940
You know, you keep taking everything on faith.

691
00:32:13,362 --> 00:32:14,883
How do you know what's real and what's not?

692
00:32:15,503 --> 00:32:15,983
We just do.

693
00:32:19,248 --> 00:32:20,990
You know, some people would call this a relationship.

694
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,712
The kind where you exchange keys, leave your toothbrush over.

695
00:32:25,473 --> 00:32:25,733
Who?

696
00:32:26,434 --> 00:32:27,415
Who would call it that?

697
00:32:28,596 --> 00:32:28,798
Me.

698
00:32:30,859 --> 00:32:31,240
I would.

699
00:32:33,801 --> 00:32:35,182
And I'm supposed to believe you.

700
00:32:35,383 --> 00:32:35,604
Uh-huh.

701
00:32:36,684 --> 00:32:37,484
Show me something.

702
00:32:39,946 --> 00:32:41,209
Give me a reason to believe.

703
00:32:48,194 --> 00:32:56,442
I have your discharge papers.

704
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,605
Oh, you're not happy with me, are you?

705
00:33:00,425 --> 00:33:00,986
I'm your doctor.

706
00:33:01,006 --> 00:33:02,086
It's not my place to be happy.

707
00:33:02,557 --> 00:33:06,404
My husband and child are going to be together long after I'm gone.

708
00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:07,487
We've talked about it.

709
00:33:07,507 --> 00:33:10,272
It's our decision, and that's OK.

710
00:33:10,934 --> 00:33:11,936
So why do you need my approval?

711
00:33:11,977 --> 00:33:13,559
I just want you to understand.

712
00:33:14,442 --> 00:33:14,962
Well, I don't.

713
00:33:30,265 --> 00:33:31,567
I brought the consent forms again.

714
00:33:32,228 --> 00:33:33,490
You really need to sign them.

715
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:35,714
Your surgeon scheduled the OR.

716
00:33:36,316 --> 00:33:39,622
Mr. Duff, are you all right?

717
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:40,743
Are you having another seizure?

718
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:46,334
Yeah.

719
00:33:46,354 --> 00:33:46,994
Yeah.

720
00:33:47,015 --> 00:33:47,776
I think maybe I am.

721
00:33:50,922 --> 00:33:51,682
What is it?

722
00:33:57,349 --> 00:34:01,355
It's me.

723
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:04,721
I think it's about to be over.

724
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,222
We know what we're doing, Mr. Duff.

725
00:34:07,124 --> 00:34:08,365
You saw the angio results.

726
00:34:08,485 --> 00:34:10,188
We're catching the AVM just in time.

727
00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:11,251
You don't need to be nervous.

728
00:34:11,831 --> 00:34:12,592
You're not gonna die.

729
00:34:14,014 --> 00:34:15,135
I'm not talking about dying.

730
00:34:22,547 --> 00:34:24,369
My whole life has been about what I see.

731
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:27,596
and about believing in myself, whatever people think.

732
00:34:28,476 --> 00:34:30,300
And you're telling me there's a very good chance that will go away?

733
00:34:32,523 --> 00:34:33,545
Look, you're a healthy guy.

734
00:34:33,585 --> 00:34:36,009
You're going to live a long, full life.

735
00:34:37,711 --> 00:34:41,818
And if your psychic visions are real, you've got to believe you'll have them when you come out.

736
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:30,333
Meesha, Beirach, Avotenu, Avraham, Yitzchak, V'Yakob, V'imotenu, Sarah, Rivka, Rachel, B'Leah, Hu Yivarech, V'Yirapet, Acholah,

737
00:35:46,327 --> 00:35:48,730
This is Dr. Chesney from the Cleveland Clinic.

738
00:35:49,271 --> 00:35:53,094
He's an expert on bovine valve replacement surgery.

739
00:35:53,114 --> 00:35:55,096
He will be assisting via satellite.

740
00:35:57,137 --> 00:35:58,679
Thank you, doctor.

741
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:15,894
After the sternotomy and connection to bypass, we're going to do a transverse left atrial to expose the valve.

742
00:36:15,914 --> 00:36:16,014
Good.

743
00:36:19,184 --> 00:36:21,887
I tried to talk Shepard out of that clot surgery.

744
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:24,048
What is wrong with me?

745
00:36:24,469 --> 00:36:26,070
Basically, you tried to kill the guy.

746
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,771
Basically, you're an ass.

747
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:28,893
Oh, you know you want it.

748
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:30,335
Come to Poppy, baby.

749
00:36:32,016 --> 00:36:33,418
This is George.

750
00:36:33,498 --> 00:36:38,081
George has a hot date.

751
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:39,282
Oh, that's great, George.

752
00:36:40,905 --> 00:36:41,284
Yeah.

753
00:36:42,425 --> 00:36:44,168
Well, left pocket of my lab coat, Georgie.

754
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:46,170
No glove, no love.

755
00:36:53,304 --> 00:37:00,494
My psychic had a surgery.

756
00:37:01,936 --> 00:37:02,255
Yeah?

757
00:37:03,557 --> 00:37:06,041
I wonder what happened with his gift.

758
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,163
Come on, we all know he's crazy.

759
00:37:08,182 --> 00:37:14,510
I thought you said you didn't believe in that stuff.

760
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:19,077
I grew up in a trailer park, no way to tables, which was supposed to put me through college, but...

761
00:37:20,052 --> 00:37:24,496
My mother was always calling these psychics all the time.

762
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,262
And the bills started piling up, so I had to use my money to pay them.

763
00:37:30,284 --> 00:37:32,246
When I turned 18, I left and never went back.

764
00:37:33,407 --> 00:37:37,472
But this guy has been saying things to me, things he couldn't possibly know anything about.

765
00:37:39,635 --> 00:37:41,657
So I just wonder.

766
00:37:46,003 --> 00:37:47,864
Do you have sensation anywhere else?

767
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:50,882
Some feeling in my stomach and feet, I guess.

768
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:52,103
Bladder and bowels?

769
00:37:52,885 --> 00:37:53,766
Not so good still.

770
00:37:54,246 --> 00:37:56,829
They said the pressure stockings help relieve clots and bed sores.

771
00:37:56,909 --> 00:38:09,063
They do.

772
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:14,048
I want to thank you for everything, believing in me that I wasn't making it up.

773
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:18,273
Well, I'll come back tomorrow then.

774
00:38:18,675 --> 00:38:19,976
Hey, I wanted to show you something.

775
00:38:20,338 --> 00:38:27,644
I wasn't sure it would last, but now, look.

776
00:38:27,664 --> 00:38:30,628
I know it's hardly anything, but... No, it's something.

777
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,152
It's something really big.

778
00:38:39,978 --> 00:38:44,262
At the end of the day, faith is a funny thing.

779
00:38:46,822 --> 00:38:48,965
It turns up when you don't really expect it.

780
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:52,630
Mr. Duff, you're still with us.

781
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:56,474
For your recipe.

782
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:02,280
One tablespoon coconut extract.

783
00:39:05,284 --> 00:39:12,172
It's like one day you realize that the fairy tale may be slightly different than you dreamed.

784
00:39:14,565 --> 00:39:27,422
Where are we going?

785
00:39:27,443 --> 00:39:32,148
Trust me.

786
00:39:32,168 --> 00:39:42,041
The castle, well, it may not be a castle.

787
00:39:45,632 --> 00:39:54,405
Does it beat?

788
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,708
Or move.

789
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,371
And it's not so important that it's happy ever after.

790
00:40:02,215 --> 00:40:03,978
Just that it's happy right now.

791
00:40:06,942 --> 00:40:12,349
This love is all I have to give.

792
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:23,701
Mom, it's me.

793
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:24,782
Cricket.

794
00:40:24,802 --> 00:40:29,550
See, once in a while, once in a blue moon, people will surprise you.

795
00:40:29,951 --> 00:40:35,460
I've been thinking about you a lot, too.

796
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,804
Where are we?

797
00:40:37,824 --> 00:40:38,103
Shh, shh, shh.

798
00:40:38,123 --> 00:40:38,505
I'm gonna tell you.

799
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,891
All right, my mother's maiden name, Maloney.

800
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:43,692
I have four sisters.

801
00:40:43,711 --> 00:40:48,516
I have nine nieces, five nephews.

802
00:40:48,536 --> 00:40:53,822
I like coffee ice cream, single malt scotch, occasionally good cigar, like the fly fish.

803
00:40:55,003 --> 00:40:56,625
And I cheat when I do the crossword puzzle on Sunday.

804
00:40:57,465 --> 00:41:01,048
And I never dance in public.

805
00:41:01,068 --> 00:41:02,690
Favorite novel, Sun Also Rises.

806
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,893
Favorite band, The Clash.

807
00:41:04,913 --> 00:41:05,594
Favorite color is blue.

808
00:41:05,653 --> 00:41:07,074
I don't like light, indigo.

809
00:41:08,152 --> 00:41:13,039
The scar right here on my forehead, that's why I don't ride motorcycles anymore.

810
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:14,019
And I live in that trailer.

811
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,286
All this land is mine.

812
00:41:20,148 --> 00:41:21,389
I have no idea what I'm gonna do with it.

813
00:41:22,891 --> 00:41:23,353
So that's it.

814
00:41:24,193 --> 00:41:25,135
That's all you've earned for now.

815
00:41:26,197 --> 00:41:30,041
The rest you're just... just gonna have to take on fate.

816
00:41:35,523 --> 00:41:48,485
And once in a while, people may even take your breath away.
