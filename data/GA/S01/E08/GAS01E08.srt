1
00:00:04,108 --> 00:00:07,624
You know how when you were a little
kid and you believed in fairy tales?

2
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:14,065
That fantasy of what your life would be -

3
00:00:15,044 --> 00:00:20,025
white dress, prince charming, who'd
carry you away to a castle on a hill.

4
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:24,090
You'd lie in bed at night and close your eyes,

5
00:00:24,161 --> 00:00:26,917
and you had complete and utter faith.

6
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:32,959
8 hours, 16 ounces of chocolate, and 32 cupcakes,

7
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,489
and they still don't taste right.

8
00:00:34,685 --> 00:00:36,338
No, these are good.

9
00:00:36,496 --> 00:00:38,253
Martha Stewart would be proud.

10
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:39,538
Yeah, look where it got her.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,720
Santa Claus, the tooth fairy, prince charming -

12
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,150
they were so close, you could taste them.

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,890
There's something missing -
some specific ingredient.

14
00:00:48,954 --> 00:00:50,095
Why can't I remember?

15
00:00:50,202 --> 00:00:52,275
But eventually you grow up.

16
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,510
One day you open your eyes,

17
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:56,644
and the fairy tale disappears.

18
00:00:56,731 --> 00:00:57,626
Look, just call her.

19
00:00:57,754 --> 00:00:58,937
Call your mother and ask.

20
00:00:59,055 --> 00:01:02,225
Most people turn to the things
and people they can trust.

21
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:03,576
I don't want to call my mother.

22
00:01:07,298 --> 00:01:09,228
So, let's go sleep at your house tonight.

23
00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:10,585
What?

24
00:01:10,652 --> 00:01:12,674
Why are we always sleeping at my house?

25
00:01:13,022 --> 00:01:14,088
Do you even have one?

26
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:14,953
One what?

27
00:01:15,111 --> 00:01:15,952
A house.

28
00:01:16,145 --> 00:01:17,021
With a closet.

29
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:18,891
With your stuff in it.

30
00:01:19,683 --> 00:01:20,836
Your personal stuff.

31
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:22,977
Do you even have one of those?

32
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:27,359
Good morning.

33
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:29,473
Hey. You guys want a cupcake?

34
00:01:29,783 --> 00:01:30,671
Izzie made 'em.

35
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:32,909
You know, I like it here.

36
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:35,895
Hey, you said so yourself - you
liked having your things around,

37
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,991
sleeping in your own bed.

38
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:39,805
You're like a health nut, aren't you?

39
00:01:40,415 --> 00:01:42,044
You eat muesli every morning.

40
00:01:44,262 --> 00:01:45,126
No, I don't.

41
00:01:46,053 --> 00:01:48,182
Okay, the muesli thing - you do.

42
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:50,614
- The last 7 days, at least.
- Oh, come on.

43
00:01:51,597 --> 00:01:53,517
I haven't been here for a whole week...

44
00:01:55,396 --> 00:01:56,170
Have I?

45
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:57,578
See?

46
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,871
Even they think it's weird.

47
00:02:00,122 --> 00:02:05,487
But the thing is, it's hard to let
go of that fairy tale entirely.

48
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,439
Almost everyone still has that
smallest bit of hope - of faith -

49
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:12,861
that one day they'll open their eyes

50
00:02:13,953 --> 00:02:15,676
and it will all come true.

51
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:27,028
So, I've checked the schedule.

52
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,559
I start E.N.T. on the 9th.

53
00:02:28,657 --> 00:02:30,754
It's a light rotation. Can you get me in then?

54
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:32,681
Oh, I'm afraid not.

55
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:35,629
We have openings on the 16th.

56
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:40,648
There are other options besides
termination, you know?

57
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:41,820
Adoption...

58
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:43,934
keeping the baby.

59
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:49,347
- You think it over. Call me back.
- Put me down for the 16th.

60
00:02:49,455 --> 00:02:51,502
I'll confirm after I rearrange my schedule.

61
00:02:52,552 --> 00:02:55,597
- I know this is a difficult decision.
- Okay, you know the talking part?

62
00:02:56,872 --> 00:02:58,169
I'm not interested.

63
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,544
So, Devo, you just had a root canal, correct?

64
00:03:03,805 --> 00:03:04,415
Yeah.

65
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:07,037
I couldn't stop bleeding after - literally.

66
00:03:07,164 --> 00:03:08,398
Now I'm stuck with you guys.

67
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:10,615
Give me the bullet.

68
00:03:10,918 --> 00:03:15,085
17-year-old female hospitalized for
excessive bleeding, status post root canal.

69
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,994
Also had a significant new heart
murmur associated with fever.

70
00:03:18,085 --> 00:03:19,631
Now afebrile on antibiotics.

71
00:03:20,688 --> 00:03:22,396
If I'm gonna die, can you page my mom and dad?

72
00:03:22,462 --> 00:03:23,277
You're not dying.

73
00:03:23,456 --> 00:03:24,439
Where are your parents?

74
00:03:24,562 --> 00:03:25,519
In the cafeteria.

75
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:27,685
My freak father likes hospital food.

76
00:03:28,018 --> 00:03:31,367
You're in excellent hands here.
Dr. Karev is gonna run some labs.

77
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:34,540
And I'll see you with your
parents in a little while.

78
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,199
Add a bleeding time to the coags.

79
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:42,507
So, what kind of name is "Devo," anyway?

80
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:43,742
'80s rocker.

81
00:03:43,982 --> 00:03:45,425
My parents did too much blow.

82
00:03:46,251 --> 00:03:47,623
I call myself "Esther."

83
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,572
Nice skirt, Esther. What are you, amish?

84
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:53,460
Haven't you ever seen an orthodox jew?

85
00:03:57,326 --> 00:04:00,275
This guy belongs in psych. What
are you doing turfing him here?

86
00:04:00,454 --> 00:04:04,099
He's my gift to you. Had a seizure two
days ago and another one this morning.

87
00:04:04,186 --> 00:04:06,182
What are you talking about? It says right here,

88
00:04:06,254 --> 00:04:10,502
"he talks to dead people, his family thinks
he's dangerous, and they had him committed."

89
00:04:10,602 --> 00:04:12,173
That's psych, not neuro.

90
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:13,812
Didn't you go to med school?

91
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,791
Yes, unlike the correspondence
school you attended.

92
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,323
Oh, that would be Stanford, right?

93
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:20,513
I learned not to jump to conclusions.

94
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:23,116
Sorry, ladies. We can't take
him back until he's cleared.

95
00:04:23,238 --> 00:04:24,564
You're dumping him on us?

96
00:04:24,836 --> 00:04:26,874
He thinks his seizures are visions.

97
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,305
Hello! They're not seizures. I'm psychic.

98
00:04:29,413 --> 00:04:31,122
Of course you are, and I'm a chicken.

99
00:04:31,565 --> 00:04:32,905
Hey, genius.

100
00:04:36,095 --> 00:04:39,058
Okay, Mr. Duff. We're gonna start our work-up now.

101
00:04:39,135 --> 00:04:41,726
Work me up, work me down. I'm
telling you, it's a waste of time.

102
00:04:41,809 --> 00:04:43,897
Can you grip my fingers, please?

103
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:52,709
Cristina...

104
00:04:53,518 --> 00:04:54,342
Mr. Duff?

105
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:55,781
Mr. Duff, are you okay?

106
00:05:00,087 --> 00:05:00,831
Someone...

107
00:05:01,638 --> 00:05:02,459
Someone what?

108
00:05:04,035 --> 00:05:05,268
Someone's gonna check out.

109
00:05:06,504 --> 00:05:07,224
Bye-bye.

110
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:08,460
The man - he's nuts.

111
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:12,372
I'm dizzy, not deaf, lady. Someone
on the fourth floor is gonna die.

112
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:14,024
Code blue, fourth floor.

113
00:05:14,136 --> 00:05:15,376
Code blue, fourth floor.

114
00:05:16,364 --> 00:05:17,044
Got a code.

115
00:05:17,624 --> 00:05:18,382
Right away.

116
00:05:18,648 --> 00:05:19,283
Get it.

117
00:06:06,068 --> 00:06:09,411
Fourth floor, dead guy. The psychic
predicted the fourth-floor dead guy.

118
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:12,766
I need someone to cover me on the 16th. You in?

119
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:15,899
I'm thinking about letting my hair grow.

120
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:19,198
And maybe I won't shave -
go for the stubble effect.

121
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:20,468
What do you think?

122
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:23,729
The 16th, George. Can you cover me or not?

123
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,540
Uh, yeah. I guess. Why?

124
00:06:26,852 --> 00:06:27,835
It's none of your business.

125
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:32,140
A "thank you" would be nice.

126
00:06:32,243 --> 00:06:34,823
It's just that I hardly know anything about you.

127
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:37,060
I'm from New York. I like ferry boats.

128
00:06:37,137 --> 00:06:39,575
Enough with the ferry boats.
What about your friends?

129
00:06:39,657 --> 00:06:41,040
I'm a surgeon. I don't have friends.

130
00:06:41,122 --> 00:06:42,473
Everybody has friends.

131
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,859
I mean, who do you hang out with?

132
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,631
What do you do on your days off?

133
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:49,427
- These are important questions.
- Ah, important for who?

134
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:52,492
We're having sex every night.
I think I deserve details.

135
00:06:52,554 --> 00:06:56,057
- You have more details than most.
- This is going somewhere weird.

136
00:06:56,308 --> 00:06:59,744
I want facts, and until I get
them, my pants are staying on.

137
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,602
Or you could just roll with it.

138
00:07:02,135 --> 00:07:04,224
Be flexible. See what happens.

139
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,385
I'm not flexible.

140
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,027
There I disagree.

141
00:07:08,213 --> 00:07:09,677
Hmm. I got to go.

142
00:07:13,676 --> 00:07:14,965
We'll find these things out.

143
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,379
That's the fun part, you know?

144
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,310
That's the gravy.

145
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,280
That is what I'm talking about.

146
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,190
I don't want to be your gravy.

147
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,022
Your daughter needs a valve replacement.

148
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:30,387
Tests are indicative of von willebrand's disease,

149
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:33,173
which explains the excessive
bleeding after the root canal.

150
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:34,386
And that means?

151
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:38,093
Devo can't take the blood thinners necessary
to maintain a mechanical heart valve.

152
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:40,386
We're suggesting a porcine valve instead.

153
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:41,508
Porcine?

154
00:07:42,096 --> 00:07:43,228
As in pig?

155
00:07:43,392 --> 00:07:45,747
It's the standard of care for
someone in this situation.

156
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,831
Pig, huh?

157
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:50,274
It's the other white meat.

158
00:07:50,913 --> 00:07:53,464
I don't care what you do. Save my daughter's life.

159
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:04,046
I'm removing the lump now.

160
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,713
Someone said you guys have a psychic
running around here. Is that true?

161
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,858
I did not even hear you say that.

162
00:08:09,945 --> 00:08:12,054
Predicted someone would die on the fourth floor.

163
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:14,384
I.C.U.'s on the fourth floor.
People die all the time.

164
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:17,758
Okay. We're finishing up here, Mrs. Glass.

165
00:08:17,912 --> 00:08:22,262
We'll take this down to path and get the
results of the frozen-section biopsy

166
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:24,403
and see you in a few hours.

167
00:08:24,526 --> 00:08:26,492
Seriously, the guy is just playing mind games.

168
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,719
I can see further into the future than he can.

169
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:31,157
Why do you even care about this, Stevens?

170
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:32,201
I don't.

171
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:37,137
Okay, Mr. Walker. Does that hurt?

172
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,150
I can't feel anything until you get to my thigh.

173
00:08:41,094 --> 00:08:42,289
Try wiggling your toes.

174
00:08:45,088 --> 00:08:45,913
Are they moving?

175
00:08:47,132 --> 00:08:48,267
- No.
- Damn.

176
00:08:48,932 --> 00:08:50,285
I could about 10 minutes ago.

177
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:53,562
Well, your spine x-rays look clear.

178
00:08:53,726 --> 00:08:54,782
You fell rock-climbing?

179
00:08:54,888 --> 00:08:57,376
In snohomish. Just a small drop. I was belayed.

180
00:08:59,111 --> 00:09:00,423
My wife and boys are on the way.

181
00:09:01,344 --> 00:09:02,481
What's wrong with me, anyway?

182
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,500
Hold your legs up.

183
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:10,607
- Should I be scared now?
- Just try and relax.

184
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,735
Nurse, I need a stat M.R.I.

185
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:15,338
Send an intern with him.

186
00:09:16,386 --> 00:09:17,499
Make it Meredith Grey.

187
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:22,669
Ew - thick, short neck. That isn't good.

188
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:24,211
It's hard to intubate. You want me to do that?

189
00:09:24,303 --> 00:09:26,141
He's my patient. I'm fine.

190
00:09:26,263 --> 00:09:28,993
I just can't see anything. Add suction.

191
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:32,684
Don't break any teeth.

192
00:09:32,771 --> 00:09:34,257
Don't you think I know that?

193
00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:39,734
Pulse ox down 87%.

194
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:40,826
Bag him.

195
00:09:42,647 --> 00:09:43,984
Are you sure you don't want me to do that?

196
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:45,607
No, damn it! Tube.

197
00:09:51,853 --> 00:09:52,535
There.

198
00:09:53,054 --> 00:09:54,255
Huh. Got it.

199
00:09:58,944 --> 00:10:00,055
It's in the esophagus.

200
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:02,089
Don't you know an esophagus from a trachea?

201
00:10:02,176 --> 00:10:04,300
Damn it! Anatomy is all messed up in here.

202
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,060
Are you trying to kill this patient, O'Malley?

203
00:10:08,478 --> 00:10:10,638
Maybe we can send you back
to practice on mannequins.

204
00:10:10,752 --> 00:10:13,055
No, it's just I haven't done that much -

205
00:10:14,074 --> 00:10:16,936
but when I have, it's - it's been good.

206
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:20,935
It's just I-I haven't -

207
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,246
Let's review the concepts.

208
00:10:23,486 --> 00:10:24,774
Never take your eyes away.

209
00:10:25,977 --> 00:10:28,329
Always - always - know you can follow through.

210
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:31,841
Don't ever follow through on
one of my patients, O'Malley.

211
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:47,437
Botox would do wonders for all those frown lines.

212
00:10:47,873 --> 00:10:50,084
Okay. Shut up.

213
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:51,578
Are you allowed to talk to me like that?

214
00:10:52,757 --> 00:10:56,221
God, you're hot... in a
Mrs. Livingston kind of way.

215
00:10:56,372 --> 00:10:57,078
See here?

216
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,698
These are spikes in your temporal lobe.

217
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:03,879
It means you have epilepsy. Not visions. Seizures.

218
00:11:03,985 --> 00:11:05,097
You think I'm epileptic?

219
00:11:05,256 --> 00:11:06,684
That is so not right.

220
00:11:07,073 --> 00:11:09,659
I'm gonna order an M.R.I. so I can
take a closer look at your brain.

221
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:10,800
Yeah, there's no way -

222
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:16,975
Mr. Duff?

223
00:11:17,831 --> 00:11:19,735
Mr. Duff, can you see me? Can you hear me?

224
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,465
Stay with me.

225
00:11:21,826 --> 00:11:24,890
I wouldn't have picked you for
the mommy track, nurse Betty.

226
00:11:29,707 --> 00:11:30,395
See?

227
00:11:33,534 --> 00:11:34,700
I told you I know things.

228
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:38,509
This pregnancy thing - you can't run away from it.

229
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:50,506
Dr. Bailey, I want off the psychic case.
I'll take whatever you got.

230
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:51,345
Can I switch?

231
00:11:51,455 --> 00:11:52,375
Ask nicely.

232
00:11:53,096 --> 00:11:55,072
Uh, well, this is me doing nicely.

233
00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:57,951
Look, I know the type.

234
00:11:58,038 --> 00:12:00,926
These guys want everybody to think
they're a sideshow. Let me take him.

235
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:02,416
I don't do switches.

236
00:12:02,497 --> 00:12:04,325
I'll do your post-op notes for a month.

237
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:07,827
Fine. I can accept that.

238
00:12:08,232 --> 00:12:09,784
Izzie, you get psych guy.

239
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,718
Yay. This is your lucky day.

240
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:13,777
You get to be with me on the breast cancer.

241
00:12:13,883 --> 00:12:16,824
There's spotting. You'll need to do a pelvic.
She's pregnant.

242
00:12:28,626 --> 00:12:32,183
See? This. The guy's films are clear.

243
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,679
There's no reason I can see
for his creeping paralysis.

244
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:37,063
It's just so surprising.

245
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,106
I expected an intrusion into the spinal space
or a bony spur in the nucleus pulposus.

246
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:43,243
Well, you were wrong.

247
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,372
You don't always get what you expect, do you?

248
00:12:47,713 --> 00:12:49,340
What is your problem?

249
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:51,220
Give me something to go on.

250
00:12:51,328 --> 00:12:52,110
Anything.

251
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:54,020
What are your grandparents' names?

252
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,136
I don't have grandparents.

253
00:12:55,228 --> 00:12:56,064
Where'd you grow up?

254
00:12:56,437 --> 00:12:58,214
What's your favorite flavor of ice cream?

255
00:12:58,336 --> 00:13:00,037
Where'd you spend your summer vacations?

256
00:13:00,124 --> 00:13:02,217
Lighten up - it'll be good
for your blood pressure.

257
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,624
Oh, don't you tell me to lighten up.

258
00:13:04,982 --> 00:13:08,583
I'll lighten up when I... feel light.

259
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:12,780
Don't we have treatment options?

260
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:14,823
I-I mean, aren't there always alternatives?

261
00:13:14,997 --> 00:13:17,480
With this stage of invasive carcinoma,

262
00:13:17,609 --> 00:13:21,377
surgery, chemo, radiation, and drug
therapy are your only options.

263
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:23,236
Can I wait until the end of my pregnancy?

264
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:26,661
The pregnancy hormones will likely
speed the growth of the cancer.

265
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,951
And the baby?

266
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,386
None of these courses of treatment
will allow the baby to survive.

267
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:36,620
Mr. and Mrs. Glass, I understand
how difficult this is.

268
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:39,112
No disrespect, but like hell you do.

269
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:44,403
You're going to have to make a decision
as to how you want to proceed.

270
00:13:44,518 --> 00:13:46,199
You mean my baby's life or my own?

271
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:49,977
Yes.

272
00:13:56,608 --> 00:13:58,293
We'll have to evacuate the fetus.

273
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:07,862
Any changes, Mr. Walker?

274
00:14:07,985 --> 00:14:09,608
I can't move my legs at all now.

275
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:11,907
He was moving his legs when he came in.

276
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:12,859
What's wrong with him?

277
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:13,893
I don't know.

278
00:14:14,744 --> 00:14:18,715
The paralysis is moving quickly, and there
was nothing in the M.R.I. to explain it.

279
00:14:18,962 --> 00:14:20,862
Has tommy been under any stress lately?

280
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:23,775
You know what's making me stressed? Being
in here and not being able to move.

281
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,551
Dr. Grey...

282
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:30,246
Emotional trauma can be converted
into something physical, right?

283
00:14:30,334 --> 00:14:31,542
- This is possible.
- Okay.

284
00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:33,497
Like hysterical numbness or paralysis.

285
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,547
Maybe there is no physiological reason,

286
00:14:35,638 --> 00:14:37,328
and he's just having a conversion reaction.

287
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,500
It's psychosomatic?

288
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,646
It is not in your head, man.

289
00:14:40,774 --> 00:14:42,489
- I believe you.
- Mr. Duff, please.

290
00:14:45,854 --> 00:14:46,643
Who was that?

291
00:14:47,027 --> 00:14:49,248
Psych sent him down. He has visions.

292
00:14:49,365 --> 00:14:50,210
Is that it?

293
00:14:50,605 --> 00:14:51,470
Am I crazy?

294
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,385
No. No.

295
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,226
I'm gonna order a higher-level M.R.I.

296
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,444
We're gonna figure this out.

297
00:15:03,957 --> 00:15:05,739
You know how important this is to me!

298
00:15:05,831 --> 00:15:07,440
This is about saving your life.

299
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:09,999
You're not respecting it - or me.

300
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,921
You're letting them put a pig - a
freaking nonkosher, traif mammal -

301
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,548
into my chest - into my heart -

302
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:18,391
the very essence of my being!

303
00:15:18,488 --> 00:15:20,184
It's a porcine valve, actually.

304
00:15:20,276 --> 00:15:21,965
I don't care what the hell it is.

305
00:15:22,144 --> 00:15:24,310
If you give me a pig part,
I might as well be dead.

306
00:15:24,422 --> 00:15:26,384
This orthodox thing was a mistake.

307
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:29,665
What was wrong with being
reform like everyone else?

308
00:15:29,794 --> 00:15:32,108
You guys don't even light candles friday nights.

309
00:15:32,226 --> 00:15:34,566
You don't even know all the passover plagues.

310
00:15:34,653 --> 00:15:37,237
Boils, vermin, pestilence. Even I know that.

311
00:15:39,113 --> 00:15:43,208
Miss Friedman... I appreciate your
extreme religious convictions.

312
00:15:43,295 --> 00:15:45,457
Fire, hail...

313
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,643
Simply put, without this
procedure, you will die.

314
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:52,787
You're hotshot doctors. You'll
come up with something else.

315
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,686
As long as it doesn't answer
to wilbur and say "oink,"

316
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,396
I don't care what it is.

317
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:09,197
Your nostrils are flaring.

318
00:16:09,796 --> 00:16:10,534
They are not.

319
00:16:10,697 --> 00:16:11,961
You're into me. I can tell.

320
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:16,898
Dr. Small-and-angry was a hot appetizer,
but you, doc, are a smorgasbord of lust.

321
00:16:16,996 --> 00:16:18,612
Mr. Duff, you're pressing your luck.

322
00:16:19,126 --> 00:16:20,363
Would you press it for me?

323
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:22,954
I hope you're not claustrophobic.

324
00:16:26,104 --> 00:16:27,983
You're staring at me. Stop it.

325
00:16:28,204 --> 00:16:30,651
I'm looking at you, but it's the strangest thing.

326
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:33,246
I'm hungry for a chocolate cupcake.

327
00:16:33,641 --> 00:16:34,558
What did you say?

328
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,067
A chocolate cupcake.

329
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:39,789
Maybe one of those fudgey things with
the white squiggle on the frosting.

330
00:16:39,888 --> 00:16:40,774
Could you oblige?

331
00:16:42,616 --> 00:16:46,487
What, do I still have some chocolate
on my face or in my hair or something?

332
00:16:47,788 --> 00:16:48,416
What are you talking about?

333
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,141
You. I know the drill, so keep it up.

334
00:16:51,381 --> 00:16:54,694
Next you'll be reading my cards, telling
me my dead uncle is in the room.

335
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:56,655
Is he?

336
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,231
I don't have a dead uncle.

337
00:16:59,845 --> 00:17:00,696
I'm watching you.

338
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,111
- If that's turkey, can I have some?
- It's soggy.

339
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:18,528
Maybe it'll kill you, solve everything.

340
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:21,508
I could have gotten that intubation.
I am good at intubations.

341
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:25,326
Why does everything in a
hospital smell like a hospital?

342
00:17:25,466 --> 00:17:27,652
Don't be so hard on yourself, George.
Everybody makes mistakes.

343
00:17:27,795 --> 00:17:28,824
I'm good at a lot of things.

344
00:17:28,911 --> 00:17:30,073
You know what? I'm gonna tell you something.

345
00:17:30,151 --> 00:17:32,090
Hey, George. You need to get laid.

346
00:17:32,206 --> 00:17:33,364
See that nurse over there?

347
00:17:33,546 --> 00:17:37,133
She's single. She's got red hair. Go ask her out.

348
00:17:37,232 --> 00:17:40,683
- I intubated an esophagus.
- Dude, you're tweaking.

349
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,367
Maybe you should go see that psychic.

350
00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:44,031
Mr. Duff is not a psychic!

351
00:17:44,128 --> 00:17:45,685
I am trying to help you.

352
00:17:45,946 --> 00:17:49,274
Go buy her a latte and freshen
up your gonad, please.

353
00:17:55,827 --> 00:17:56,651
Shut up.

354
00:17:58,197 --> 00:17:59,760
It's not too late to call her.

355
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,150
Moms like that - surprises on their birthdays.

356
00:18:03,896 --> 00:18:05,486
You know, it's very hallmark.

357
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,424
I'm 47, you know? I'm 47 and having a baby,

358
00:18:17,516 --> 00:18:21,376
which is kind of a miracle, and it
kind of sucks, if you see what I mean.

359
00:18:23,209 --> 00:18:26,122
We'd given up on the kid thing about a year ago.

360
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,993
You know, fertility treatments,
acupuncture needles in my eyes.

361
00:18:30,772 --> 00:18:33,256
Well, not really, but it felt like it.

362
00:18:33,348 --> 00:18:36,162
It was like, "screw this. I want my life back."

363
00:18:38,216 --> 00:18:42,071
Then one awesome night on the
beach with a bottle of merlot -

364
00:18:42,158 --> 00:18:44,237
I should have these labs back in a couple hours.

365
00:18:44,386 --> 00:18:45,297
You get it, right?

366
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:47,187
My hesitation?

367
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,294
This isn't an easy decision, I mean.

368
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:51,944
I'm having a baby.

369
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:55,332
You have advanced-stage carcinoma.

370
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:56,818
You're 47 years old.

371
00:18:56,909 --> 00:19:00,242
Statistically you have a good
probability of survival.

372
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:03,566
If you forego treatment, chances are you
won't see your baby go to kindergarten,

373
00:19:03,637 --> 00:19:06,360
so whose life are you interested in saving?

374
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:13,738
Excuse me.

375
00:19:20,443 --> 00:19:22,925
First my legs, then my stomach. God.

376
00:19:23,298 --> 00:19:26,048
Doc! Doc, my hands can't move.

377
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,845
Squeeze my fingers.

378
00:19:27,914 --> 00:19:28,869
I can't.

379
00:19:30,016 --> 00:19:31,259
Right here. No?

380
00:19:32,145 --> 00:19:33,282
Let me know if you feel this.

381
00:19:34,752 --> 00:19:36,390
How about that? Here?

382
00:19:38,142 --> 00:19:40,414
Anything here? Up here? Okay.

383
00:19:40,498 --> 00:19:43,006
Nothing on this side? All right.
I'll be right back.

384
00:19:43,287 --> 00:19:46,461
Nurse, cancel the second M.R.I.
Call down and prep O.R. stat.

385
00:19:47,793 --> 00:19:48,755
You're operating?

386
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:50,029
On what?

387
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:52,105
If there was something to fix,
wouldn't we have seen it?

388
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,335
I think the M.R.I. missed a
clot in his upper spine.

389
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:56,343
I'm gonna cut him open. I'm going in.

390
00:19:56,465 --> 00:19:57,465
What if you're wrong?

391
00:19:57,716 --> 00:20:00,393
Couldn't unnecessary spinal
surgery do more damage?

392
00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:04,473
If we wait any longer, we have a
paralyzed man who can't breathe.

393
00:20:04,678 --> 00:20:05,865
I'm trusting my instincts.

394
00:20:05,964 --> 00:20:08,124
Sometimes you got to take a chance to save a life.

395
00:20:20,704 --> 00:20:22,858
Your mitral regurge is getting worse.

396
00:20:24,463 --> 00:20:26,183
The valves are leakier than ever.

397
00:20:30,704 --> 00:20:31,999
Are you hitting on me?

398
00:20:32,322 --> 00:20:33,320
If you want me to.

399
00:20:34,047 --> 00:20:35,824
I hear they call you Dr. Evilspawn.

400
00:20:35,987 --> 00:20:37,848
Well, only the people that like me.

401
00:20:38,354 --> 00:20:40,509
I guess that explains the lack-of-faith thing.

402
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:43,525
You know, I kind of think
of myself as a pagan, but,

403
00:20:43,913 --> 00:20:46,002
hey, that's just me.

404
00:20:49,628 --> 00:20:52,126
You know what it's like being
a teenager these days?

405
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:56,196
My friends spend most of their time
screwing around and getting wasted.

406
00:20:57,001 --> 00:20:58,419
At least I have god.

407
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,418
Well, so, god wants you to die, huh?

408
00:21:03,185 --> 00:21:05,910
He wants me to be passionate
about what I believe in.

409
00:21:06,795 --> 00:21:08,305
You don't believe in anything.

410
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:11,695
My mother used to pray to Saint Jude for me.

411
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,032
How appropriate -

412
00:21:13,907 --> 00:21:15,873
patron saint of lost causes.

413
00:21:24,553 --> 00:21:26,708
I did an angio on my psych case.

414
00:21:26,933 --> 00:21:30,209
The M.R.I. came out clean, but I saw a ditzel.
There's something here.

415
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,586
Yep, you're right. There's an A.V.M.
on his left temporal lobe.

416
00:21:34,653 --> 00:21:36,035
I'll schedule the O.R. for tonight, then.

417
00:21:36,118 --> 00:21:37,732
Oh, back up, girl.

418
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:39,922
There's high risk of spontaneous hemorrhage.

419
00:21:39,993 --> 00:21:42,509
The attending has to see the films.
We need consent forms.

420
00:21:42,631 --> 00:21:45,510
Believe it or not, Stevens,
we have to follow protocol.

421
00:21:45,575 --> 00:21:48,206
But if the A.V.M. looks like it's
gonna blow, we fix it, right?

422
00:21:48,277 --> 00:21:50,521
If the man needs to be fixed, we'll fix him.

423
00:21:50,587 --> 00:21:52,764
Why are you moving so quickly?

424
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:56,070
You get too involved with your patients, Izzie.

425
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,099
Why do you make everything so personal?

426
00:21:58,969 --> 00:21:59,957
It's not personal.

427
00:22:02,332 --> 00:22:03,346
It's not.

428
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:07,796
Pulse ox - 98.

429
00:22:08,548 --> 00:22:10,002
We've got to save this cord.

430
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,470
This guy's built like the rock of gibraltar.

431
00:22:13,474 --> 00:22:14,451
You want me to start?

432
00:22:14,795 --> 00:22:18,021
I'm gonna cut here from the base
of the neck to the rib cage.

433
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:20,105
I want you to hit the bleeders.

434
00:22:21,476 --> 00:22:23,888
I still don't think we should be doing this.

435
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:27,631
- This guy has a spinal hematoma...
- We don't know that.

436
00:22:27,703 --> 00:22:29,756
Which left untreated are almost always fatal.

437
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:30,893
You're cutting blind.

438
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,854
Whatever happened to being practical?

439
00:22:32,941 --> 00:22:35,398
I need to see more here. retractor.

440
00:22:37,551 --> 00:22:38,474
Wow.

441
00:22:39,766 --> 00:22:40,886
The spine.

442
00:22:41,306 --> 00:22:43,411
There's no "wow" in "practical."

443
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:54,030
We have decided to go ahead with the evacuation.

444
00:22:54,962 --> 00:22:56,201
What the hell, right?

445
00:22:57,557 --> 00:22:59,358
Maybe this is how it's supposed to be.

446
00:23:00,415 --> 00:23:02,180
We need to start chemo right away, then.

447
00:23:02,338 --> 00:23:03,390
We'll get everything ready.

448
00:23:07,957 --> 00:23:09,564
Have you ever done a "d" and "c" before?

449
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:10,747
We learned at school.

450
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,739
Okay, uh, go ahead.

451
00:23:12,846 --> 00:23:15,478
I'll call an O.B. resident down to supervise.

452
00:23:15,651 --> 00:23:18,140
If she needs anything, page me.

453
00:23:37,821 --> 00:23:39,711
You're using up my oxygen, O'Malley.

454
00:23:39,803 --> 00:23:43,950
How does a pompous, cocky jackass like
you always have women all over him?

455
00:23:44,718 --> 00:23:47,196
Little blue love pills - lots of them.

456
00:23:47,688 --> 00:23:48,493
Come on.

457
00:23:49,986 --> 00:23:52,475
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.

458
00:23:53,889 --> 00:23:57,124
There it is - a bovine xenograft.

459
00:24:00,462 --> 00:24:03,709
O'Malley, you think too much. Can't you see it?

460
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,730
You got to dance and jab. Dance and jab.

461
00:24:07,385 --> 00:24:10,518
Like me. I am the Ali of this place.

462
00:24:25,663 --> 00:24:27,619
Does the wall ever bow back?

463
00:24:37,854 --> 00:24:39,733
It's called davening, smartass.

464
00:24:40,142 --> 00:24:42,016
This is me communing with god,

465
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,548
and you're interrupting.

466
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,847
I've found a transplant option.

467
00:24:46,404 --> 00:24:50,004
At first I thought maybe a cadaver,
but they're really hard to find.

468
00:24:50,311 --> 00:24:55,568
And then I realized Dr. Burke can transplant
a bovine mitral valve instead of the pig.

469
00:24:55,713 --> 00:24:57,310
She can get a cow valve?

470
00:24:57,853 --> 00:25:00,187
Dr. Burke, why wasn't this mentioned before?

471
00:25:00,485 --> 00:25:03,767
The bovine valve has only been
an option the last few years.

472
00:25:03,873 --> 00:25:05,620
And it's a much more complicated procedure.

473
00:25:05,707 --> 00:25:08,513
But the best part is it's superior to the pig.

474
00:25:08,682 --> 00:25:09,783
It lasts longer.

475
00:25:11,682 --> 00:25:14,748
What small fraction of your
brain were you using in there?

476
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:18,287
Correct me if I'm wrong, but did you
not present an alternative procedure

477
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,324
without consulting your attending first?

478
00:25:20,427 --> 00:25:21,968
- I thought you'd be -
- What, impressed?

479
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:24,144
- That's just stupid.
- I'm sorry.

480
00:25:24,226 --> 00:25:26,965
We're finished here, Karev. You're off this case.

481
00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:45,740
You need to sign these consent forms
so we can proceed with your surgery.

482
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:50,594
I'm not signing anything unless it's got my
name on it followed by a whole bunch of zeros.

483
00:25:50,732 --> 00:25:54,035
Look, the A.V.M. is located in
this crucial part of the brain.

484
00:25:54,127 --> 00:25:57,737
It's a tangle of blood vessels that could burst
and affect your speech, among other things.

485
00:25:57,829 --> 00:26:00,168
We know your visions are actually seizures.

486
00:26:00,276 --> 00:26:00,875
Do you?

487
00:26:00,968 --> 00:26:01,644
Do I what?

488
00:26:02,467 --> 00:26:03,818
Know they're seizures.

489
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:08,990
You're really good at reading people, aren't
you, telling them what they want to hear?

490
00:26:09,165 --> 00:26:12,314
There's an unfortunate alignment of
saturn in the house of jupiter right now.

491
00:26:13,794 --> 00:26:14,530
Okay.

492
00:26:14,761 --> 00:26:15,984
I know what you're doing.

493
00:26:16,568 --> 00:26:19,134
You watch people - read their body language.

494
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,397
You say "chocolate cupcakes," I lean towards you,

495
00:26:21,473 --> 00:26:23,312
so you think you're on the right track.

496
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,005
Not only do you know you're having
seizures, but you're milking it.

497
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:31,631
Well, we'll just see about that, Cricket.

498
00:26:31,964 --> 00:26:32,587
What?

499
00:26:33,803 --> 00:26:35,007
What did you just call me?

500
00:26:40,961 --> 00:26:42,426
I'm gonna do a quick pelvic exam.

501
00:26:42,514 --> 00:26:44,224
The O.B. resident should be down soon.

502
00:26:44,658 --> 00:26:47,070
It's a short procedure. Your
husband can stay if he likes.

503
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,596
We changed our minds.

504
00:26:48,724 --> 00:26:49,471
Excuse me?

505
00:26:49,722 --> 00:26:51,325
We've decided to keep the baby.

506
00:26:52,764 --> 00:26:54,041
You have cancer.

507
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:57,125
Can you tell me I'll survive
if I go through with this?

508
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:02,036
Having the procedure does not necessarily
improve the treatment outcome.

509
00:27:02,128 --> 00:27:05,057
You have quite the bedside manner.
You know that, right?

510
00:27:06,562 --> 00:27:10,150
My mom died of breast cancer
when she was in her 40s.

511
00:27:10,238 --> 00:27:11,723
I have that cancer gene.

512
00:27:11,801 --> 00:27:15,297
My chances are pretty much lose-lose,
whichever way you look at it,

513
00:27:15,521 --> 00:27:17,022
except for the baby.

514
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:18,732
We're keeping it.

515
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:23,166
- I'll call down a psych consult.
- Don't bother.

516
00:27:23,272 --> 00:27:28,494
I am going to get fat and happy
instead of skinny and bald.

517
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:32,582
- Look, if you want to live -
- Honey, that's what I'm doing.

518
00:27:47,118 --> 00:27:49,722
Look, if you think you're
gonna get any, think again.

519
00:27:50,446 --> 00:27:51,705
I'm not in the mood.

520
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,993
- I'm not in the mood either.
- Good.

521
00:28:00,251 --> 00:28:01,136
What do you want?

522
00:28:01,634 --> 00:28:03,937
Nothing. I just haven't seen you all day.

523
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,520
So, I'm working.

524
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:17,623
I've never done a bovine replacement before.

525
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,728
I don't know what I'm doing.

526
00:28:21,605 --> 00:28:25,094
Look it up, research it, and
get someone to assist you.

527
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:28,677
It's not that easy.

528
00:28:29,177 --> 00:28:31,882
This is a problem that has a solution, Burke.

529
00:28:31,974 --> 00:28:33,388
There are a lot of problems that don't.

530
00:28:39,727 --> 00:28:41,718
Third thoracic laminae. Nothing.

531
00:28:42,358 --> 00:28:44,923
I think I see the dura pulsating here.

532
00:28:45,238 --> 00:28:46,187
No, it's not.

533
00:28:46,454 --> 00:28:47,227
Keep looking.

534
00:28:47,324 --> 00:28:48,809
We have been at this for 4 hours.

535
00:28:48,907 --> 00:28:51,953
Maybe he just injured his spinal
cord, and there's nothing to fix.

536
00:28:52,045 --> 00:28:55,455
Grey, when you read your books, make
sure you reference them correctly.

537
00:28:55,573 --> 00:28:58,276
Progressive paralysis implies a pressure lesion.

538
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,797
My books got me here...

539
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:04,359
Pressure's 180 over 111.

540
00:29:04,457 --> 00:29:05,373
The pulse is in the 40s.

541
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:05,976
What is it?

542
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:07,902
I'm pushing 70 milligrams of diazoxide.

543
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:08,729
Okay.

544
00:29:09,244 --> 00:29:10,539
Autonomic dysreflexia.

545
00:29:10,596 --> 00:29:12,132
Damage to the sympathetic nervous system?

546
00:29:12,198 --> 00:29:14,584
B.P. and the heart rate are unstable.

547
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:15,572
We're in trouble, aren't we?

548
00:29:15,647 --> 00:29:16,786
We've got to find the clot.

549
00:29:19,394 --> 00:29:21,009
Now I can see the cord below the dura.

550
00:29:21,532 --> 00:29:24,824
Focus, Grey. We're gonna find the clot.
It's there.

551
00:29:25,506 --> 00:29:27,257
- Cleanup, please.
- Okay.

552
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:29,572
B.P.'s still up. Heart rate's at 44.

553
00:29:30,611 --> 00:29:31,798
Get on those bleeders.

554
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:37,478
Keep looking, Dr. Grey.

555
00:29:43,672 --> 00:29:45,909
Dr. O'Malley? Our patient's pulse ox is dropping.

556
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:47,349
She's agonal. She needs to be intubated.

557
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,786
Isn't there anyone else who can do this?

558
00:29:50,058 --> 00:29:52,377
You're standing here. I
could try and find someone.

559
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,287
No, that's -

560
00:29:53,964 --> 00:29:54,727
I got it.

561
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:02,406
Okay.

562
00:30:03,395 --> 00:30:05,724
- Sats down to 86%.
- Crich pressure, please.

563
00:30:08,772 --> 00:30:10,091
Okay. I see cords.

564
00:30:10,343 --> 00:30:11,310
Tube. Hurry.

565
00:30:23,461 --> 00:30:24,622
Check for breath sounds.

566
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:32,318
Clear and equal.

567
00:30:32,613 --> 00:30:34,468
C-o-2 detector mellow yellow.

568
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,520
Smooth moves, doctor.

569
00:30:38,042 --> 00:30:38,939
Kicked ass.

570
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:53,919
Oh, Dr. Karev.

571
00:30:55,184 --> 00:30:57,078
How long would it take to get a cow valve?

572
00:30:57,385 --> 00:31:00,114
About 60 minutes by messenger.

573
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:04,232
You're scrubbing in.

574
00:31:05,946 --> 00:31:07,052
Thank you very much, sir.

575
00:31:07,145 --> 00:31:08,932
This doesn't get you any points, Karev.

576
00:31:09,238 --> 00:31:11,184
I'm the only one with points around here, okay?

577
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:18,112
Oh, by the way, Devo wants a rabbi
to bless her before surgery.

578
00:31:18,914 --> 00:31:19,714
Seriously?

579
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,930
You came up with the cow, you
can find that girl a rabbi.

580
00:31:33,104 --> 00:31:34,915
- What is it?
- See for yourself -

581
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:36,913
the second thoracic vertebrae.

582
00:31:40,504 --> 00:31:41,837
Oh, my god.

583
00:31:42,344 --> 00:31:43,164
I see it.

584
00:31:43,938 --> 00:31:45,038
It really is there.

585
00:31:45,206 --> 00:31:46,030
Of course it is.

586
00:31:46,194 --> 00:31:48,381
Let's suction and pack this baby, shall we?

587
00:31:57,112 --> 00:31:57,859
You were right.

588
00:31:59,226 --> 00:32:00,382
Is he gonna be okay?

589
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:01,320
I think so.

590
00:32:01,606 --> 00:32:02,575
But you don't know that.

591
00:32:02,764 --> 00:32:04,934
We stopped the paralysis from advancing.

592
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:08,427
But you don't know if the paralysis
he already has will be permanent.

593
00:32:08,497 --> 00:32:09,051
No.

594
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,103
You keep taking everything on faith.

595
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,016
How do you know what's real and what's not?

596
00:32:15,226 --> 00:32:16,086
You just do.

597
00:32:19,035 --> 00:32:21,088
Some people would call this a relationship.

598
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:24,893
The kind where you exchange keys,
leave your toothbrush over.

599
00:32:25,205 --> 00:32:25,855
Who?

600
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:27,283
Who would call it that?

601
00:32:28,267 --> 00:32:28,917
Me.

602
00:32:30,494 --> 00:32:31,307
I would.

603
00:32:33,714 --> 00:32:35,286
I'm supposed to believe you?

604
00:32:36,382 --> 00:32:37,503
Show me something.

605
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:41,343
Give me a reason to believe.

606
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:56,386
I have your discharge papers.

607
00:32:57,533 --> 00:32:59,709
Oh, you're not happy with me, are you?

608
00:33:00,118 --> 00:33:02,064
I'm your doctor. It's not my place to be happy.

609
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:06,354
My husband and child are going to
be together long after I'm gone.

610
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:07,542
We've talked about it.

611
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:10,455
It's our decision, and that's okay.

612
00:33:10,682 --> 00:33:12,073
So, why do you need my approval?

613
00:33:12,248 --> 00:33:13,641
I want you to understand.

614
00:33:14,198 --> 00:33:15,084
Well, I don't.

615
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,750
I brought the consent forms again.

616
00:33:32,069 --> 00:33:33,654
You really need to sign them.

617
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,853
Your surgeon scheduled the O.R.

618
00:33:36,138 --> 00:33:37,500
Mr. Duff, are you all right?

619
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,813
Are you having another seizure?

620
00:33:44,177 --> 00:33:44,832
Yeah.

621
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:45,743
Yeah.

622
00:33:46,695 --> 00:33:47,858
I think maybe I am.

623
00:33:50,688 --> 00:33:51,442
What is it?

624
00:33:57,305 --> 00:33:58,139
It's me.

625
00:34:01,268 --> 00:34:02,379
I think it's about to be over.

626
00:34:04,525 --> 00:34:06,485
We know what we're doing, Mr. Duff.

627
00:34:06,874 --> 00:34:10,191
You saw the angio results. We're
catching the A.V.M. just in time.

628
00:34:10,263 --> 00:34:12,860
You don't need to be nervous.
You're not gonna die.

629
00:34:13,817 --> 00:34:15,291
I'm not talking about dying.

630
00:34:22,049 --> 00:34:27,866
My whole life has been about what I see and about
believing in myself, whatever people think.

631
00:34:28,281 --> 00:34:30,375
You're telling me there's a
chance that will go away.

632
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,744
Look, you're a healthy guy.

633
00:34:34,502 --> 00:34:36,217
You're gonna live a long, full life.

634
00:34:37,456 --> 00:34:41,829
If your psychic visions are real, you've got
to believe you'll have them when you come out.

635
00:35:43,953 --> 00:35:44,934
She's good.

636
00:35:46,338 --> 00:35:49,081
This is Dr. Chesney from the Cleveland clinic.

637
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:52,808
He's an expert on bovine
valve replacement surgery.

638
00:35:53,024 --> 00:35:55,195
He will be assisting via satellite.

639
00:35:56,861 --> 00:35:57,660
Thank you, doctor.

640
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,910
After the sternotomy and connection to bypass,

641
00:36:02,406 --> 00:36:05,278
we're going to do a transverse left atriotomy

642
00:36:05,401 --> 00:36:06,927
to expose the valve.

643
00:36:19,045 --> 00:36:22,150
I tried to talk Shepherd out of that clot surgery.

644
00:36:22,737 --> 00:36:24,197
What is wrong with me?

645
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,969
Basically, you tried to kill the guy.

646
00:36:26,044 --> 00:36:27,535
Basically, you're an ass.

647
00:36:27,663 --> 00:36:29,076
You know you want it.

648
00:36:29,174 --> 00:36:30,474
Come to papa, baby.

649
00:36:31,811 --> 00:36:36,152
This, uh, is George. George has a hot date.

650
00:36:37,636 --> 00:36:39,368
Oh, that's great, George.

651
00:36:40,688 --> 00:36:41,415
Yeah.

652
00:36:42,296 --> 00:36:44,369
Left pocket of my lab coat, Georgie.

653
00:36:44,641 --> 00:36:46,024
No glove, no love.

654
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:00,707
My psychic had his surgery.

655
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:02,474
Yeah?

656
00:37:03,314 --> 00:37:06,269
I wonder what happened with his... gift.

657
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:08,266
Come on. We all know he's crazy.

658
00:37:08,362 --> 00:37:10,600
You said you didn't believe in that stuff.

659
00:37:14,354 --> 00:37:15,858
I grew up in a trailer park.

660
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,715
I waited tables, which was supposed
to put me through college,

661
00:37:18,812 --> 00:37:24,905
but my mother was always calling
these psychics all the time.

662
00:37:26,027 --> 00:37:29,540
And the bills started piling up, so
I had to use my money to pay them.

663
00:37:30,087 --> 00:37:32,550
When I turned 18, I left and never went back.

664
00:37:33,231 --> 00:37:35,007
But this guy has been saying things to me -

665
00:37:35,074 --> 00:37:37,762
things he couldn't possibly know anything about.

666
00:37:39,262 --> 00:37:42,063
So... I just wonder.

667
00:37:45,843 --> 00:37:47,802
Do you have sensation anywhere else?

668
00:37:48,284 --> 00:37:51,069
Some feeling in my stomach and feet, I guess.

669
00:37:51,157 --> 00:37:52,180
Bladder and bowels?

670
00:37:52,616 --> 00:37:53,849
Not so good still.

671
00:37:54,058 --> 00:37:56,609
The pressure stockings help relieve clots?

672
00:37:56,671 --> 00:37:57,618
They do.

673
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,119
I wanted to thank you... for everything.

674
00:38:12,216 --> 00:38:14,182
Believing in me, that I wasn't making it up.

675
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:18,256
Well, I'll come back tomorrow, then.

676
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:20,059
I wanted to show you something.

677
00:38:21,053 --> 00:38:23,275
I wasn't sure it would last, but now look.

678
00:38:27,433 --> 00:38:28,968
I know it's hardly anything, but -

679
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,791
No, it's something.

680
00:38:32,505 --> 00:38:34,401
It's something really big.

681
00:38:40,606 --> 00:38:44,211
At the end of the day, faith is a funny thing.

682
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,141
It turns up when you don't really expect it.

683
00:38:49,944 --> 00:38:52,858
Mr. Duff, you're still with us.

684
00:38:55,654 --> 00:38:56,601
For your recipe...

685
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:02,530
one tablespoon coconut extract.

686
00:39:05,188 --> 00:39:09,124
It's like one day you realize that the fairy tale

687
00:39:09,201 --> 00:39:12,201
may be slightly different than you dreamed.

688
00:39:21,206 --> 00:39:22,293
Where are we going?

689
00:39:25,124 --> 00:39:25,862
Trust me.

690
00:39:31,963 --> 00:39:36,495
The castle - well, it may not be a castle.

691
00:39:53,352 --> 00:39:56,044
Does it beat... or moo?

692
00:39:56,634 --> 00:39:59,382
And it's not so important
that it's happy ever after...

693
00:40:01,979 --> 00:40:04,110
just that it's happy right now.

694
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:22,959
Mom. It's me...

695
00:40:23,468 --> 00:40:24,210
Cricket.

696
00:40:24,698 --> 00:40:29,509
See, once in a while - once in a blue
moon - people will surprise you.

697
00:40:29,606 --> 00:40:31,194
I've been thinking about you a lot, too.

698
00:40:35,371 --> 00:40:36,288
Where are we?

699
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:38,290
Shh, shh, shh. I'm gonna tell you.

700
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:41,987
All right. My mother's maiden name - Maloney.

701
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:42,985
I have 4 sisters.

702
00:40:43,425 --> 00:40:46,237
I have, uh, 9 nieces.

703
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,212
5 nephews.

704
00:40:48,356 --> 00:40:50,056
I like coffee ice cream,

705
00:40:50,368 --> 00:40:51,678
single-malt scotch,

706
00:40:51,914 --> 00:40:54,213
occasionally a good cigar. I like to fly-fish.

707
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:57,108
I cheat when I do the crossword puzzle on sunday.

708
00:40:57,281 --> 00:40:58,760
And I never dance in public.

709
00:40:59,441 --> 00:41:02,886
Um, favorite novel - "the sun also rises."

710
00:41:02,964 --> 00:41:04,331
Favorite band - The Clash.

711
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:07,085
My favorite color is blue. I
don't like light blue - indigo.

712
00:41:07,526 --> 00:41:11,607
The scar right here on my forehead - that's
why I don't ride motorcycles anymore.

713
00:41:12,574 --> 00:41:14,545
And I live in that trailer.

714
00:41:17,946 --> 00:41:19,338
All this land is mine.

715
00:41:19,951 --> 00:41:21,605
I have no idea what I'm gonna do with it.

716
00:41:22,671 --> 00:41:25,411
So that's it. That's all you've earned for now.

717
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:27,408
The rest you're just -

718
00:41:28,771 --> 00:41:30,357
just gonna have to take on faith.

719
00:41:42,138 --> 00:41:43,406
And once in a while...

720
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,568
people may even take your breath away.
