1
00:00:03,908 --> 00:00:07,424
You know how when you were a little kid and you believed in fairy tales?

2
00:00:11,603 --> 00:00:13,865
That fantasy of what your life would be --

3
00:00:14,844 --> 00:00:19,825
white dress, prince charming, who'd carry you away to a castle on a hill.

4
00:00:21,342 --> 00:00:23,890
You'd lie in bed at night and close your eyes,

5
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:26,717
and you had complete and utter faith.

6
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,759
8 hours, 16 ounces of chocolate, and 32 cupcakes,

7
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,289
and they still don't taste right.

8
00:00:34,485 --> 00:00:36,138
No, these are good.

9
00:00:36,296 --> 00:00:38,053
Martha Stewart would be proud.

10
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,338
Yeah, look where it got her.

11
00:00:39,761 --> 00:00:43,521
Santa Claus, the tooth fairy, prince charming --

12
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,952
they were so close, you could taste them.

13
00:00:46,038 --> 00:00:48,690
There's something missing -- some specific ingredient.

14
00:00:48,754 --> 00:00:49,895
Why can't I remember?

15
00:00:50,002 --> 00:00:52,075
But eventually you grow up.

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,310
One day you open your eyes,

17
00:00:54,381 --> 00:00:56,444
and the fairy tale disappears.

18
00:00:56,531 --> 00:00:57,426
Look, just call her.

19
00:00:57,554 --> 00:00:58,737
Call your mother and ask.

20
00:00:58,855 --> 00:01:02,025
Most people turn to the things and people they can trust.

21
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:03,376
I don't want to call my mother.

22
00:01:07,098 --> 00:01:09,028
So, let's go sleep at your house tonight.

23
00:01:09,816 --> 00:01:10,385
What?

24
00:01:10,452 --> 00:01:12,474
Why are we always sleeping at my house?

25
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:13,888
Do you even have one?

26
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:14,753
One what?

27
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:15,752
A house.

28
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:16,821
With a closet.

29
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:18,691
With your stuff in it.

30
00:01:19,483 --> 00:01:20,636
Your personal stuff.

31
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:22,777
Do you even have one of those?

32
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,159
Good morning.

33
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,273
Hey. You guys want a cupcake?

34
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:30,471
Izzie made 'em.

35
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:32,709
You know, I like it here.

36
00:01:33,089 --> 00:01:35,695
Hey, you said so yourself -- you liked having your things around,

37
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,791
sleeping in your own bed.

38
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:39,605
You're like a health nut, aren't you?

39
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:41,844
You eat muesli every morning.

40
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:44,926
No, I don't.

41
00:01:45,853 --> 00:01:47,982
Okay, the muesli thing -- you do.

42
00:01:48,238 --> 00:01:50,414
- The last 7 days, at least.
- Oh, come on.

43
00:01:51,397 --> 00:01:53,317
I haven't been here for a whole week...

44
00:01:55,196 --> 00:01:55,970
Have I?

45
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:57,378
See?

46
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,671
Even they think it's weird.

47
00:01:59,922 --> 00:02:05,287
But the thing is, it's hard to let go of that fairy tale entirely.

48
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:10,239
Almost everyone still has that smallest bit of hope -- of faith --

49
00:02:10,418 --> 00:02:12,661
that one day they'll open their eyes

50
00:02:13,753 --> 00:02:15,476
and it will all come true.

51
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,828
So, I've checked the schedule.

52
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,359
I start E.N.T. on the 9th.

53
00:02:28,457 --> 00:02:30,554
It's a light rotation. Can you get me in then?

54
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,481
Oh, I'm afraid not.

55
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:35,429
We have openings on the 16th.

56
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:40,448
There are other options besides termination, you know?

57
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,620
Adoption...

58
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:43,734
keeping the baby.

59
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:49,147
- You think it over. Call me back.
- Put me down for the 16th.

60
00:02:49,255 --> 00:02:51,302
I'll confirm after I rearrange my schedule.

61
00:02:52,352 --> 00:02:55,397
- I know this is a difficult decision.
- Okay, you know the talking part?

62
00:02:56,672 --> 00:02:57,969
I'm not interested.

63
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,344
So, Devo, you just had a root canal, correct?

64
00:03:03,605 --> 00:03:04,215
Yeah.

65
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:06,837
I couldn't stop bleeding after -- literally.

66
00:03:06,964 --> 00:03:08,198
Now I'm stuck with you guys.

67
00:03:09,534 --> 00:03:10,415
Give me the bullet.

68
00:03:10,718 --> 00:03:14,885
17-year-old female hospitalized for excessive bleeding, status post root canal.

69
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:17,794
Also had a significant new heart murmur associated with fever.

70
00:03:17,885 --> 00:03:19,431
Now afebrile on antibiotics.

71
00:03:20,488 --> 00:03:22,196
If I'm gonna die, can you page my mom and dad?

72
00:03:22,262 --> 00:03:23,077
You're not dying.

73
00:03:23,256 --> 00:03:24,239
Where are your parents?

74
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:25,319
In the cafeteria.

75
00:03:25,529 --> 00:03:27,485
My freak father likes hospital food.

76
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:31,167
You're in excellent hands here. Dr. Karev is gonna run some labs.

77
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:34,340
And I'll see you with your parents in a little while.

78
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,999
Add a bleeding time to the coags.

79
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:42,307
So, what kind of name is "Devo," anyway?

80
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:43,542
'80s rocker.

81
00:03:43,782 --> 00:03:45,225
My parents did too much blow.

82
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:47,423
I call myself "Esther."

83
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,372
Nice skirt, Esther. What are you, amish?

84
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:53,260
Haven't you ever seen an orthodox jew?

85
00:03:57,126 --> 00:04:00,075
This guy belongs in psych. What are you doing turfing him here?

86
00:04:00,254 --> 00:04:03,899
He's my gift to you. Had a seizure two days ago and another one this morning.

87
00:04:03,986 --> 00:04:05,982
What are you talking about? It says right here,

88
00:04:06,054 --> 00:04:10,302
"he talks to dead people, his family thinks he's dangerous, and they had him committed."

89
00:04:10,402 --> 00:04:11,973
That's psych, not neuro.

90
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,612
Didn't you go to med school?

91
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,591
Yes, unlike the correspondence school you attended.

92
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,123
Oh, that would be stanford, right?

93
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:20,313
I learned not to jump to conclusions.

94
00:04:20,432 --> 00:04:22,916
Sorry, ladies. We can't take him back until he's cleared.

95
00:04:23,038 --> 00:04:24,364
You're dumping him on us?

96
00:04:24,636 --> 00:04:26,674
He thinks his seizures are visions.

97
00:04:26,775 --> 00:04:29,105
Hello! They're not seizures. I'm psychic.

98
00:04:29,213 --> 00:04:30,922
Of course you are, and I'm a chicken.

99
00:04:31,365 --> 00:04:32,705
Hey,  genius.

100
00:04:35,895 --> 00:04:38,858
Okay, Mr. Duff. We're gonna start our work-up now.

101
00:04:38,935 --> 00:04:41,526
Work me up, work me down. I'm telling you, it's a waste of time.

102
00:04:41,609 --> 00:04:43,697
Can you grip my fingers, please?

103
00:04:51,609 --> 00:04:52,509
Cristina...

104
00:04:53,318 --> 00:04:54,142
Mr. Duff?

105
00:04:54,352 --> 00:04:55,581
Mr. Duff, are you okay?

106
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:00,631
Someone...

107
00:05:01,438 --> 00:05:02,259
Someone what?

108
00:05:03,835 --> 00:05:05,068
Someone's gonna check out.

109
00:05:06,304 --> 00:05:07,024
Bye-bye.

110
00:05:07,316 --> 00:05:08,260
The man -- he's nuts.

111
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:12,172
I'm  dizzy, not deaf, lady. Someone on the fourth floor is gonna die.

112
00:05:12,477 --> 00:05:13,824
Code blue, fourth floor.

113
00:05:13,936 --> 00:05:15,176
Code blue, fourth floor.

114
00:05:16,164 --> 00:05:16,844
Got a code.

115
00:05:17,424 --> 00:05:18,182
Right away.

116
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:19,083
Get it.

117
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:08,261
Fourth floor, dead guy. The psychic predicted the fourth-floor dead guy.

118
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:11,266
I need someone to cover me on the 16th. You in?

119
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:14,399
I'm thinking about letting my hair grow.

120
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:17,698
And maybe I won't shave -- go for the stubble effect.

121
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:18,968
What do you think?

122
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:22,229
The 16th, George. Can you cover me or not?

123
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,040
Uh, yeah. I guess. Why?

124
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:26,335
It's none of your business.

125
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:30,640
A "thank you" would be nice.

126
00:06:30,743 --> 00:06:33,323
It's just that I hardly know anything about you.

127
00:06:33,401 --> 00:06:35,560
I'm from New York. I like ferry boats.

128
00:06:35,637 --> 00:06:38,075
Enough with the ferry boats. What about your friends?

129
00:06:38,157 --> 00:06:39,540
I'm a surgeon. I don't have friends.

130
00:06:39,622 --> 00:06:40,973
Everybody has friends.

131
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,359
I mean, who do you hang out with?

132
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:45,131
What do you do on your days off?

133
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:47,927
- These are important questions.
- Ah, important for who?

134
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:50,992
We're having sex every night. I think I deserve details.

135
00:06:51,054 --> 00:06:54,557
- You have more details than most.
- This is going somewhere weird.

136
00:06:54,808 --> 00:06:58,244
I want facts, and until I get them, my pants are staying on.

137
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,102
Or you could just roll with it.

138
00:07:00,635 --> 00:07:02,724
Be flexible. See what happens.

139
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:03,885
I'm not flexible.

140
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:06,527
There I disagree.

141
00:07:06,713 --> 00:07:08,177
Hmm. I got to go.

142
00:07:12,176 --> 00:07:13,465
We'll find these things out.

143
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,879
That's the fun part, you know?

144
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:15,811
That's the gravy.

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,782
That is what I'm talking about.

146
00:07:17,978 --> 00:07:19,690
I don't want to be your gravy.

147
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,522
Your daughter needs a valve replacement.

148
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:28,887
Tests are indicative of von willebrand's disease,

149
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,673
which explains the excessive bleeding after the root canal.

150
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:32,886
And that means?

151
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:36,593
Devo can't take the blood thinners necessary to maintain a mechanical heart valve.

152
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,886
We're suggesting a porcine valve instead.

153
00:07:39,045 --> 00:07:40,008
Porcine?

154
00:07:40,596 --> 00:07:41,728
As in pig?

155
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:44,247
It's the standard of care for someone in this situation.

156
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,331
Pig, huh?

157
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:48,774
It's the other white meat.

158
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:51,964
I don't care what you do. Save my daughter's life.

159
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:02,546
I'm removing the lump now.

160
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,213
Someone said you guys have a psychic running around here. Is that true?

161
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,358
I did not even hear you say that.

162
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:10,554
Predicted someone would die on the fourth floor.

163
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,884
I.C.U.'s on the fourth floor. People die all the time.

164
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:16,258
Okay. We're finishing up here, Mrs. Glass.

165
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:20,762
We'll take this down to path and get the results of the frozen-section biopsy

166
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:22,903
and see you in a few hours.

167
00:08:23,026 --> 00:08:24,992
Seriously, the guy is just playing mind games.

168
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,219
I can see further into the future than he can.

169
00:08:27,543 --> 00:08:29,657
Why do you even care about this, Stevens?

170
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:30,701
I don't.

171
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:35,637
Okay, Mr. Walker. Does that hurt?

172
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,650
I can't feel anything until you get to my thigh.

173
00:08:39,594 --> 00:08:40,789
Try wiggling your toes.

174
00:08:43,588 --> 00:08:44,413
Are they moving?

175
00:08:45,632 --> 00:08:46,767
- No.
- Damn.

176
00:08:47,432 --> 00:08:48,785
I could about 10 minutes ago.

177
00:08:50,077 --> 00:08:52,062
Well, your spine x-rays look clear.

178
00:08:52,226 --> 00:08:53,282
You fell rock-climbing?

179
00:08:53,388 --> 00:08:55,876
In snohomish. Just a small drop. I was belayed.

180
00:08:57,611 --> 00:08:58,923
My wife and boys are on the way.

181
00:08:59,844 --> 00:09:00,981
What's wrong with me, anyway?

182
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,000
Hold your legs up.

183
00:09:06,869 --> 00:09:09,107
- Should I be scared now?
- Just try and relax.

184
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,235
Nurse, I need a stat M.R.I.

185
00:09:12,555 --> 00:09:13,838
Send an intern with him.

186
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:15,999
Make it Meredith Grey.

187
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:21,169
Ew -- thick, short neck. That isn't good.

188
00:09:21,267 --> 00:09:22,711
It's hard to intubate. You want me to do that?

189
00:09:22,803 --> 00:09:24,641
He's my patient. I'm fine.

190
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:27,493
I just can't see anything. Add suction.

191
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:31,184
Don't break any teeth.

192
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,757
Don't you think I know that?

193
00:09:36,715 --> 00:09:38,234
Pulse ox down 87%.

194
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,326
Bag him.

195
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,484
Are you sure you don't want me to do that?

196
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:44,107
No, damn it! Tube.

197
00:09:50,353 --> 00:09:51,035
There.

198
00:09:51,554 --> 00:09:52,755
Huh.  Got it.

199
00:09:57,444 --> 00:09:58,555
It's in the esophagus.

200
00:09:58,637 --> 00:10:00,589
Don't you know an esophagus from a trachea?

201
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:02,800
Damn it! Anatomy is all messed up in here.

202
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,560
Are  you trying to kill this patient, O'Malley?

203
00:10:06,978 --> 00:10:09,138
Maybe we can send you back to practice on mannequins.

204
00:10:09,252 --> 00:10:11,555
No, it's just I haven't done that much --

205
00:10:12,574 --> 00:10:15,436
but when I have, it's -- it's been good.

206
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:19,435
It's just I-I haven't --

207
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:20,746
Let's review the concepts.

208
00:10:21,986 --> 00:10:23,274
Never take your eyes away.

209
00:10:24,477 --> 00:10:26,829
Always -- always -- know you can follow through.

210
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:30,341
Don't ever follow through on one of my patients, O'Malley.

211
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:45,937
Botox would do wonders for all those frown lines.

212
00:10:46,373 --> 00:10:48,584
Okay. Shut up.

213
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:50,078
Are you allowed to talk to me like that?

214
00:10:51,257 --> 00:10:54,721
God, you're hot... in a Mrs. Livingston kind of way.

215
00:10:54,872 --> 00:10:55,578
See here?

216
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:59,198
These are spikes in your temporal lobe.

217
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:02,379
It means you have epilepsy. Not visions. Seizures.

218
00:11:02,485 --> 00:11:03,597
You think I'm epileptic?

219
00:11:03,756 --> 00:11:05,184
That is so not right.

220
00:11:05,573 --> 00:11:08,159
I'm  gonna order an M.R.I. so I can take a closer look at your brain.

221
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:09,300
Yeah, there's no way --

222
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:15,475
Mr. Duff?

223
00:11:16,331 --> 00:11:18,235
Mr. Duff, can you see me? Can you hear me?

224
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,965
Stay with me.

225
00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:23,390
I wouldn't have picked you for the mommy track, nurse Betty.

226
00:11:28,207 --> 00:11:28,895
See?

227
00:11:32,034 --> 00:11:33,200
I told you I know things.

228
00:11:34,702 --> 00:11:37,009
This pregnancy thing -- you can't run away from it.

229
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,006
Dr. Bailey, I want off the psychic case. I'll take whatever you got.

230
00:11:49,134 --> 00:11:49,845
Can I switch?

231
00:11:49,955 --> 00:11:50,875
Ask nicely.

232
00:11:51,596 --> 00:11:53,572
Uh, well, this is me doing nicely.

233
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,451
Look, I know the type.

234
00:11:56,538 --> 00:11:59,426
These guys want everybody to think they're a sideshow. Let me take him.

235
00:11:59,507 --> 00:12:00,916
I don't do switches.

236
00:12:00,997 --> 00:12:02,825
I'll do your post-op notes for a month.

237
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,327
Fine. I can accept that.

238
00:12:06,732 --> 00:12:08,284
Izzie, you get psych guy.

239
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,218
Yay. This is your lucky day.

240
00:12:10,357 --> 00:12:12,277
You get to be with me on the breast cancer.

241
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:15,324
There's spotting. You'll need to do a pelvic. She's pregnant.

242
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:30,683
See? This. The guy's films are clear.

243
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:34,179
There's no reason I can see for his creeping paralysis.

244
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:35,563
It's just so surprising.

245
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,606
I expected an intrusion into the spinal space or a bony spur in the nucleus pulposus.

246
00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:41,743
Well, you were wrong.

247
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,872
You don't always get what you expect, do you?

248
00:12:46,213 --> 00:12:47,840
What is your problem?

249
00:12:48,004 --> 00:12:49,720
Give me something to go on.

250
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:50,610
Anything.

251
00:12:51,241 --> 00:12:52,520
What are your grandparents' names?

252
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,636
I don't have grandparents.

253
00:12:53,728 --> 00:12:54,564
Where'd you grow up?

254
00:12:54,937 --> 00:12:56,714
What's your favorite flavor of ice cream?

255
00:12:56,836 --> 00:12:58,537
Where'd you spend your summer vacations?

256
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:00,717
Lighten up -- it'll be good for your blood pressure.

257
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,124
Oh, don't you tell me to lighten up.

258
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:07,083
I'll lighten up when I... feel light.

259
00:13:09,566 --> 00:13:11,280
Don't we have treatment options?

260
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:13,323
I-I mean, aren't there always alternatives?

261
00:13:13,497 --> 00:13:15,980
With this stage of invasive carcinoma,

262
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:19,877
surgery, chemo, radiation, and drug therapy are your only options.

263
00:13:19,984 --> 00:13:21,736
Can I wait until the end of my pregnancy?

264
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:25,161
The pregnancy hormones will likely speed the growth of the cancer.

265
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,451
And the baby?

266
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,886
None of these courses of treatment will allow the baby to survive.

267
00:13:31,939 --> 00:13:35,120
Mr. and Mrs. Glass, I understand how difficult this is.

268
00:13:35,216 --> 00:13:37,612
No disrespect, but like hell you do.

269
00:13:39,115 --> 00:13:42,903
You're going to have to make a decision as to how you want to proceed.

270
00:13:43,018 --> 00:13:44,699
You mean my baby's life or my own?

271
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:48,477
Yes.

272
00:13:55,108 --> 00:13:56,793
We'll have to evacuate the fetus.

273
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,362
Any changes, Mr. Walker?

274
00:14:06,485 --> 00:14:08,108
I can't move my legs at all now.

275
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,407
He was moving his legs when he came in.

276
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:11,359
What's wrong with him?

277
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:12,393
I don't know.

278
00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:17,215
The paralysis is moving quickly, and there was nothing in the M.R.I. to explain it.

279
00:14:17,462 --> 00:14:19,362
Has tommy been under any stress lately?

280
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:22,275
You know what's making me stressed? Being in here and not being able to move.

281
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,051
Dr. Grey...

282
00:14:26,011 --> 00:14:28,746
Emotional trauma can be converted into something physical, right?

283
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,042
- This is possible.
- Okay.

284
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,997
Like hysterical numbness or paralysis.

285
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:34,047
Maybe there is no physiological reason,

286
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:35,828
and he's just having a conversion reaction.

287
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,000
It's psychosomatic?

288
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,146
It is not in your head, man.

289
00:14:39,274 --> 00:14:40,989
- I believe you.
- Mr. Duff, please.

290
00:14:43,954 --> 00:14:44,743
Who was that?

291
00:14:45,127 --> 00:14:47,348
Psych sent him down. He has visions.

292
00:14:47,465 --> 00:14:48,310
Is that it?

293
00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:49,570
Am I crazy?

294
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:51,485
No. No.

295
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,326
I'm gonna order a higher-level M.R.I.

296
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:56,544
We're gonna figure this out.

297
00:15:02,057 --> 00:15:03,839
You know how important this is to me!

298
00:15:03,931 --> 00:15:05,540
This is about saving your life.

299
00:15:05,611 --> 00:15:08,099
You're not respecting it -- or me.

300
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:12,021
You're letting them put a pig -- a freaking nonkosher, traif mammal --

301
00:15:12,114 --> 00:15:14,648
into my chest -- into my heart --

302
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:16,491
the very essence of my being!

303
00:15:16,588 --> 00:15:18,284
It's a porcine valve, actually.

304
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,065
I don't care what the hell it is.

305
00:15:20,244 --> 00:15:22,410
If you give me a pig part, I might as well be dead.

306
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,484
This orthodox thing was a mistake.

307
00:15:24,627 --> 00:15:27,765
What was wrong with being reform like everyone else?

308
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:30,208
You guys don't even light candles friday nights.

309
00:15:30,326 --> 00:15:32,666
You don't even know all the passover plagues.

310
00:15:32,753 --> 00:15:35,337
Boils, vermin, pestilence. Even I know that.

311
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:41,308
Miss Friedman... I appreciate your extreme religious convictions.

312
00:15:41,395 --> 00:15:45,743
- Fire, hail... 
- Simply put, without this procedure, you will die.

313
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:50,887
You're hotshot doctors. You'll come up with something else.

314
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:53,786
As long as it doesn't answer to wilbur and say "oink,"

315
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:55,496
I don't care what it is.

316
00:16:06,316 --> 00:16:07,297
Your nostrils are flaring.

317
00:16:07,896 --> 00:16:08,634
They are not.

318
00:16:08,797 --> 00:16:10,061
You're into me. I can tell.

319
00:16:10,907 --> 00:16:14,998
Dr. Small-and-angry was a hot appetizer, but you, doc, are a smorgasbord of lust.

320
00:16:15,096 --> 00:16:16,712
Mr. Duff, you're pressing your luck.

321
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,463
Would you press it for me?

322
00:16:19,642 --> 00:16:21,054
I hope you're not claustrophobic.

323
00:16:24,204 --> 00:16:26,083
You're staring at me. Stop it.

324
00:16:26,304 --> 00:16:28,751
I'm looking at you, but it's the strangest thing.

325
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:31,346
I'm hungry for a chocolate cupcake.

326
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:32,658
What did you say?

327
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,167
A chocolate cupcake.

328
00:16:34,336 --> 00:16:37,889
Maybe one of those fudgey things with the white squiggle on the frosting.

329
00:16:37,988 --> 00:16:38,874
Could you oblige?

330
00:16:40,716 --> 00:16:44,587
What, do I still have some chocolate on my face or in my hair or something?

331
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:46,516
What are you talking about?

332
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:49,241
You. I know the drill, so keep it up.

333
00:16:49,481 --> 00:16:52,794
Next you'll be reading my cards, telling me my dead uncle is in the room.

334
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:54,755
Is he?

335
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,331
I don't have a dead uncle.

336
00:16:57,945 --> 00:16:58,796
I'm watching you.

337
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,211
- If that's turkey, can I have some?
- It's soggy.

338
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:16,628
Maybe it'll kill you, solve everything.

339
00:17:16,811 --> 00:17:19,608
I could have gotten that intubation. I am good at intubations.

340
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,426
Why does everything in a hospital smell like a hospital?

341
00:17:23,566 --> 00:17:25,752
Don't be so hard on yourself, George. Everybody makes mistakes.

342
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:26,924
I'm good at a lot of things.

343
00:17:27,011 --> 00:17:28,173
You know what? I'm gonna tell you something.

344
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:30,190
Hey, George. You need to get laid.

345
00:17:30,306 --> 00:17:31,464
See that nurse over there?

346
00:17:31,646 --> 00:17:35,233
She's single. She's got red hair. Go ask her out.

347
00:17:35,332 --> 00:17:38,783
- I intubated an esophagus.
- Dude, you're tweaking.

348
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,467
Maybe you should go see that psychic.

349
00:17:40,574 --> 00:17:42,131
Mr. Duff is not a psychic!

350
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,785
I am trying to help you.

351
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:47,374
Go buy her a latte and freshen up your gonad, please.

352
00:17:53,927 --> 00:17:54,751
Shut up.

353
00:17:56,297 --> 00:17:57,860
It's not too late to call her.

354
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:01,250
Moms like that -- surprises on their birthdays.

355
00:18:01,996 --> 00:18:03,586
You know, it's very hallmark.

356
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,524
I'm 47, you know? I'm 47 and having a baby,

357
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:19,476
which is kind of a miracle, and it kind of sucks, if you see what I mean.

358
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,222
We'd given up on the kid thing about a year ago.

359
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,093
You know, fertility treatments, acupuncture needles in my eyes.

360
00:18:28,872 --> 00:18:31,356
Well, not really, but it felt like it.

361
00:18:31,448 --> 00:18:34,262
It was like, "screw this. I want my life back."

362
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:40,171
Then one awesome night on the beach with a bottle of merlot --

363
00:18:40,258 --> 00:18:42,337
I should have these labs back in a couple hours.

364
00:18:42,486 --> 00:18:43,397
You get it, right?

365
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,287
My hesitation?

366
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,394
This isn't an easy decision, I mean.

367
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,044
I'm having a baby.

368
00:18:51,467 --> 00:18:53,432
You have advanced-stage carcinoma.

369
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:54,918
You're 47 years old.

370
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:58,342
Statistically you have a good probability of survival.

371
00:18:58,461 --> 00:19:01,666
If you forego treatment, chances are you won't see your baby go to kindergarten,

372
00:19:01,737 --> 00:19:04,460
so whose life are you interested in saving?

373
00:19:11,003 --> 00:19:11,838
Excuse me.

374
00:19:18,543 --> 00:19:21,025
First my legs, then my stomach. God.

375
00:19:21,398 --> 00:19:24,148
Doc! Doc, my hands can't move.

376
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,945
Squeeze my fingers.

377
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:26,969
I can't.

378
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:29,359
Right here. No?

379
00:19:30,245 --> 00:19:31,382
Let me know if you feel this.

380
00:19:32,852 --> 00:19:34,490
How  about that? Here?

381
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:38,514
Anything here? Up here? Okay.

382
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:41,106
Nothing on this side? All right. I'll be right back.

383
00:19:41,387 --> 00:19:44,561
Nurse, cancel the second M.R.I. Call down and prep O.R. stat.

384
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,855
You're operating?

385
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:48,129
On what?

386
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:50,205
If there was something to fix, wouldn't we have seen it?

387
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,435
I think the M.R.I. missed a clot in his upper spine.

388
00:19:52,702 --> 00:19:54,443
I'm gonna cut him open. I'm going in.

389
00:19:54,565 --> 00:19:55,565
What if you're wrong?

390
00:19:55,816 --> 00:19:58,493
Couldn't unnecessary spinal surgery do more damage?

391
00:19:58,575 --> 00:20:02,573
If we wait any longer, we have a paralyzed man who can't breathe.

392
00:20:02,778 --> 00:20:03,965
I'm trusting my instincts.

393
00:20:04,064 --> 00:20:06,224
Sometimes you got to take a chance to save a life.

394
00:20:16,204 --> 00:20:18,358
Your mitral regurge is getting worse.

395
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:21,533
The valves are leakier than ever.

396
00:20:26,054 --> 00:20:27,349
Are you hitting on me?

397
00:20:27,672 --> 00:20:28,670
If you want me to.

398
00:20:29,397 --> 00:20:31,174
I hear they call you Dr. Evilspawn.

399
00:20:31,337 --> 00:20:33,198
Well, only the people that like me.

400
00:20:33,704 --> 00:20:35,859
I guess that explains the lack-of-faith thing.

401
00:20:36,207 --> 00:20:38,875
You know, I kind of think of myself as a pagan, but,

402
00:20:39,263 --> 00:20:41,352
hey, that's just me.

403
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:47,476
You know what it's like being a teenager these days?

404
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:51,546
My friends spend most of their time screwing around and getting wasted.

405
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,769
At least I have god.

406
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,768
Well, so, god wants you to die, huh?

407
00:20:58,535 --> 00:21:01,260
He wants me to be passionate about what I believe in.

408
00:21:02,145 --> 00:21:03,655
You don't believe in anything.

409
00:21:04,752 --> 00:21:07,045
My mother used to pray to Saint Jude for me.

410
00:21:07,287 --> 00:21:08,382
How appropriate --

411
00:21:09,257 --> 00:21:11,223
patron saint of lost causes.

412
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,058
I did an angio on my psych case.

413
00:21:22,283 --> 00:21:25,559
The M.R.I. came out clean, but I saw a ditzel. There's something here.

414
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,936
Yep, you're right. There's an A.V.M. on his left temporal lobe.

415
00:21:30,003 --> 00:21:31,385
I'll schedule the O.R. for tonight, then.

416
00:21:31,468 --> 00:21:33,082
Oh, back up, girl.

417
00:21:33,449 --> 00:21:35,272
There's high risk of spontaneous hemorrhage.

418
00:21:35,343 --> 00:21:37,859
The attending has to see the films. We need consent forms.

419
00:21:37,981 --> 00:21:40,860
Believe it or not, Stevens, we have to follow protocol.

420
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,556
But if the A.V.M. looks like it's gonna blow, we fix it, right?

421
00:21:43,627 --> 00:21:45,871
If the man needs to be fixed, we'll fix him.

422
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,114
Why are you moving so quickly?

423
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:51,420
You get too involved with your patients, Izzie.

424
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,449
Why do you make everything so personal?

425
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,307
It's not personal.

426
00:21:57,682 --> 00:21:58,696
It's not.

427
00:22:02,143 --> 00:22:03,146
Pulse ox -- 98.

428
00:22:03,898 --> 00:22:05,352
We've got to save this cord.

429
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,820
This guy's built like the rock of gibraltar.

430
00:22:08,824 --> 00:22:09,801
You want me to start?

431
00:22:10,145 --> 00:22:13,371
I'm gonna cut here from the base of the neck to the rib cage.

432
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:15,455
I want you to hit the bleeders.

433
00:22:16,826 --> 00:22:19,238
I still don't think we should be doing this.

434
00:22:20,329 --> 00:22:22,981
- This guy has a spinal hematoma... 
- We don't know that.

435
00:22:23,053 --> 00:22:25,106
Which left untreated are almost always fatal.

436
00:22:25,182 --> 00:22:26,243
You're cutting blind.

437
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,204
Whatever happened to being practical?

438
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,748
I need to see more here. retractor.

439
00:22:32,901 --> 00:22:33,824
Wow.

440
00:22:35,116 --> 00:22:36,236
The spine.

441
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:38,761
There's no "wow" in "practical."

442
00:22:47,219 --> 00:22:49,380
We have decided to go ahead with the evacuation.

443
00:22:50,312 --> 00:22:51,551
What the hell, right?

444
00:22:52,907 --> 00:22:54,708
Maybe this is how it's supposed to be.

445
00:22:55,765 --> 00:22:57,530
We need to start chemo right away, then.

446
00:22:57,688 --> 00:22:58,740
We'll get everything ready.

447
00:23:03,307 --> 00:23:04,914
Have you ever done a "d" and "c" before?

448
00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:06,097
We learned at school.

449
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,089
Okay, uh, go ahead.

450
00:23:08,196 --> 00:23:10,828
I'll call an O.B. resident down to supervise.

451
00:23:11,001 --> 00:23:13,490
If she needs anything, page me.

452
00:23:33,171 --> 00:23:35,061
You're using up my oxygen, O'Malley.

453
00:23:35,153 --> 00:23:39,300
How does a pompous, cocky jackass like you always have women all over him?

454
00:23:40,068 --> 00:23:42,546
Little blue love pills -- lots of them.

455
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:43,843
Come on.

456
00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:47,825
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.

457
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:52,474
There it is -- a bovine xenograft.

458
00:23:55,812 --> 00:23:59,059
O'Malley, you think too much. Can't you see it?

459
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:02,080
You got to dance and jab. Dance and jab.

460
00:24:02,735 --> 00:24:05,868
Like me. I am the Ali of this place.

461
00:24:21,013 --> 00:24:22,969
Does the wall ever bow back?

462
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:35,083
It's called davening, smartass.

463
00:24:35,492 --> 00:24:37,366
This is me communing with god,

464
00:24:37,705 --> 00:24:38,898
and you're interrupting.

465
00:24:39,132 --> 00:24:41,197
I've found a transplant option.

466
00:24:41,754 --> 00:24:45,354
At first I thought maybe a cadaver, but they're really hard to find.

467
00:24:45,661 --> 00:24:50,918
And then I realized Dr. Burke can transplant a bovine mitral valve instead of the pig.

468
00:24:51,063 --> 00:24:52,660
She can get a cow valve?

469
00:24:53,203 --> 00:24:55,537
Dr. Burke, why wasn't this mentioned before?

470
00:24:55,835 --> 00:24:59,117
The bovine valve has only been an option the last few years.

471
00:24:59,223 --> 00:25:00,970
And it's a much more complicated procedure.

472
00:25:01,057 --> 00:25:03,863
But the best part is it's superior to the pig.

473
00:25:04,032 --> 00:25:05,133
It lasts longer.

474
00:25:07,032 --> 00:25:10,098
What small fraction of your brain were you using in there?

475
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:13,637
Correct me if I'm wrong, but did you not present an alternative procedure

476
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,674
without consulting your attending first?

477
00:25:15,777 --> 00:25:17,318
- I thought you'd be -- 
- What, impressed?

478
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,494
- That's just stupid.
- I'm sorry.

479
00:25:19,576 --> 00:25:22,315
We're finished here, Karev. You're off this case.

480
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:41,090
You need to sign these consent forms so we can proceed with your surgery.

481
00:25:41,428 --> 00:25:45,944
I'm not signing anything unless it's got my name on it followed by a whole bunch of zeros.

482
00:25:46,082 --> 00:25:49,385
Look, the A.V.M. is located in this crucial part of the brain.

483
00:25:49,477 --> 00:25:53,087
It's a tangle of blood vessels that could burst and affect your speech, among other things.

484
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:55,518
We know your visions are actually seizures.

485
00:25:55,626 --> 00:25:56,225
Do you?

486
00:25:56,318 --> 00:25:56,994
Do I what?

487
00:25:57,817 --> 00:25:59,168
Know they're seizures.

488
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:04,340
You're really good at reading people, aren't you, telling them what they want to hear?

489
00:26:04,515 --> 00:26:07,664
There's an unfortunate alignment of saturn in the house of jupiter right now.

490
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:09,880
Okay.

491
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:11,334
I know what you're doing.

492
00:26:11,918 --> 00:26:14,484
You watch people -- read their body language.

493
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,747
You say "chocolate cupcakes," I lean towards you,

494
00:26:16,823 --> 00:26:18,662
so you think you're on the right track.

495
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,355
Not only do you know you're having seizures, but you're milking it.

496
00:26:23,731 --> 00:26:26,981
Well, we'll just see about that, Cricket.

497
00:26:27,264 --> 00:26:27,887
What?

498
00:26:29,003 --> 00:26:30,207
What did you just call me?

499
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,826
I'm gonna do a quick pelvic exam.

500
00:26:37,914 --> 00:26:39,624
The O.B. resident should be down soon.

501
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:42,470
It's a short procedure. Your husband can stay if he likes.

502
00:26:42,797 --> 00:26:43,996
We changed our minds.

503
00:26:44,124 --> 00:26:44,871
Excuse me?

504
00:26:45,122 --> 00:26:46,725
We've decided to keep the baby.

505
00:26:48,164 --> 00:26:49,441
You have cancer.

506
00:26:49,637 --> 00:26:52,525
Can you tell me I'll survive if I go through with this?

507
00:26:54,108 --> 00:26:57,436
Having the procedure does not necessarily improve the treatment outcome.

508
00:26:57,528 --> 00:27:00,457
You have quite the bedside manner. You know that, right?

509
00:27:01,962 --> 00:27:05,550
My mom died of breast cancer when she was in her 40s.

510
00:27:05,638 --> 00:27:07,123
I have that cancer gene.

511
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:10,697
My chances are pretty much lose-lose, whichever way you look at it,

512
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,422
except for the baby.

513
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:14,132
We're keeping it.

514
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,566
- I'll call down a psych consult.
- Don't bother.

515
00:27:18,672 --> 00:27:23,894
I am going to get fat and happy instead of skinny and bald.

516
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:27,982
- Look, if you want to live -- 
- Honey, that's what I'm doing.

517
00:27:42,518 --> 00:27:45,122
Look, if you think you're gonna get any, think again.

518
00:27:45,846 --> 00:27:47,105
I'm not in the mood.

519
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,393
- I'm not in the mood either.
- Good.

520
00:27:55,651 --> 00:27:56,536
What do you want?

521
00:27:57,034 --> 00:27:59,337
Nothing. I just haven't seen you all day.

522
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,920
So, I'm working.

523
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:13,023
I've never done a bovine replacement before.

524
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,128
I don't know what I'm doing.

525
00:28:17,005 --> 00:28:20,494
Look it up, research it, and get someone to assist you.

526
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,077
It's not that easy.

527
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:27,282
This is a problem that has a solution, Burke.

528
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:28,788
There are a lot of problems that don't.

529
00:28:35,127 --> 00:28:37,118
Third thoracic laminae. Nothing.

530
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:40,323
I think I see the dura pulsating here.

531
00:28:40,638 --> 00:28:41,587
No, it's not.

532
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:42,627
Keep looking.

533
00:28:42,724 --> 00:28:44,209
We have been at this for 4 hours.

534
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:47,353
Maybe he just injured his spinal cord, and there's nothing to fix.

535
00:28:47,445 --> 00:28:50,855
Grey, when you read your books, make sure you reference them correctly.

536
00:28:50,973 --> 00:28:53,676
Progressive paralysis implies a pressure lesion.

537
00:28:53,845 --> 00:28:55,197
My books got me here...

538
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:59,759
Pressure's 180 over 111.

539
00:28:59,857 --> 00:29:00,773
The pulse is in the 40s.

540
00:29:00,844 --> 00:29:01,376
What is it?

541
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:03,302
I'm pushing 70 milligrams of diazoxide.

542
00:29:03,379 --> 00:29:04,129
Okay.

543
00:29:04,644 --> 00:29:05,939
Autonomic dysreflexia.

544
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:07,532
Damage to the sympathetic nervous system?

545
00:29:07,598 --> 00:29:09,984
B.P. and the heart rate are unstable.

546
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:10,972
We're in trouble, aren't we?

547
00:29:11,047 --> 00:29:12,186
We've got to find the clot.

548
00:29:13,394 --> 00:29:15,009
I can see the cord below the dura.

549
00:29:15,082 --> 00:29:18,374
Focus, Grey. We're gonna find the clot. It's there.

550
00:29:19,056 --> 00:29:20,807
- Cleanup, please.
- Okay.

551
00:29:20,956 --> 00:29:23,122
B.P.'s still up. Heart rate's at 44.

552
00:29:24,161 --> 00:29:25,348
Get on those bleeders.

553
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:31,028
Keep looking, Dr. Grey.

554
00:29:37,222 --> 00:29:39,459
Dr. O'Malley? Our patient's pulse ox is dropping.

555
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:40,899
She's agonal. She needs to be intubated.

556
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,336
Isn't there anyone else who can do this?

557
00:29:43,608 --> 00:29:45,927
You're standing here. I could try and find someone.

558
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,837
No, that's --

559
00:29:47,514 --> 00:29:48,277
I got it.

560
00:29:55,301 --> 00:29:55,956
Okay.

561
00:29:56,945 --> 00:29:59,274
- Sats down to 86%.
- Crich pressure, please.

562
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:03,641
Okay. I see cords.

563
00:30:03,893 --> 00:30:04,860
Tube. Hurry.

564
00:30:17,011 --> 00:30:18,172
Check for breath sounds.

565
00:30:25,013 --> 00:30:25,868
Clear and equal.

566
00:30:26,163 --> 00:30:28,018
C-o-2 detector mellow yellow.

567
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,070
Smooth moves, doctor.

568
00:30:31,592 --> 00:30:32,489
Kicked ass.

569
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:47,469
Oh, Dr. Karev.

570
00:30:48,734 --> 00:30:50,628
How long would it take to get a cow valve?

571
00:30:50,935 --> 00:30:53,664
About 60 minutes by messenger.

572
00:30:56,849 --> 00:30:57,782
You're scrubbing in.

573
00:30:59,496 --> 00:31:00,602
Thank you very much, sir.

574
00:31:00,695 --> 00:31:02,482
This doesn't get you any points, Karev.

575
00:31:02,788 --> 00:31:04,734
I'm the only one with points around here, okay?

576
00:31:07,677 --> 00:31:11,662
Oh, by the way, Devo wants a rabbi to bless her before surgery.

577
00:31:12,464 --> 00:31:13,264
Seriously?

578
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:16,480
You came up with the cow, you can find that girl a rabbi.

579
00:31:26,654 --> 00:31:28,465
- What is it?
- See for yourself --

580
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:30,463
the second thoracic vertebrae.

581
00:31:34,054 --> 00:31:35,387
Oh, my god.

582
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:36,714
I see it.

583
00:31:37,488 --> 00:31:38,588
It really is there.

584
00:31:38,756 --> 00:31:39,580
Of course it is.

585
00:31:39,744 --> 00:31:41,931
Let's suction and pack this baby, shall we?

586
00:31:50,662 --> 00:31:51,409
You were right.

587
00:31:52,776 --> 00:31:53,932
Is he gonna be okay?

588
00:31:54,117 --> 00:31:54,870
I think so.

589
00:31:55,156 --> 00:31:56,125
But you don't know that.

590
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,484
We stopped the paralysis from advancing.

591
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,977
But you don't know if the paralysis he already has will be permanent.

592
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:02,601
No.

593
00:32:03,186 --> 00:32:05,653
You keep taking everything on faith.

594
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,566
How do you know what's real and what's not?

595
00:32:08,776 --> 00:32:09,636
You just do.

596
00:32:12,585 --> 00:32:14,638
Some people would call this a relationship.

597
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:18,443
The kind where you exchange keys, leave your toothbrush over.

598
00:32:18,755 --> 00:32:19,405
Who?

599
00:32:19,728 --> 00:32:20,833
Who would call it that?

600
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:22,467
Me.

601
00:32:24,044 --> 00:32:24,857
I would.

602
00:32:27,264 --> 00:32:28,836
I'm supposed to believe you?

603
00:32:29,932 --> 00:32:31,053
Show me something.

604
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:34,893
Give me a reason to believe.

605
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:49,936
I have your discharge papers.

606
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:53,259
Oh, you're not happy with me, are you?

607
00:32:53,668 --> 00:32:55,614
I'm your doctor. It's not my place to be happy.

608
00:32:55,906 --> 00:32:59,904
My husband and child are going to be together long after I'm gone.

609
00:33:00,002 --> 00:33:01,092
We've talked about it.

610
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:04,005
It's our decision, and that's okay.

611
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,623
So, why do you need my approval?

612
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:07,191
I want you to understand.

613
00:33:07,748 --> 00:33:08,634
Well, I don't.

614
00:33:23,658 --> 00:33:25,300
I brought the consent forms again.

615
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:27,204
You really need to sign them.

616
00:33:27,762 --> 00:33:29,403
Your surgeon scheduled the O.R.

617
00:33:29,688 --> 00:33:31,050
Mr. Duff, are you all right?

618
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,363
Are you having another seizure?

619
00:33:37,727 --> 00:33:38,382
Yeah.

620
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:39,293
Yeah.

621
00:33:40,245 --> 00:33:41,408
I think maybe I am.

622
00:33:44,238 --> 00:33:44,992
What is it?

623
00:33:50,855 --> 00:33:51,689
It's me.

624
00:33:54,818 --> 00:33:55,929
I think it's about to be over.

625
00:33:58,075 --> 00:34:00,035
We know what we're doing, Mr. Duff.

626
00:34:00,424 --> 00:34:03,741
You saw the angio results. We're catching the A.V.M. just in time.

627
00:34:03,813 --> 00:34:06,410
You don't need to be nervous. You're not gonna die.

628
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:08,841
I'm not talking about dying.

629
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,416
My whole life has been about what I see and about believing in myself, whatever people think.

630
00:34:21,831 --> 00:34:23,925
You're telling me there's a chance that will go away.

631
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,294
Look, you're a healthy guy.

632
00:34:28,052 --> 00:34:29,767
You're gonna live a long, full life.

633
00:34:31,006 --> 00:34:35,379
If your psychic visions are real, you've got to believe you'll have them when you come out.

634
00:35:32,603 --> 00:35:33,584
She's good.

635
00:35:34,988 --> 00:35:37,731
This is Dr. Chesney from the cleveland clinic.

636
00:35:37,864 --> 00:35:41,458
He's an expert on bovine valve replacement surgery.

637
00:35:41,674 --> 00:35:43,845
He will be assisting via satellite.

638
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:46,410
Thank you, doctor.

639
00:35:47,156 --> 00:35:50,660
After the sternotomy and connection to bypass,

640
00:35:51,156 --> 00:35:54,028
we're going to do a transverse left atriotomy

641
00:35:54,151 --> 00:35:55,677
to expose the valve.

642
00:36:07,795 --> 00:36:10,900
I tried to talk Shepherd out of that clot surgery.

643
00:36:11,487 --> 00:36:12,947
What is wrong with me?

644
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,719
Basically, you tried to kill the guy.

645
00:36:14,794 --> 00:36:16,285
Basically, you're an ass.

646
00:36:16,413 --> 00:36:17,826
You know you want it.

647
00:36:17,924 --> 00:36:19,224
Come to papa, baby.

648
00:36:20,561 --> 00:36:24,902
This, uh, is George. George has a hot date.

649
00:36:26,386 --> 00:36:28,118
Oh, that's great, George.

650
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:30,165
Yeah.

651
00:36:31,046 --> 00:36:33,119
Left pocket of my lab coat, Georgie.

652
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:34,774
No glove, no love.

653
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:49,457
My psychic had his surgery.

654
00:36:50,471 --> 00:36:51,224
Yeah?

655
00:36:52,064 --> 00:36:55,019
I wonder what happened with his... gift.

656
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:57,016
Come on. We all know he's crazy.

657
00:36:57,112 --> 00:36:59,350
You said you didn't believe in that stuff.

658
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,608
I grew up in a trailer park.

659
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,465
I waited tables, which was supposed to put me through college,

660
00:37:07,562 --> 00:37:13,655
but my mother was always calling these psychics all the time.

661
00:37:14,777 --> 00:37:18,290
And the bills started piling up, so I had to use my money to pay them.

662
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:21,300
When I turned 18, I left and never went back.

663
00:37:21,981 --> 00:37:23,757
But this guy has been saying things to me --

664
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,512
things he couldn't possibly know anything about.

665
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,813
So... I just wonder.

666
00:37:34,593 --> 00:37:36,552
Do you have sensation anywhere else?

667
00:37:37,034 --> 00:37:39,819
Some feeling in my stomach and feet, I guess.

668
00:37:39,907 --> 00:37:40,930
Bladder and bowels?

669
00:37:41,366 --> 00:37:42,599
Not so good still.

670
00:37:42,808 --> 00:37:45,359
The pressure stockings help relieve clots?

671
00:37:45,421 --> 00:37:46,368
They do.

672
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,869
I wanted to thank you... for everything.

673
00:38:00,966 --> 00:38:02,932
Believing in me, that I wasn't making it up.

674
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:07,006
Well, I'll come back tomorrow, then.

675
00:38:07,309 --> 00:38:08,809
I wanted to show you something.

676
00:38:09,803 --> 00:38:12,025
I wasn't sure it would last, but now look.

677
00:38:16,183 --> 00:38:17,718
I know it's hardly anything, but --

678
00:38:17,806 --> 00:38:19,541
No, it's something.

679
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:23,151
It's something really big.

680
00:38:29,356 --> 00:38:32,961
At the end of the day, faith is a funny thing.

681
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,891
It turns up when you don't really expect it.

682
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:41,608
Mr. Duff, you're still with us.

683
00:38:44,404 --> 00:38:45,351
For your recipe...

684
00:38:48,469 --> 00:38:51,280
one tablespoon coconut extract.

685
00:38:53,938 --> 00:38:57,874
It's like one day you realize that the fairy tale

686
00:38:57,951 --> 00:39:00,951
may be slightly different than you dreamed.

687
00:39:09,956 --> 00:39:11,043
Where are we going?

688
00:39:13,874 --> 00:39:14,612
Trust me.

689
00:39:20,713 --> 00:39:25,245
The castle -- well, it may not be a castle.

690
00:39:42,102 --> 00:39:44,794
Does it beat... or moo?

691
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:48,132
And it's not so important that it's happy ever after...

692
00:39:50,729 --> 00:39:52,860
just that it's happy right now.

693
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:11,709
Mom. It's me...

694
00:40:12,218 --> 00:40:12,960
Cricket.

695
00:40:13,448 --> 00:40:18,259
See, once in a while -- once in a blue moon -- people will surprise you.

696
00:40:18,356 --> 00:40:19,944
I've been thinking about you a lot, too.

697
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:25,038
Where are we?

698
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,040
Shh, shh, shh. I'm gonna tell you.

699
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:30,737
All right. My mother's maiden name -- Maloney.

700
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:31,735
I have 4 sisters.

701
00:40:32,175 --> 00:40:34,987
I have, uh, 9 nieces.

702
00:40:35,427 --> 00:40:36,962
5 nephews.

703
00:40:37,106 --> 00:40:38,806
I like coffee ice cream,

704
00:40:39,118 --> 00:40:40,428
single-malt scotch,

705
00:40:40,664 --> 00:40:42,963
occasionally a good cigar. I like to fly-fish.

706
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,858
I cheat when I do the crossword puzzle on sunday.

707
00:40:46,031 --> 00:40:47,510
And I never dance in public.

708
00:40:48,191 --> 00:40:51,636
Um, favorite novel -- "the sun also rises."

709
00:40:51,714 --> 00:40:53,081
Favorite band -- The Clash.

710
00:40:53,413 --> 00:40:55,835
My favorite color is blue. I don't like light blue -- indigo.

711
00:40:56,276 --> 00:41:00,357
The scar right here on my forehead -- that's why I don't ride motorcycles anymore.

712
00:41:01,324 --> 00:41:03,295
And I live in that trailer.

713
00:41:06,696 --> 00:41:08,088
All this land is mine.

714
00:41:08,701 --> 00:41:10,355
I have no idea what I'm gonna do with it.

715
00:41:11,421 --> 00:41:14,161
So that's it. That's all you've earned for now.

716
00:41:14,861 --> 00:41:16,158
The rest you're just --

717
00:41:17,521 --> 00:41:19,107
just gonna have to take on faith.

718
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,156
And once in a while...

719
00:41:34,461 --> 00:41:37,318
people may even take your breath away.

720
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:54,153
