[derek_shepherd] finishes getting ready in [meredith_grey]'s bedroom while [meredith_grey] watches.
In the kitchen, [izzie_stevens] complains to [george_omalley] about [izzie_stevens]'s cupcakes not tasting right.
[george_omalley] thinks the cupcakes are fine and says [martha_stewart] would approve.
[izzie_stevens] feels she's missing a specific ingredient.
[george_omalley] suggests calling [izzie_stevens]'s mother, but [izzie_stevens] refuses.
[meredith_grey] sees [derek_shepherd] brushing [derek_shepherd]'s teeth and suggests they sleep at [derek_shepherd]'s place tonight.
[meredith_grey] questions why they always stay at her place and wonders if [derek_shepherd] has his own.
[derek_shepherd] doesn't respond and goes to the kitchen.
[derek_shepherd] greets [george_omalley], who offers [derek_shepherd] a cupcake for breakfast.
[derek_shepherd] mentions he likes it there and that [meredith_grey] prefers having her things and sleeping in her own bed.
[george_omalley] wonders if [derek_shepherd] is a health enthusiast because [derek_shepherd] eats muesli every morning.
[derek_shepherd] disagrees, but [izzie_stevens] insists [derek_shepherd] has been for the last seven days.
[derek_shepherd] then realizes he has been there all week.
[cristina_yang] is in a doctor's office.
[cristina_yang] tells someone she is starting an ENT rotation on the 9th and needs something done before then, but there are no openings until the 16th.

[cristina_yang] plans to confirm after adjusting her schedule.
The person tries again to discuss options, but [cristina_yang] insists she's not interested in talking.
[alex_karev] is examining [esther], a patient with a bleeding root canal. [preston_burke] enters and asks for the bullet. [alex_karev] explains that [esther] is a 17-year-old girl in the hospital for excessive bleeding after a root canal. [esther] also developed a new heart murmur with a fever and is still on antibiotics. [esther] asks if she is going to die and requests to call her parents in the cafeteria. [preston_burke] reassures [esther] that she is not dying. [preston_burke] mentions that [alex_karev] will run some tests and he will return later with [esther]'s parents. After [preston_burke] leaves, [alex_karev] questions the name [esther]. [esther] refers to an 80s rock band and says her parents did too many drugs. [esther] tells [alex_karev] she calls herself [esther]. [alex_karev] notices [esther] is wearing a long denim skirt under her hospital gown and jokes about her being Amish. [esther] asks if [alex_karev] has ever seen an Orthodox Jew. Meanwhile, [cristina_yang] is reviewing scans and remarks that the patient should be in psych, questioning why they are sending him to surgery. The psych resident explains that the patient had a seizure two days ago and another one that morning. [meredith_grey] reads the chart and is confused about the patient's claims. The patient says he can talk to dead people. The patient's family thinks he is dangerous and had him committed, insisting it's a psychiatric case, not neurological. [cristina_yang] questions the resident's medical education, offending the resident.
The psych resident responds that unlike [cristina_yang]'s 'correspondence school,' the psych resident learned not to jump to conclusions.
The psych resident sarcastically apologizes, explaining that psychiatry can't take the patient back until [mr_duff] is cleared.
The psych resident mentions [mr_duff] believes his seizures are visions, but [mr_duff] insists they are psychic experiences.
[meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] enter the room and greet [mr_duff], telling him they will start a workup.
[mr_duff] thinks it's a waste of time.
[meredith_grey] checks [mr_duff]'s eyes while [cristina_yang] tests his grip.
[mr_duff] has another seizure and then tells them someone is going to die.
[cristina_yang] is unimpressed and thinks [mr_duff] is crazy.
[mr_duff] says he's dizzy, not deaf, and insists someone on the 4th floor will die.
Suddenly, a code blue is announced for the 4th floor.
[cristina_yang] feels nauseous as she approaches the nurse's station to join [george_omalley].
[george_omalley] is preoccupied with thoughts about a psychic's prediction regarding a dead person on the 4th floor.
[cristina_yang] ignores this and asks if [george_omalley] can cover for her on the 16th.
[george_omalley] is distracted by [derek_shepherd] and [meredith_grey] approaching and mentions he might grow his hair and try a stubble look, asking [cristina_yang]'s opinion.
[cristina_yang] repeats her request for [george_omalley] to cover the 16th.
[george_omalley] agrees and asks why, but [cristina_yang] says it's not his concern and leaves.
[meredith_grey] and [derek_shepherd] walk down the corridor.
[meredith_grey] expresses that she feels she doesn't know much about [derek_shepherd].
[derek_shepherd] insists [meredith_grey] knows him—he's from New York and likes ferry boats.
[meredith_grey] questions [derek_shepherd] about friends.
[derek_shepherd] replies that as a surgeon, he doesn't have friends.
[meredith_grey] continues to ask about [derek_shepherd]'s social life and what he does on his days off, saying these are important questions.
[derek_shepherd] wonders who needs the details, as [meredith_grey] mentions they have sex every night and feels she deserves more information.
[derek_shepherd] believes [meredith_grey] already knows more than most people.
[meredith_grey] finds it strange and decides to withhold sex until she knows [derek_shepherd] better.
[derek_shepherd] suggests [meredith_grey] should be more flexible, but [meredith_grey] insists she isn't.
[derek_shepherd] disagrees with a sly smile before being called away.
[meredith_grey] and [derek_shepherd] exchange looks until [derek_shepherd] mentions that discovering these things is the fun part of a relationship, like the gravy, as he leaves.
[meredith_grey] yells back that she doesn't want to be [derek_shepherd]'s gravy.
[preston_burke] and [alex_karev] are talking to Devo/Esther's parents in the lobby about her treatment.
Devo/Esther needs a valve replacement because her tests show [von_willebrand]'s disease.
[preston_burke] and [alex_karev] explain she can't use blood thinners needed for a mechanical heart valve, so they suggest a pig valve instead.
Devo/Esther's father confirms it's a pig valve, and [preston_burke] says it's the standard care for her condition.
Devo/Esther's mother insists she just wants them to save her daughter's life.
[miranda_bailey] and [izzie_stevens] are performing surgery to remove a lump.
[mrs_glass], who is awake, asks about a psychic in the hospital.
[miranda_bailey] and [izzie_stevens] don't believe the psychic is real.
[izzie_stevens] mentions that the ICU is on the 4th floor, where people often die.
[miranda_bailey] is nearly done with the procedure and explains the next steps.
[izzie_stevens] insists the psychic is a fraud and claims she can predict the future better.
[miranda_bailey] questions why it bothers [izzie_stevens], but [izzie_stevens] denies being bothered.
Meanwhile, [derek_shepherd] is testing nerve response on [mr_walker]'s leg.
[mr_walker] feels nothing until [derek_shepherd] reaches [mr_walker]'s thigh.
[derek_shepherd] asks [mr_walker] to try moving his toes, but [mr_walker] can't.
[mr_walker] mentions he could move them about 10 minutes ago as [derek_shepherd] looks at the X-Rays.
[derek_shepherd] notes the spine looks clear and asks about the injury.
[mr_walker] was rock climbing in Snohomish and had a small fall while belayed.
[mr_walker] mentions his family is coming.
[derek_shepherd] checks [mr_walker]'s leg strength, and [mr_walker] asks if he should be worried.
[derek_shepherd] advises [mr_walker] to relax but requests a nurse for an MRI and asks [meredith_grey] to join him.
[george_omalley] is trying to intubate a patient, but [alex_karev]'s attempt to help makes [george_omalley] more nervous.
[george_omalley] accidentally places the ventilator in the esophagus.

[cristina_yang] asks [miranda_bailey] to reassign [mr_duff] to another doctor. [miranda_bailey] agrees if [cristina_yang] handles [miranda_bailey]'s post-operative paperwork for the next month. [miranda_bailey] then assigns [cristina_yang] to a case involving a pregnant breast cancer patient. [derek_shepherd] and [meredith_grey] examine X-rays of a paralyzed patient. [meredith_grey] asks [derek_shepherd] personal questions because [meredith_grey] feels she doesn't know [derek_shepherd] well. [cristina_yang] speaks with the patient, [zoey_glass], who wants to delay chemotherapy until after [zoey_glass]'s pregnancy. [cristina_yang] explains this isn't possible because pregnancy hormones speed up the cancer. [cristina_yang] states that none of the treatments will allow the baby to survive. The doctors ask [zoey_glass] to choose between undergoing treatment, which means having an abortion, or refusing it and facing death later. [derek_shepherd] and [meredith_grey] talk to [mr_walker] and [mr_walker]'s wife. [meredith_grey] asks if [mr_walker] has been stressed recently. [meredith_grey] then discusses with [derek_shepherd] that mental trauma can sometimes show physical symptoms. [mr_duff] arrives and tells [mr_walker] he believes [mr_walker], saying it's not just a psychosomatic issue. [derek_shepherd] reassures [mr_walker] that [mr_walker] is not crazy. [esther] argues with [esther]'s parents because [esther] doesn’t want a pig valve implanted, as pigs are non-kosher.
[preston_burke] warns [esther] that [esther] will die without the surgery.
[esther] asks [alex_karev] to find another solution.
[izzie_stevens] performs an MRI on [mr_duff], who flirts with [izzie_stevens].

[george_omalley] suggests that [izzie_stevens] call [izzie_stevens]'s mother for her birthday.
[cristina_yang] is with [zoey_glass], who shares that [zoey_glass] conceived [zoey_glass]'s baby later in life after many attempts and now faces a tough decision.
[cristina_yang] interrupts to say [zoey_glass] has a good chance of survival and warns that skipping treatment means missing [zoey_glass]'s child's growth.
[mr_walker] tells [derek_shepherd] he can't move his hands, prompting [derek_shepherd] to quickly prepare an operating room, suspecting a spinal clot.

[cristina_yang] admits she cannot guarantee it.
[zoey_glass] shares that [zoey_glass]'s mother died of cancer, so [zoey_glass] wants to keep the baby.

[cristina_yang] is alone and thoughtful in the dormitory.
[preston_burke], who has been avoiding [cristina_yang], joins her.
