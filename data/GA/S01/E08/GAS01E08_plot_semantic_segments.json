  "marking a new scene. - The segment \"Derek and Meredith look at the X-rays of the paralyzed patient. Meredith starts asking Derek personal questions because Meredith feels Meredith does not know much about Derek.\" is a continuation of an earlier scene and should be merged with the previous Derek/Meredith corridor conversation, as the focus/theme is the same and the action is continuous. - All other segments are valid. **Corrected Segments:**",
  "Derek goes back to Meredith's bedroom and finishes getting ready. Meredith watches Derek.",

Bailey then gives Cristina a new case. Bailey and Cristina will work together on a patient with breast cancer who is also pregnant.",
  "Cristina talks to Zoey Glass, the patient with breast cancer. Zoey wants to wait until Zoey's pregnancy is over before starting chemotherapy. Cristina tells Zoey this is not possible because pregnancy hormones make the cancer grow faster. Cristina says that none of the treatments will allow the baby to survive. The doctors tell Zoey that Zoey must choose between having treatment, which means ending the pregnancy, or refusing treatment and dying later. **Note:** - The segment \"Derek and Meredith look at the X-rays of the paralyzed patient.
