Meredith Grey began the day reflecting on her childhood belief in fairy tales, recalling the hope for a perfect life with Prince Charming and a castle, and how growing up meant letting go of those dreams. In the kitchen, Izzie Stevens grew frustrated after baking for eight hours, eating chocolate and cupcakes but still feeling something was missing from her recipe. Meredith reassured Izzie that the cupcakes were good, while Cristina Yang joked that Martha Stewart would be proud. Izzie lamented her situation, and Meredith continued to muse about losing faith in childhood myths like Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy.

Cristina suggested that Izzie call her mother to ask about the missing ingredient, but Izzie refused. Cristina then proposed that they sleep at Izzie's house instead of Meredith's, questioning whether Meredith even had a home with personal belongings. Their conversation shifted as they arrived at the hospital, where Devo, a teenage patient, offered cupcakes to the staff and talked about her father's habits and her own health-conscious routines.

Cristina reviewed her schedule, trying to find someone to cover her shift on the 16th so she could undergo a medical procedure. The OB/GYN informed her that the earliest available appointment was the 16th and discussed options like adoption or keeping the baby, but Cristina was focused on scheduling a termination. She agreed to the 16th, acknowledging the difficulty of her decision.

Devo was evaluated by the neurology team after experiencing excessive bleeding following a root canal and developing a new heart murmur. She expressed fear of dying and asked about her parents, who were in the cafeteria. Dr. Bailey assured Devo that Dr. Karev would run labs and added a bleeding time to the tests. Alex Karev joked about Devo's name, and Devo explained her parents' drug use. Esther, another patient, introduced herself as Orthodox Jewish, and Karev teased her about her skirt.

Alex Karev brought another patient, Mr. Duff, to Cristina, claiming he belonged in psychiatry due to his seizures and visions. Cristina and Karev argued about whether Mr. Duff should be in neurology or psychiatry, with Cristina reading from his chart that he talked to dead people and had been committed by his family. Dr. Bailey said they could not return him to psychiatry until he was cleared. Meredith noted that Mr. Duff believed his seizures were visions, and Mr. Duff insisted he was psychic, predicting that someone would die on the fourth floor. Cristina and Meredith humored him and began neurological tests, during which Mr. Duff became dizzy and repeated his prediction.

Cristina continued seeking coverage for the 16th, asking George O'Malley, who was distracted by thoughts of growing his hair and stubble. Cristina was secretive about her reasons, and George pressed for personal details, but Cristina claimed she had no friends and was solely focused on surgery. Meredith interjected, wanting facts before getting involved, and Cristina encouraged her to be flexible.

Devo's test results indicated von Willebrand's disease, requiring a valve replacement. The attending doctor recommended a porcine (pig) valve, which Devo's family questioned due to religious concerns. Meanwhile, Mrs. Glass, another patient, was diagnosed with invasive carcinoma while pregnant. Dr. Jennings explained that treatment options—surgery, chemotherapy, radiation—would not allow the baby to survive, and the pregnancy hormones would accelerate the cancer. Mrs. Glass faced the choice between her own life and her baby's.

Mr. Walker, a patient who had fallen while rock climbing, experienced rapid paralysis with no clear MRI findings. Meredith and Dr. Bailey managed his intubation, with George O'Malley struggling but eventually succeeding after guidance. The team initially suspected a conversion reaction due to emotional trauma but ultimately decided to operate, trusting their instincts to find a clot in his spine.

Devo, facing religious objections to a pig valve, debated with her parents and the medical team. Izzie Stevens found an alternative: a bovine (cow) valve, which Dr. Burke confirmed was superior and longer-lasting, though more complex. Dr. Bailey reprimanded Karev for presenting the alternative without consulting her and removed him from the case.

Mr. Duff's MRI revealed an arteriovenous malformation in his temporal lobe, explaining his seizures and visions. Izzie pushed for surgery, but Meredith and Karev reminded her to follow protocol and obtain consent. Mr. Duff was skeptical about losing his psychic abilities after surgery, but the doctors reassured him about his prognosis.

Mrs. Glass and her husband decided to keep the baby despite the risks, rejecting the evacuation procedure. Mrs. Glass shared her family history of cancer and her resolve to choose happiness over treatment. Dr. Jennings called for a psychiatric consult, but Mrs. Glass declined, determined to proceed with her pregnancy.

Cristina confided in Dr. Burke about her uncertainty with the bovine valve procedure, and Burke advised her to research and seek assistance. Meredith and Derek Shepherd operated on Mr. Walker, searching for the elusive clot. The team faced complications, but Meredith persisted, eventually locating the clot and stopping the paralysis from advancing, though the permanence of his condition remained uncertain.

Devo requested a rabbi's blessing before surgery, and Dr. Bailey assigned Karev to fulfill the request. Dr. Chesney from the Cleveland Clinic assisted remotely with the bovine valve replacement, and the surgical team successfully completed the procedure.

George O'Malley was teased about his intubation mishap but was encouraged to pursue a romantic interest. The interns discussed relationships and living arrangements, with Izzie reflecting on her upbringing and her mother's reliance on psychics, questioning whether Mr. Duff's abilities were genuine.

Cricket, a patient recovering from paralysis, thanked the team for believing in him and demonstrated small improvements in movement. He shared a recipe tip with Izzie, revealing the missing ingredient—coconut extract—for her cupcakes. Cricket spoke about faith and the unpredictability of life, emphasizing happiness in the present rather than fairy-tale endings.

As the day ended, the characters shared personal details and moments of vulnerability. Meredith listened as a patient recounted his life story, including family, preferences, and quirks, ending with the notion that some things must be taken on faith. Meredith concluded that, once in a while, people will surprise you and even take your breath away.
