Meredith Grey began by reflecting on childhood fantasies of fairy tales and perfect lives, recalling images of white dresses and Prince Charming. As Meredith grew older, she realized these dreams faded, but she admitted that a small part of hope always remained.

In the kitchen, Izzie Stevens became fixated on baking cupcakes, determined to recreate the taste from her childhood but unable to remember the missing ingredient. Meredith and Cristina Yang sampled Izzie's cupcakes, with Cristina joking that Martha Stewart would be proud. Izzie lamented that something was missing and refused to call her mother for the recipe, despite encouragement from Meredith and Cristina. Cristina suggested they spend the night at Izzie's house for a change, sparking playful debate about whose place felt more like home.

The next morning, the interns gathered and Izzie offered her cupcakes. Cristina teased Meredith about her daily muesli habit, and the group continued their lighthearted argument about whose house they stayed at more often. Cristina checked her schedule, hoping to arrange a light rotation for an upcoming procedure. The scheduler told her the only available slot was on the 16th. Cristina, who was pregnant, was counseled about alternatives to termination, but she chose to schedule the procedure for the 16th, planning to confirm after rearranging her shifts.

Dr. Miranda Bailey assigned the interns to new patients. Izzie and Alex Karev met Devo, a 17-year-old girl hospitalized for excessive bleeding after a root canal. Devo, who joked about her name and her parents' drug use, preferred to be called Esther. Bailey ordered Alex to run labs and additional tests after discovering Devo had a heart murmur and fever.

The interns were also assigned Mr. Duff, a patient transferred from the psychiatric ward after experiencing seizures and claiming to be psychic. The psych resident explained that Mr. Duff talked to dead people and was considered dangerous by his family. The interns began a neurological workup, and during their examination, Mr. Duff predicted that someone would die on the fourth floor. The interns dismissed the prediction, but it soon became a topic of conversation among the hospital staff.

George O'Malley was asked to cover a shift on the 16th and discussed his appearance and personal life with colleagues. Meanwhile, Meredith tried to learn more about Derek Shepherd's personal life, asking about his friends and what he did on his days off. Derek remained evasive, insisting he was a surgeon without friends, but Meredith pressed for answers, joking that she would keep her pants on until he opened up. Derek encouraged her to be flexible and see where their relationship would go.

Devo's parents were informed that she needed a valve replacement due to von Willebrand's disease. The doctors recommended a porcine valve, but Devo and her Orthodox Jewish family objected for religious reasons. The team discussed alternatives, and Izzie later found a more complicated but acceptable bovine valve option.

Another patient, Mrs. Glass, was pregnant and diagnosed with breast cancer. She and her husband faced a heartbreaking decision: undergo aggressive cancer treatment and terminate the pregnancy, or keep the baby and risk her own life. After much deliberation, they decided to keep the baby despite the risks.

Mr. Walker, a patient suffering progressive paralysis after a rock climbing accident, presented a mystery. Despite clear MRI scans, his condition worsened. The team debated whether his symptoms were psychosomatic, but Derek suspected a missed clot in the upper spine and decided to operate. During surgery, the team encountered complications but ultimately found and removed the clot, halting the progression of paralysis.

George O'Malley struggled with his confidence after failing an intubation attempt, but later redeemed himself by successfully intubating a patient during surgery. Cristina and Izzie encouraged him, and Cristina joked that he needed to ask out a nurse.

Cristina, feeling overwhelmed by her first bovine valve replacement surgery, sought advice from Dr. Burke. Burke advised her to research and get assistance, reminding her that some problems had solutions, while others did not.

Izzie became emotionally invested in Mr. Duff's case. After discovering an arteriovenous malformation in his brain, she pushed for surgery. Bailey warned Izzie about getting too involved with patients. As the team prepared for Mr. Duff's surgery, he expressed concern that removing the AVM might take away his psychic abilities, which had defined his life. Izzie reassured him that if his visions were real, he would still have them after surgery.

Before Devo's surgery, she requested a rabbi to bless her, and Izzie arranged it. Dr. Chesney, an expert in bovine valve replacements, assisted via satellite during the procedure. Alex, who had earlier doubted the clot surgery, was teased by Cristina and Izzie. Dr. Burke allowed Alex to scrub in on the bovine valve surgery after he secured the necessary valve, but warned him not to act without consulting attendings in the future.

After the surgeries, Mr. Duff thanked Izzie for believing in him and showed some improvement. Meredith reflected on faith, acknowledging that reality often differed from fairy tales, but happiness could still be found in the present.

Meredith finally called her mother, using the childhood nickname “Cricket,” and said she had been thinking about her. Derek, in turn, opened up to Meredith, sharing personal details about his family, favorite things, and quirks, telling her that the rest she would have to take on faith.

As the day ended, Meredith narrated about faith and the surprises people could bring, while the characters found moments of connection, hope, and happiness in their imperfect lives.
