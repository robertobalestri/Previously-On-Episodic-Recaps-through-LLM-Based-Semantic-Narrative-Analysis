Meredith Grey narrates about childhood beliefs in fairy tales and the hope for a perfect life, referencing images like a white dress and Prince Charming. She reflects on how, as people grow up, these fantasies fade, but a small part of hope remains.

Izzie Stevens is obsessively baking cupcakes, trying to replicate a specific taste from her childhood, but can't remember the missing ingredient. Meredith and Cristina Yang taste the cupcakes, with Cristina joking that Martha Stewart would be proud. Izzie laments that something is missing and refuses to call her mother for the recipe, despite encouragement from Meredith and Cristina. Cristina suggests they sleep at Izzie's house for a change, leading to playful banter about whose house is more of a home.

The interns gather in the morning. Izzie offers cupcakes, and Cristina comments on Meredith's habits, such as eating muesli every morning. They debate whose place they stay at more often. Cristina checks her schedule and tries to arrange a light rotation for an upcoming procedure, but the scheduler only has an opening on the 16th. Cristina is counseled about options besides termination for her pregnancy, but she chooses to schedule the procedure for the 16th, planning to confirm after rearranging her schedule.

Dr. Miranda Bailey and the interns take on several new patients. Devo, a 17-year-old girl, is hospitalized for excessive bleeding after a root canal and is found to have a heart murmur and fever. Bailey assigns Dr. Alex Karev to run labs and orders additional tests. Devo jokes about her name and her parents' drug use, preferring to call herself Esther.

The interns are also assigned a patient, Mr. Duff, who was sent from psych after having seizures and claiming to be psychic. The psych resident says Mr. Duff talks to dead people and is considered dangerous by his family. The interns begin a neurological workup, during which Mr. Duff predicts someone will die on the fourth floor. The interns are skeptical, but the prediction becomes a topic of conversation among staff.

George O'Malley is asked to cover a shift on the 16th and discusses his appearance and personal life with staff. Meanwhile, Meredith tries to learn more about Derek Shepherd's personal life, asking about his friends and what he does on his days off. Derek is evasive, saying he's a surgeon and doesn't have friends, but Meredith insists on knowing more, threatening to keep her pants on until she gets answers. Derek encourages her to be flexible and see where things go.

Devo's parents are told she needs a valve replacement due to von Willebrand's disease. The doctors recommend a porcine (pig) valve, but Devo and her family object for religious reasons, as they are Orthodox Jews. The team discusses alternatives, and Izzie later finds a bovine (cow) valve option, which is more complicated but acceptable to the family.

A breast cancer patient, Mrs. Glass, is pregnant and must choose between aggressive cancer treatment, which would require terminating the pregnancy, or keeping the baby and risking her own life. She and her husband struggle with the decision, ultimately deciding to keep the baby despite the risks.

Mr. Walker, another patient, is experiencing progressive paralysis after a rock climbing accident. Despite clear MRI scans, his condition worsens. The team debates whether his symptoms are psychosomatic, but Dr. Shepherd suspects a missed clot in the upper spine and decides to operate despite the risks. During surgery, the team faces complications, but they eventually find and remove the clot, stopping the progression of paralysis.

George O'Malley struggles with his confidence after a failed intubation attempt but redeems himself later by successfully intubating a patient during surgery. Cristina and Izzie encourage him, and Cristina jokes about him needing to ask out a nurse.

Cristina, feeling overwhelmed by her first bovine valve replacement surgery, seeks advice from Dr. Burke, who tells her to research and get assistance. Burke reminds her that some problems have solutions, while others do not.

Izzie becomes emotionally invested in Mr. Duff's case, pushing for surgery after discovering an AVM (arteriovenous malformation) in his brain. Bailey warns her about getting too involved with patients. The team prepares for Mr. Duff's surgery, and he expresses concern that removing the AVM might take away his psychic abilities, which have defined his life. Izzie reassures him that if his visions are real, he will still have them after surgery.

Before Devo's surgery, she requests a rabbi to bless her, and Izzie arranges it. Dr. Chesney, an expert in bovine valve replacements, assists via satellite during the procedure.

Alex Karev reflects on his earlier skepticism about the clot surgery and is teased by Cristina and Izzie. Dr. Burke allows Alex to scrub in on the bovine valve surgery after he secures the necessary valve, but warns him not to act without consulting attendings in the future.

After the surgeries, Mr. Duff thanks Izzie for believing him and shows some improvement. Meredith reflects on faith and how sometimes reality is different from fairy tales, but happiness can still be found in the present.

Meredith finally calls her mother, using the childhood nickname "Cricket," and says she's been thinking about her. Derek, in turn, opens up to Meredith, sharing personal details about his family, favorite things, and quirks, saying that the rest she will have to take on faith.

The episode ends with Meredith's narration about faith and being surprised by people, as the characters find moments of connection, hope, and happiness in their imperfect lives.
