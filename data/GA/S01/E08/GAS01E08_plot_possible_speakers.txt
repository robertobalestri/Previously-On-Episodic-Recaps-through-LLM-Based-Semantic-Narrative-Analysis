The episode opens with Meredith Grey reflecting on childhood beliefs in fairy tales, describing the hope for a perfect life with Prince Charming and a castle, and how growing up means letting go of those fantasies. Izzie Stevens is frustrated after baking for eight hours, consuming chocolate and cupcakes, but still feels something is missing from her recipe. Meredith reassures her that the cupcakes are good, and Cristina Yang jokes that Martha Stewart would be proud. Izzie laments her situation, and Meredith continues her narration about losing faith in childhood myths like Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy.

Cristina suggests Izzie call her mother to ask about the missing ingredient, but Izzie refuses. Cristina proposes they sleep at Izzie’s house instead of hers, questioning whether Meredith even has a home with personal belongings. The conversation shifts to the hospital, where Devo, a teenage patient, offers cupcakes to staff and discusses her father’s habits and her own health-conscious routines.

Cristina reviews her schedule, seeking coverage for the 16th so she can undergo a procedure. The OB/GYN informs her that the earliest opening is the 16th and discusses options like adoption or keeping the baby, but Cristina is focused on scheduling a termination. She is told to think it over and call back, and agrees to the 16th, acknowledging the difficulty of the decision.

Devo is evaluated by the neurology team after excessive bleeding following a root canal and a new heart murmur. She fears dying and asks about her parents, who are in the cafeteria. Dr. Bailey assures her that Dr. Karev will run labs and adds a bleeding time to the tests. Karev jokes about Devo’s name, and Devo explains her parents’ drug use. Esther, another patient, introduces herself as Orthodox Jewish, and Karev teases her about her skirt.

Alex Karev brings a patient, Mr. Duff, to Cristina, claiming he belongs in psych due to his seizures and visions. Cristina and Karev argue about whether he should be in neurology or psychiatry, with Cristina reading from his chart that he talks to dead people and was committed by his family. Dr. Bailey says they can’t return him to psych until he’s cleared. Meredith notes that Mr. Duff believes his seizures are visions, and Mr. Duff insists he’s psychic, predicting someone will die on the fourth floor. Cristina and Meredith humor him and begin neurological tests, during which Mr. Duff becomes dizzy and reiterates his prediction.

Cristina continues seeking coverage for the 16th, asking George O’Malley, who is distracted by thoughts of growing his hair and stubble. Cristina is secretive about her reasons, and George presses for personal details, but Cristina claims she has no friends and is solely focused on surgery. Meredith interjects, wanting facts before getting involved, and Cristina encourages her to be flexible.

Devo’s test results indicate von Willebrand’s disease, requiring a valve replacement. The attending doctor recommends a porcine (pig) valve, which Devo’s family questions due to religious concerns. Mrs. Glass, another patient, is diagnosed with invasive carcinoma while pregnant. Dr. Jennings explains that treatment options—surgery, chemo, radiation—will not allow the baby to survive, and the pregnancy hormones will accelerate the cancer. Mrs. Glass faces the choice between her life and her baby’s.

Mr. Walker, a patient who fell rock climbing, experiences rapid paralysis with no clear MRI findings. Meredith and Bailey manage his intubation, with O’Malley struggling but eventually succeeding after guidance. The team suspects a conversion reaction due to emotional trauma but ultimately decides to operate, trusting their instincts to find a clot in his spine.

Devo, facing religious objections to a pig valve, debates with her parents and the medical team. Izzie Stevens finds an alternative: a bovine (cow) valve, which Dr. Burke confirms is superior and longer-lasting, though more complex. Dr. Bailey reprimands Karev for presenting the alternative without consulting her and removes him from the case.

Mr. Duff’s MRI reveals an AVM (arteriovenous malformation) in his temporal lobe, explaining his seizures and visions. Izzie pushes for surgery, but Meredith and Karev remind her to follow protocol and obtain consent. Mr. Duff is skeptical about losing his psychic abilities after surgery, but the doctors reassure him about his prognosis.

Mrs. Glass and her husband decide to keep the baby despite the risks, rejecting the evacuation procedure. Mrs. Glass shares her family history of cancer and her resolve to choose happiness over treatment. Dr. Jennings calls for a psych consult, but Mrs. Glass declines, determined to proceed with her pregnancy.

Cristina confides in Burke about her uncertainty with the bovine valve procedure, and Burke advises her to research and seek assistance. Meredith and Derek Shepherd operate on Mr. Walker, searching for the elusive clot. The team faces complications, but Meredith persists, eventually locating the clot and stopping the paralysis from advancing, though the permanence of his condition remains uncertain.

Devo requests a rabbi’s blessing before surgery, and Dr. Bailey assigns Karev to fulfill the request. Dr. Chesney from the Cleveland Clinic assists remotely with the bovine valve replacement. The surgical team successfully completes the procedure.

George O’Malley is teased about his intubation mishap but is encouraged to pursue a romantic interest. The interns discuss relationships and living arrangements, with Izzie reflecting on her upbringing and her mother’s reliance on psychics, questioning whether Mr. Duff’s abilities are genuine.

Cricket, a patient recovering from paralysis, thanks the team for believing in him and demonstrates small improvements in movement. He shares a recipe tip with Izzie, revealing the missing ingredient—coconut extract—for her cupcakes. Cricket narrates about faith and the unpredictability of life, emphasizing happiness in the present rather than fairy-tale endings.

The episode closes with characters sharing personal details and moments of vulnerability. Meredith listens as a patient recounts his life story, including family, preferences, and quirks, ending with the notion that some things must be taken on faith. The narrator concludes that, once in a while, people will surprise you and even take your breath away.
