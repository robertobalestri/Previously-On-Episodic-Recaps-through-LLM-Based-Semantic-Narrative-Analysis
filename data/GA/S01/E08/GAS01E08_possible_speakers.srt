3
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:19,757

4
00:00:21,681 --> 00:00:26,745

5
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:34,368
Izzie Stevens / Mr. Duff OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Eight hours, 16 ounces of chocolate, and 32 cupcakes, and they still don't taste right.

6
00:00:34,892 --> 00:00:36,215

20
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:10,352
Meredith Grey / Mr. Duff (PVM): What?

21
00:01:10,754 --> 00:01:12,516
Cristina Yang / Mr. Duff (PVM): I mean, why are we always sleeping at my house?

22
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:13,998

30
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:32,926

00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,527

39
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:53,450

41
00:01:58,515 --> 00:01:59,638

42
00:02:00,197 --> 00:02:15,591
Meredith Grey / Hospital Intercom OR Mr. Duff (PVM): But the thing is, it's hard to let go of that fairy tale entirely, because almost everyone still has that smallest bit of hope, of faith, that one day they'll open their eyes and it will all come true.

00:02:25,627 --> 00:02:26,908

57
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:54,375

58
00:02:54,395 --> 00:02:55,514

59
00:02:57,198 --> 00:02:57,817

94
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:13,961

144
00:06:43,004 --> 00:06:44,709

00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:46,850

00:06:57,548 --> 00:07:00,531

155
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:01,774

156
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:02,978

157
00:07:03,398 --> 00:07:04,079

172
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,060

183
00:08:07,836 --> 00:08:09,899

191
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:28,499

192
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,980

193
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:31,963

194
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,168

201
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:53,346

204
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:56,590

209

216
00:09:21,788 --> 00:09:22,490

217
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:23,571

218
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:24,211

221
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:28,475

222
00:09:28,495 --> 00:09:28,917

233
00:09:53,908 --> 00:09:54,370

234
00:09:59,235 --> 00:10:00,216

235
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:02,139

237
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:04,585
George O'Malley: Anatomy is all messed up in here.

238
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,167

239
00:10:10,298 --> 00:10:12,880
George O'Malley: No, it's just I haven't done this much.

240
00:10:14,344 --> 00:10:16,985
George O'Malley: But when I have, it's been good.

241
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:20,630
George O'Malley: It's just I haven't.

242
00:10:21,231 --> 00:10:22,455
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Let's review the concept.

243
00:10:23,735 --> 00:10:24,738

244
00:10:25,437 --> 00:10:28,201

245
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:31,868

246
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,302

248

251
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,091

252
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:56,892

253
00:10:56,932 --> 00:11:00,836

254
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:03,118

255

256

257

258
00:11:07,182 --> 00:11:09,682

259
00:11:09,744 --> 00:11:10,543
Patient (possibly Mr. Duff) / Mr. Duff OR George O'Malley OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Yeah, there's no way.

260
00:11:16,312 --> 00:11:16,832

261
00:11:18,014 --> 00:11:18,894

264
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,623

267
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:40,260

268
00:11:47,226 --> 00:11:49,428
Intern (possibly Meredith) / Devo OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Dr. Bailey, I want off the psychic case.

269
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,311
Another Intern (possibly Cristina) / Mr. Duff OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I'll take whatever you got.

270
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:51,230

271
00:11:51,572 --> 00:11:52,274

272
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:54,956

273
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:57,879

274
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,302
Intern (possibly Cristina) / Mr. Duff (PVM): These guys just want everybody to think they're a sideshow.

275
00:12:00,322 --> 00:12:00,883

276
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:02,524

277
00:12:02,663 --> 00:12:04,307

283
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:13,778

284
00:12:14,057 --> 00:12:15,940

285
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,879

289
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:36,065

290
00:12:36,105 --> 00:12:37,287
Resident / Mr. Duff (PVM): It's just so surprising.

291
00:12:38,368 --> 00:12:42,413
Resident / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): I expected an intrusion into the spinal space, where bony sperm the nucleus proposes.

292
00:12:42,653 --> 00:12:43,475
Attending Doctor / Mr. Duff (PVM): Well, you were wrong.

293
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:45,720
Attending Doctor / Mr. Duff OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): You don't always get what you expect, do you?

294
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,572
Resident / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): What is your problem?

295
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:51,254
Resident / Mr. Duff (PVM): Give me something to go on.

296
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:52,254
Resident / Mr. Duff (PVM): Anything.

297
00:12:53,336 --> 00:12:54,437
Resident / Mr. Duff (PVM): What are your grandparents' names?

298
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:55,678
Mr. Walker: I don't have grandparents.

299
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,301

300
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,524

301
00:12:58,803 --> 00:13:00,307

302
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:01,187

303
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:02,629

304
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,753

305
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:08,719

306
00:13:11,643 --> 00:13:13,125
Breast Cancer Patient / Breast Cancer Patient (PVM): Don't we have treatment options?

307
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:15,268
Breast Cancer Patient / Breast Cancer Patient (PVM): I mean, aren't there always alternatives?

308
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:21,618
Attending Doctor / Mr. Duff (PVM): With this stage of invasive carcinoma, surgery, chemo, radiation, and drug therapy are your only options.

309
00:13:21,957 --> 00:13:23,421
Breast Cancer Patient: Can I wait until the end of my pregnancy?

310
00:13:24,022 --> 00:13:26,807
Attending Doctor / Mr. Duff (PVM): The pregnancy hormones will likely speed the growth of the cancer.

311
00:13:27,628 --> 00:13:28,129
Breast Cancer Patient: And the baby?

312
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,432
Attending Doctor / Mr. Duff OR Attending Doctor (PVM): Oh, none of these courses of treatment will allow the baby to survive.

313
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:37,082
Attending Doctor: Mr. and Mrs. Glass, I understand how difficult this is.

314
00:13:37,104 --> 00:13:39,147
Mr. Glass / Attending Doctor (PVM): No disrespect, but like hell you do.

315
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:44,524
Attending Doctor: You're going to have to make a decision as to how you want to proceed.

316
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,509
Breast Cancer Patient: You mean my baby's life or my own?

317
00:13:49,753 --> 00:13:49,971
Attending Doctor: Yes.

318
00:13:57,182 --> 00:13:58,724
Attending Doctor: We'll have to evacuate the fetus.

319
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:08,195
Resident / Mr. Walker (PVM): Any changes, Mr. Walker?

320
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:10,298
Mr. Walker: I can't move my legs at all now.

321
00:14:10,394 --> 00:14:12,120

322
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,162

323
00:14:13,724 --> 00:14:14,163
Mr. Walker: I don't know.

324
00:14:15,225 --> 00:14:18,956
Resident / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Mr. Walker (PVM): The paralysis is moving very quickly, and there was nothing in the MRI to explain it.

325
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:21,221
Resident / Mr. Duff (PVM): Has Tommy been under any stress lately?

326
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,826
Mr. Walker: You know what's making me stressed is being in here and not being able to move.

327
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:25,990
Resident / Mr. Walker (PVM): Dr. Gray.

328
00:14:28,062 --> 00:14:30,725
Resident / Mr. Duff (PVM): Emotional trauma can be converted into something physical, right?

329
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:31,548
Doctor / Mr. Duff (PVM): This is possible.

330
00:14:32,109 --> 00:14:33,710
Doctor / Mr. Duff (PVM): Like hysterical numbness or paralysis.

331
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,754
Doctor / Mr. Duff OR Mr. Duff (PVM): Maybe there is no physiological reason, and he's just having a conversion reaction.

332
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:39,235
Intern / Mr. Duff OR Mr. Duff (PVM): You think it's psychosomatic?

333
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:40,937
Intern / Mr. Duff (PVM): It is not in your head, man.

334
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:42,019
Intern / Mr. Duff (PVM): I believe you.

335
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,801
Doctor / Mr. Duff (PVM): Mr. Duff, please.

336
00:14:46,024 --> 00:14:46,543
Doctor / Mr. Duff (PVM): What was that?

337
00:14:47,306 --> 00:14:48,147
Intern / Mr. Duff (PVM): Psych sent him down.

338
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,028
Intern / Mr. Duff (PVM): He has visions.

339
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:49,889
Doctor / Mr. Walker (PVM): Is that it?

340
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:51,408
Mr. Duff: Am I crazy?

341
00:14:52,552 --> 00:14:53,231
Doctor / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): No, no.

342
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:56,316
Dr. Miranda Bailey: I'm going to order a higher level MRI.

343
00:14:57,341 --> 00:14:58,302
Dr. Miranda Bailey: We're going to figure this out.

344
00:15:04,134 --> 00:15:05,697
Patient (Miss Freeman) / Devo (PVM): You know how important this is to me.

345
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:07,480
Patient (Miss Freeman) / Hospital Intercom OR Devo (PVM): This is about saving your life, sweetie.

346
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,683
Patient (Miss Freeman) / Devo OR Hospital Intercom (PVM): And you're not respecting it, or me.

347
00:15:10,245 --> 00:15:18,422
Miss Freeman: You're letting them put a pig, a freaking non-kosher trade mammal, into my chest, into my heart, the very essence of my being.

348
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:20,336
Dr. Miranda Bailey: It's a porcine valve, actually.

349
00:15:20,355 --> 00:15:21,716
Miss Freeman: I don't care what the hell it is.

350
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,182
Miss Freeman: If you give me a pig part, I might as well be dead.

351
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,625
Patient's Spouse / Mr. Walker (PVM): I told you this whole Orthodox thing was a mistake.

352
00:15:26,644 --> 00:15:29,588
Patient's Spouse / Mr. Walker (PVM): What was so wrong with being clean or reformed like everyone else we know?

353
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:31,892
Patient's Spouse / Devo (PVM): You guys don't even light candles Friday nights.

354
00:15:32,373 --> 00:15:34,394
Patient's Spouse / Devo (PVM): You don't even know all the Passover plagues.

355
00:15:34,696 --> 00:15:37,077
Patient's Spouse / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): Boils, vermin, pestilence, even I know that.

356
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,466
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Miss Freeman, I appreciate your extreme religious convictions.

357
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:44,827
Patient's Spouse / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Fire, hail, slain, firstborn.

358
00:15:44,849 --> 00:15:47,633
Dr. Miranda Bailey: But simply put, without this procedure, you will die.

359
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:50,773
Patient's Spouse / Devo (PVM): You're hot shot, doctors.

360
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:52,315
Patient's Spouse / Devo (PVM): You'll come up with something else.

361
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:57,061
Patient's Spouse / Devo (PVM): As long as it doesn't answer to Wilbur and say oink, I don't care what it is.

362
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:09,115
Mr. Duff: Your nostrils are flaring.

363
00:16:09,956 --> 00:16:10,378
Dr. Miranda Bailey: They are not.

364
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:11,340
Mr. Duff: You're into me.

365
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:11,879
Mr. Duff: I can tell.

366
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,147
Mr. Duff: Dr. Small and Angry was a hot appetizer, but you, Doc, are a smorgasbord of lust.

367
00:16:17,245 --> 00:16:18,649
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Mr. Doff, you're pressing your luck.

368
00:16:19,201 --> 00:16:20,124
Mr. Duff: Would you press it for me?

369
00:16:21,745 --> 00:16:22,846
Dr. Miranda Bailey: I hope you're not claustrophobic.

370
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:27,091
Mr. Duff / Mr. Duff (PVM): You're staring at me.

371
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:27,812
Patient (breast cancer patient) / Mr. Duff (PVM): Stop.

372
00:16:28,312 --> 00:16:30,474
Mr. Duff / Mr. Duff OR Mr. Duff (PVM): I'm looking at you, sweetheart, but it's the strangest thing.

373
00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:32,975
Mr. Duff / Mr. Duff (PVM): I'm hungry for a chocolate cupcake.

374
00:16:33,777 --> 00:16:34,317
Patient (breast cancer patient) / Mr. Duff (PVM): What did you say?

375
00:16:34,356 --> 00:16:35,879
Patient (breast cancer patient) / Mr. Duff (PVM): A chocolate cupcake?

376
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,663
Mr. Duff / Mr. Duff (PVM): Maybe one of those fudgy things with the white squiggle on the frosting.

377
00:16:39,883 --> 00:16:40,403
Mr. Duff / Mr. Duff (PVM): Could you oblige?

378
00:16:42,846 --> 00:16:43,005
Patient (breast cancer patient) / Mr. Duff (PVM): What?

379
00:16:43,826 --> 00:16:46,509
Mr. Duff / Mr. Duff (PVM): Do I still have some chocolate on my face or in my hair or something?

380
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:48,774
Patient (breast cancer patient) / Mr. Duff OR Mr. Duff (PVM): What are you talking about?

381
00:16:49,254 --> 00:16:49,336
Mr. Duff / Mr. Duff (PVM): You.

382
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:50,840
Mr. Duff / Mr. Duff (PVM): I know the drill, so keep it up.

383
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,466
Mr. Duff / Mr. Duff (PVM): Next, you'll be reading my cards, telling me my dead uncle is in the room.

384
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:56,572
Patient (breast cancer patient) / Mr. Duff (PVM): Is he?

385
00:16:57,335 --> 00:16:58,216
Mr. Duff / Mr. Duff (PVM): I don't have a dead uncle.

386
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,454

387
00:17:15,192 --> 00:17:16,682

388
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:17,002
Patient (breast cancer patient) / Mr. Duff (PVM): It's soggy.

389
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:18,432
Patient (breast cancer patient) / Mr. Duff (PVM): It'll kill you to solve everything.

390
00:17:18,934 --> 00:17:20,163
George O'Malley / Mr. Duff (PVM): I could have gotten that intubation.

391
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:21,810
George O'Malley / Mr. Duff (PVM): I am good at intubations.

392
00:17:22,602 --> 00:17:25,423
George O'Malley / Mr. Duff (PVM): Why does everything in a hospital smell like a hospital?

393
00:17:25,443 --> 00:17:26,807
Izzie Stevens / Mr. Duff (PVM): Don't be so hard on yourself, George.

394
00:17:26,905 --> 00:17:27,605

395
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:28,788

397
00:17:29,209 --> 00:17:30,009

398
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:31,832

399
00:17:32,413 --> 00:17:33,173

401

403
00:17:37,278 --> 00:17:39,358

404
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,559
Cristina Yang / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): Dude, you're tweaking.

405
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:42,403
Cristina Yang / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): Maybe you should go see that psychic.

406
00:17:42,522 --> 00:17:44,125
George O'Malley / Mr. Duff (PVM): Mr. Duff is not a psychic!

407
00:17:44,265 --> 00:17:45,625
Cristina Yang / Mr. Duff (PVM): I am trying to help you.

408
00:17:46,105 --> 00:17:48,568
Cristina Yang / Mr. Duff OR Attending Doctor OR Breast Cancer Patient (PVM): Go buy her a latte and freshen up your gonad.

415
00:18:03,964 --> 00:18:05,268

416
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,803
Breast Cancer Patient: I'm 47, you know?

417
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:21,651
Breast Cancer Patient: I'm 47 and having a baby, which is kind of a miracle, and it kind of sucks, if you see what I mean.

418
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:26,146
Breast Cancer Patient: Would have actually given up on the whole kid thing about a year ago.

419
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,832
Breast Cancer Patient: You know, fertility treatments, acupuncture needles in my eyes.

420
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:33,055
Breast Cancer Patient: Well, not really, but it felt like it.

421
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:34,556
Breast Cancer Patient: I was like, screw this.

422
00:18:34,695 --> 00:18:38,318
Breast Cancer Patient: I want my life back.

423
00:18:38,338 --> 00:18:42,163
Breast Cancer Patient: Then one awesome night on the beach with a bottle of Merlot.

424
00:18:42,324 --> 00:18:44,066
Doctor (likely OB/GYN Attending or Resident) / Mr. Duff (PVM): I should have these labs back in a couple hours.

425
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:45,125
Breast Cancer Patient / Breast Cancer Patient (PVM): You get it, right?

426
00:18:46,288 --> 00:18:47,028
Breast Cancer Patient: My hesitation.

427
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,632
Breast Cancer Patient: This isn't an easy decision.

428
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:51,874
Breast Cancer Patient: I mean, I'm having a baby.

429
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,131
Doctor (likely OB/GYN Attending or Resident) / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You have advanced stage carcinoma.

430
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,855
Doctor (likely OB/GYN Attending or Resident) / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You're 47 years old.

431
00:18:56,913 --> 00:19:00,019
Doctor (likely OB/GYN Attending or Resident) / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): So statistically, you have a good probability of survival.

432
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,222
Doctor (likely OB/GYN Attending or Resident) / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Forgo treatment.

433
00:19:01,522 --> 00:19:03,749
Doctor (likely OB/GYN Attending or Resident) / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Chances are you won't see your baby go to kindergarten.

434
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:06,074
Doctor (likely OB/GYN Attending or Resident) / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): So whose life are you interested in saving?

435
00:19:06,114 --> 00:19:14,569
Breast Cancer Patient: Excuse me.

436
00:19:27,105 --> 00:19:27,625
Mr. Walker: Where's my fingers?

437
00:19:28,188 --> 00:19:29,891
Mr. Walker: I can't.

438
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:30,692
Doctor (likely Attending or Intern) / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Right here.

439
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:30,991
Doctor (likely Attending or Intern) / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): No?

440
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:38,027
Doctor (likely Attending or Intern) / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Let me know if you feel this.

441
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:39,307
Doctor (likely Attending or Intern) / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Anything here?

442
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:39,890
Doctor (likely Attending or Intern) / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Up here?

443
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:40,570
Doctor (likely Attending or Intern) / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): OK.

444
00:19:40,592 --> 00:19:41,353
Doctor (likely Attending or Intern) / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Nothing on this side?

445
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:43,457
Doctor (likely Attending or Intern) / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): All right, I'll be right back.

446
00:19:43,477 --> 00:19:44,940
Doctor (likely Attending or Intern) / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Nurse, cancel the second MRI.

447
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:46,583
Doctor (likely Attending or Intern) / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Call down and prep OR staff.

448
00:19:47,845 --> 00:19:48,644
Intern / Mr. Duff (PVM): You're operating?

449
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:49,927
Intern / Mr. Duff (PVM): On what?

450
00:19:50,307 --> 00:19:52,089
Intern / Mr. Duff (PVM): If there was something to fix, wouldn't we have seen it?

451
00:19:52,111 --> 00:19:54,173
Attending / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): I think the MRI missed a clot somewhere in his upper spine.

452
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:55,615
Attending Surgeon / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): I'm going to cut him open.

453
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:56,056
Attending Surgeon / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): I'm going in.

454
00:19:56,576 --> 00:19:57,356
Intern / Hospital Intercom (PVM): What if you're wrong?

455
00:19:57,857 --> 00:20:00,382
Intern / Hospital Intercom OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Couldn't unnecessary spinal surgery do more damage?

456
00:20:00,422 --> 00:20:04,748
Attending Surgeon / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): If we wait any longer and this thing expands into his brain stem, we have a paralyzed man who can't breathe.

457
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:05,729
Attending Surgeon / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): I'm trusting my instincts.

458
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:07,810
Attending Surgeon / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Sometimes you've got to take a chance to save a life.

459
00:20:15,942 --> 00:20:22,796
Doctor (possibly Alex Karev) / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR George O'Malley (PVM): Your mitral regurg is getting worse.

460
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,981
Doctor (possibly Alex Karev) / George O'Malley (PVM): The valves are leakier than ever.

461
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:31,836
Patient (possibly a young woman) / Devo OR George O'Malley (PVM): Are you hitting on me?

462
00:20:32,557 --> 00:20:33,156

463
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,824

464
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:37,653
Doctor (possibly Alex Karev) / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): Only the people that like me.

465
00:20:38,493 --> 00:20:40,356
Patient / Devo (PVM): I guess that explains the lack of faith thing.

466
00:20:40,376 --> 00:20:45,925
Doctor (possibly Alex Karev) / Devo OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Well, I kind of think of myself as a pagan, but, uh, hey, that's just me.

467
00:20:49,892 --> 00:20:51,815
Patient / Devo (PVM): You know what it's like being a teenager these days?

468
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:55,961
Patient / Devo (PVM): My friends spend most of their time screwing around and getting wasted.

469
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,265
Patient / Devo (PVM): At least I have God.

470
00:20:58,403 --> 00:21:02,289
Doctor (possibly Alex Karev) / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Well, so God wants you to die, huh?

471
00:21:03,413 --> 00:21:05,674
Patient / Devo (PVM): He wants me to be passionate about what I believe in.

472
00:21:06,953 --> 00:21:08,174
Doctor (possibly Alex Karev) / Devo (PVM): You don't believe in anything.

473
00:21:09,656 --> 00:21:10,920
Doctor (possibly Alex Karev) / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): No, my mother used to pray to St.

474
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,161
Doctor (possibly Alex Karev) / Devo OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Jude for me.

475
00:21:12,181 --> 00:21:13,060
Patient / Devo (PVM): How appropriate.

476
00:21:14,182 --> 00:21:15,625
Patient / Devo (PVM): Patron saint of lost causes.

477
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:17,307
Doctor (possibly Alex Karev) / Unknown (PVM): Oh.

478
00:21:20,971 --> 00:21:21,791
Patient / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): The fate of Kurt Cobain.

479
00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:26,597
Intern (possibly Izzie Stevens) / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I did an angio on my side case.

480
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,102
Intern (possibly Izzie Stevens) / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): The MRI came out clean, but I saw a digital.

481
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:29,942
Intern (possibly Izzie Stevens) / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): There's something here.

482
00:21:31,463 --> 00:21:31,545
Senior Resident / Attending Doctor OR Attending Doctor (PVM): Yep.

483
00:21:32,182 --> 00:21:34,403
Senior Resident / Attending Doctor (PVM): You're right, there's an AVM on his left temporal lobe.

484
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:36,086
Intern (possibly Izzie Stevens) / Attending Doctor OR Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Attending Doctor (PVM): I'll schedule the OR for tonight, then.

485
00:21:36,826 --> 00:21:37,689
Senior Resident / Attending Doctor (PVM): Oh, back up, girl.

486
00:21:38,328 --> 00:21:40,070
Senior Resident / Attending Doctor (PVM): There's high risk of spontaneous hemorrhage.

487
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:41,432
Senior Resident / Attending Doctor (PVM): The attending has to see the films.

488
00:21:41,471 --> 00:21:42,574
Senior Resident / Attending Doctor (PVM): We need consent forms.

489
00:21:42,894 --> 00:21:45,155
Senior Resident / Attending Doctor (PVM): Believe it or not, Stevens, we have to follow protocol.

490
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:45,677
Senior Resident / Attending Doctor (PVM): Take a breath.

491
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:48,220
Intern (possibly Izzie Stevens) / Attending Doctor (PVM): But if the AVM looks like it's going to blow, we fix it, right?

492
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,364
Senior Resident / Attending Doctor OR Attending Doctor (PVM): If the man needs to be fixed, we'll fix him in due time.

493
00:21:51,403 --> 00:21:52,625
Miranda Bailey / Attending Doctor (PVM): Why are you moving so quickly?

494
00:21:53,306 --> 00:21:56,647
Miranda Bailey / Attending Doctor OR Attending Doctor (PVM): You get too involved with your patients, Izzy.

495
00:21:56,669 --> 00:21:58,131
Miranda Bailey / Attending Doctor (PVM): Why do you make everything so personal?

496
00:21:59,172 --> 00:22:00,011
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): It's not personal.

497
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:03,105
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): It's not.

498
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:09,894
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Devo (PVM): I've got to save this cord.

499
00:22:10,757 --> 00:22:13,661
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Devo (PVM): This guy is built like the rock of Gibraltar.

500
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:14,422
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): You want me to start?

501
00:22:14,942 --> 00:22:17,967
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): No, I'm going to cut here from the base of the neck to the rib cage.

502
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:20,430
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): I want you to hit the bleeders.

503
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:23,634
Izzie Stevens / Hospital Intercom OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): I still don't think we should be doing this.

504
00:22:25,237 --> 00:22:26,759
Miranda Bailey / Hospital Intercom OR Mr. Duff OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): This guy has a spinal hematoma.

505
00:22:26,877 --> 00:22:27,740
Izzie Stevens / Hospital Intercom OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): We don't know that.

506
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,962
Miranda Bailey / Mr. Duff OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Which left untreated are almost always fatal.

507
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:30,943
Izzie Stevens / Mr. Duff (PVM): You're cutting blind.

508
00:22:31,144 --> 00:22:32,665
Izzie Stevens / Mr. Duff (PVM): Whatever happened to being practical?

509
00:22:33,126 --> 00:22:34,028
Miranda Bailey / Mr. Duff (PVM): I need to see more here.

510
00:22:34,107 --> 00:22:34,990
Miranda Bailey / Mr. Duff (PVM): Tractor.

511
00:22:37,813 --> 00:22:38,173
Izzie Stevens / Mr. Duff OR Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Devo (PVM): Wow.

512
00:22:38,973 --> 00:22:39,615
Miranda Bailey / Devo (PVM): Good cap refill.

513
00:22:39,996 --> 00:22:40,717
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): The spine.

514
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:50,750
Miranda Bailey / Mr. Duff OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): There is no wow in practical.

515
00:22:52,112 --> 00:22:54,012
Miranda Bailey / Mr. Duff OR Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Breast Cancer Patient (PVM): We've decided to go ahead with the evacuation.

516
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:57,817
Miranda Bailey / Mr. Duff OR Hospital Intercom OR Breast Cancer Patient (PVM): What the hell, right?

517
00:22:57,837 --> 00:22:59,480
Miranda Bailey / Breast Cancer Patient (PVM): Maybe this is how it's supposed to be.

518
00:23:00,522 --> 00:23:02,047
Cristina Yang / Attending Doctor (PVM): We need to start chemo right away, then.

519
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:03,228
Izzie Stevens / Attending Doctor (PVM): We'll get everything ready.

520
00:23:08,217 --> 00:23:09,499
Miranda Bailey / Attending Doctor (PVM): You ever done a DNC before?

521
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,661
Izzie Stevens / Attending Doctor (PVM): We learn at school.

522
00:23:11,461 --> 00:23:12,903
Miranda Bailey / Attending Doctor (PVM): OK, go ahead.

523
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:15,910
Miranda Bailey / Attending Doctor (PVM): I'll call an OP resident down to supervise.

524
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,991
Miranda Bailey / Attending Doctor (PVM): If she needs anything, page me.

525
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,903
Alex Karev / George O'Malley (PVM): You're using up my oxygen, O'Malley.

526
00:23:39,923 --> 00:23:43,768
George O'Malley / George O'Malley OR Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): How does a pompous cocky jackass like you always have women all over him?

527
00:23:44,969 --> 00:23:45,890
Dr. Alex Karev: Little blue love pills.

528
00:23:46,568 --> 00:23:48,230
Dr. Alex Karev: Lots of them.

529
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,294
George O'Malley: Come on.

530
00:23:50,314 --> 00:23:52,335
Dr. Alex Karev: Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.

531
00:23:54,115 --> 00:23:54,537
Dr. Alex Karev: There it is.

532
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:57,038
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Alex Karev OR Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): A bovine xenograft.

533
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,502
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): O'Malley, you think too much.

534
00:24:02,923 --> 00:24:03,585
Alex Karev / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): Can't you see it?

535
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,486
Alex Karev / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): You got to dance and jab.

536
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:07,268
Alex Karev / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): Dance and jab.

537
00:24:07,535 --> 00:24:08,194
Alex Karev / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): Like me.

538
00:24:08,817 --> 00:24:10,459
Alex Karev / George O'Malley OR Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): I am the Ali of this place.

539
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:28,884
Patient / Dr. Alex Karev OR Devo (PVM): Does the wall ever bow back?

540
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:39,548
Cristina Yang / Devo (PVM): It's called davening, smartass.

541
00:24:40,352 --> 00:24:43,457
Cristina Yang / Devo (PVM): This is me communing with God, and you're interrupting.

542
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:45,720
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): I've found a transplant option.

543
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,865
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley OR Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): At first, I thought maybe a cadaver, but they're really hard to find.

544
00:24:50,646 --> 00:24:55,375
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): And then I realized Dr. Burke can transplant a bovine mitral valve instead of the pig.

545
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:57,156
Patient's Family Member / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): She can get a cow valve?

546
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,103
Patient's Family Member / Hospital Intercom (PVM): Dr. Burke, why wasn't this mentioned before?

547
00:25:00,942 --> 00:25:03,548
Dr. Burke / Hospital Intercom OR Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): The divine valve has only been an option the last few years.

548
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:05,691
Dr. Burke / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): And it's a much more complicated procedure.

549
00:25:05,711 --> 00:25:08,875
Dr. Burke / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): But the best part is it's actually superior to the pig.

550
00:25:08,894 --> 00:25:09,497
Dr. Burke / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): It lasts longer.

551
00:25:09,537 --> 00:25:14,565
Dr. Burke / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): What incredibly small fraction of your brain were you using there?

552
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:15,326
Alex Karev / Mr. Duff (PVM): What?

553
00:25:15,665 --> 00:25:20,272
Dr. Burke / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Correct me if I'm wrong, but did you not present an alternative procedure without consulting your attending first?

554
00:25:20,574 --> 00:25:21,756
Alex Karev / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I thought you'd be... What, impressed?

555
00:25:22,477 --> 00:25:23,298
Dr. Burke / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): That's just stupid.

556
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,338
Alex Karev / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I'm sorry.

557
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:25,300
Dr. Burke / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): We're finished here, Karev.

558
00:25:25,842 --> 00:25:26,884
Dr. Burke / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You're off this case.

559
00:25:42,404 --> 00:25:45,607
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You need to sign these consent forms so we can proceed with your surgery.

560
00:25:46,367 --> 00:25:50,451
Patient / Mr. Duff (PVM): Sweetheart, I'm not signing anything unless it's got my name on it, followed by a whole bunch of zeros.

561
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:53,894
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Look, the AVM is located in this crucial part of the brain.

562
00:25:53,954 --> 00:25:57,798
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): It's a tangle of blood vessels that could burst and affect your speech, among other things.

563
00:25:57,877 --> 00:26:00,161
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): So we know your visions are actually seizures.

564
00:26:00,402 --> 00:26:00,701
Patient / Mr. Duff (PVM): Do you?

565
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,583
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Do I what?

566
00:26:02,844 --> 00:26:03,624
Patient / Mr. Duff (PVM): Know they're seizures.

567
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:06,945
Miranda Bailey / Mr. Duff (PVM): You're really good at reading people, aren't you?

568
00:26:07,626 --> 00:26:08,689
Miranda Bailey / Mr. Duff (PVM): Telling them what they want to hear.

569
00:26:09,347 --> 00:26:12,310
Patient / Mr. Duff (PVM): There's a really unfortunate alignment of Saturn in the house of Jupiter right now.

570
00:26:13,979 --> 00:26:15,961
Miranda Bailey / Mr. Duff OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Okay, I know what you're doing.

571
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,183
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You watch people, read their body language.

572
00:26:19,605 --> 00:26:23,269
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You say chocolate cupcakes, I lean towards you, so you think you're on the right track.

573
00:26:23,611 --> 00:26:25,932

710
00:33:10,933 --> 00:33:11,935

711
00:33:11,977 --> 00:33:13,558
