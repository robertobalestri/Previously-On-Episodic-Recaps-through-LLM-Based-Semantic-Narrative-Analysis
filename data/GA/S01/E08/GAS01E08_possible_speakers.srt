4
00:00:21,681 --> 00:00:26,745

5
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:34,368
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Eight hours, 16 ounces of chocolate, and 32 cupcakes, and they still don't taste right.

00:01:58,515 --> 00:01:59,638

42
00:02:00,197 --> 00:02:15,591
Dr. Meredith Gray: But the thing is, it's hard to let go of that fairy tale entirely, because almost everyone still has that smallest bit of hope, of faith, that one day they'll open their eyes and it will all come true.

00:02:25,627 --> 00:02:26,908

291
00:12:38,368 --> 00:12:42,413
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I expected an intrusion into the spinal space, where bony sperm the nucleus proposes.

292
00:12:42,653 --> 00:12:43,475
Meredith Grey / Mr. Duff (PVM): Well, you were wrong.

293
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:45,720
Meredith Grey / Mr. Duff OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You don't always get what you expect, do you?

294
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,572
Cristina Yang / Mr. Duff OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): What is your problem?

295
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:51,254
Cristina Yang / Mr. Duff (PVM): Give me something to go on.

296
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:52,254
Cristina Yang / Mr. Duff (PVM): Anything.

297
00:12:53,336 --> 00:12:54,437
Cristina Yang / Mr. Duff (PVM): What are your grandparents' names?

298
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:55,678
Patient / Mr. Duff OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I don't have grandparents.

299
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,301
Cristina Yang / Mr. Duff (PVM): Where'd you grow up?

300
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,524
Cristina Yang / Mr. Duff (PVM): What's your favorite flavor of ice cream?

301
00:12:58,803 --> 00:13:00,307

302
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:01,187
Doctor / Mr. Duff (PVM): Lighten up.

303
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:02,629
Doctor / Mr. Duff (PVM): It'll be good for your blood pressure.

304
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,753
Mrs. Glass / Mr. Duff (PVM): Oh, don't you tell me to lighten up.

305
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:08,719

306
00:13:11,643 --> 00:13:13,125
Mrs. Glass / Dr. Karev (PVM): Don't we have treatment options?

307
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:15,268
Mrs. Glass / Dr. Karev (PVM): I mean, aren't there always alternatives?

308
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:21,618
Dr. Jennings: With this stage of invasive carcinoma, surgery, chemo, radiation, and drug therapy are your only options.

309
00:13:21,957 --> 00:13:23,421
Mrs. Glass / Mr. Duff (PVM): Can I wait until the end of my pregnancy?

310
00:13:24,022 --> 00:13:26,807
Dr. Jennings: The pregnancy hormones will likely speed the growth of the cancer.

311
00:13:27,628 --> 00:13:28,129
Mrs. Glass / Dr. Karev (PVM): And the baby?

312
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,432
Dr. Jennings: Oh, none of these courses of treatment will allow the baby to survive.

313
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:37,082
Dr. Jennings: Mr. and Mrs. Glass, I understand how difficult this is.

314
00:13:37,104 --> 00:13:39,147
Mrs. Glass / Dr. Jennings (PVM): No disrespect, but like hell you do.

315
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:44,524
Dr. Jennings: You're going to have to make a decision as to how you want to proceed.

316
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,509
Mrs. Glass / Dr. Jennings (PVM): You mean my baby's life or my own?

317
00:13:49,753 --> 00:13:49,971
Dr. Jennings: Yes.

318
00:13:57,182 --> 00:13:58,724
Dr. Jennings: We'll have to evacuate the fetus.

319
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:08,195
Doctor / Mr. Walker (PVM): Any changes, Mr. Walker?

320
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:10,298
Mr. Walker: I can't move my legs at all now.

321
00:14:10,394 --> 00:14:12,120

322
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,162

323
00:14:13,724 --> 00:14:14,163
Doctor / Dr. Jennings (PVM): I don't know.

324
00:14:15,225 --> 00:14:18,956
Dr. Jennings: The paralysis is moving very quickly, and there was nothing in the MRI to explain it.

325
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:21,221
Doctor / Mr. Duff (PVM): Has Tommy been under any stress lately?

326
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,826
Mr. Walker / Cricket (PVM): You know what's making me stressed is being in here and not being able to move.

327
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:25,990
Unknown / Cricket (PVM): Dr. Gray.

328
00:14:28,062 --> 00:14:30,725
Dr. Gray / Mr. Duff (PVM): Emotional trauma can be converted into something physical, right?

329
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:31,548
Dr. Gray / Mr. Duff (PVM): This is possible.

330
00:14:32,109 --> 00:14:33,710
Dr. Gray / Mr. Duff (PVM): Like hysterical numbness or paralysis.

331
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,754
Dr. Gray / Esther OR Mr. Duff (PVM): Maybe there is no physiological reason, and he's just having a conversion reaction.

332
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:39,235
Mr. Duff / Esther OR Mr. Duff (PVM): You think it's psychosomatic?

333
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:40,937
Dr. Gray / Esther (PVM): It is not in your head, man.

334
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:42,019
Dr. Gray / Esther (PVM): I believe you.

335
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,801
Dr. Gray / Mr. Duff (PVM): Mr. Duff, please.

336
00:14:46,024 --> 00:14:46,543
Mr. Duff / Mr. Duff (PVM): What was that?

337
00:14:47,306 --> 00:14:48,147
Dr. Gray / Mr. Duff (PVM): Psych sent him down.

338
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,028
Dr. Gray / Mr. Duff (PVM): He has visions.

339
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:49,889
Mr. Duff / Cricket (PVM): Is that it?

340
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:51,408
Mr. Duff / Dr. Jennings OR Cricket (PVM): Am I crazy?

341
00:14:52,552 --> 00:14:53,231
Dr. Gray / Dr. Jennings (PVM): No, no.

342
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:56,316
Dr. Gray / Dr. Jennings (PVM): I'm going to order a higher level MRI.

343
00:14:57,341 --> 00:14:58,302
Dr. Gray / Dr. Jennings (PVM): We're going to figure this out.

344
00:15:04,134 --> 00:15:05,697
Mr. Walker's wife / Esther (PVM): You know how important this is to me.

345
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:07,480
Mr. Walker's wife / Esther OR Dr. Jennings (PVM): This is about saving your life, sweetie.

346
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,683
Mr. Walker's wife / Esther OR Dr. Jennings (PVM): And you're not respecting it, or me.

347
00:15:10,245 --> 00:15:18,422
Mr. Walker / Esther (PVM): You're letting them put a pig, a freaking non-kosher trade mammal, into my chest, into my heart, the very essence of my being.

348
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:20,336
Dr. Gray / Devo OR Esther (PVM): It's a porcine valve, actually.

349
00:15:20,355 --> 00:15:21,716
Mr. Walker / Esther (PVM): I don't care what the hell it is.

350
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,182
Mr. Walker / Esther (PVM): If you give me a pig part, I might as well be dead.

351
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,625
Devo's Parent / Devo OR Cricket (PVM): I told you this whole Orthodox thing was a mistake.

352
00:15:26,644 --> 00:15:29,588
Devo's Parent / Cricket (PVM): What was so wrong with being clean or reformed like everyone else we know?

353
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:31,892
Devo / Esther (PVM): You guys don't even light candles Friday nights.

354
00:15:32,373 --> 00:15:34,394
Devo / Esther (PVM): You don't even know all the Passover plagues.

355
00:15:34,696 --> 00:15:37,077
Devo / Devo OR Devo (PVM): Boils, vermin, pestilence, even I know that.

356
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,466
Attending Doctor / Dr. Karev (PVM): Miss Freeman, I appreciate your extreme religious convictions.

357
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:44,827
Devo / Dr. Karev (PVM): Fire, hail, slain, firstborn.

358
00:15:44,849 --> 00:15:47,633
Attending Doctor / Dr. Karev (PVM): But simply put, without this procedure, you will die.

359
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:50,773
Esther: You're hot shot, doctors.

360
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:52,315
Esther: You'll come up with something else.

361
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:57,061
Esther: As long as it doesn't answer to Wilbur and say oink, I don't care what it is.

362
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:09,115
Devo / Esther (PVM): Your nostrils are flaring.

363
00:16:09,956 --> 00:16:10,378
Doctor / Mr. Duff (PVM): They are not.

364
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:11,340
Devo / Esther (PVM): You're into me.

365
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:11,879
Devo / Esther (PVM): I can tell.

366
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,147
Esther: Dr. Small and Angry was a hot appetizer, but you, Doc, are a smorgasbord of lust.

367
00:16:17,245 --> 00:16:18,649
Doctor / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Mr. Doff, you're pressing your luck.

368
00:16:19,201 --> 00:16:20,124
Esther: Would you press it for me?

369
00:16:21,745 --> 00:16:22,846
Doctor / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): I hope you're not claustrophobic.

370
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:27,091
Devo / Mr. Duff OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): You're staring at me.

371
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:27,812
Doctor / Esther (PVM): Stop.

372
00:16:28,312 --> 00:16:30,474
Esther: I'm looking at you, sweetheart, but it's the strangest thing.

373
00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:32,975
Esther: I'm hungry for a chocolate cupcake.

374
00:16:33,777 --> 00:16:34,317
Doctor / Mr. Duff (PVM): What did you say?

375
00:16:34,356 --> 00:16:35,879
Esther: A chocolate cupcake?

376
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,663
Mr. Duff: Maybe one of those fudgy things with the white squiggle on the frosting.

377
00:16:39,883 --> 00:16:40,403
Mr. Duff: Could you oblige?

378
00:16:42,846 --> 00:16:43,005
Dr. Jennings: What?

379
00:16:43,826 --> 00:16:46,509
Mr. Duff: Do I still have some chocolate on my face or in my hair or something?

380
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:48,774
Dr. Jennings: What are you talking about?

381
00:16:49,254 --> 00:16:49,336
Mr. Duff: You.

382
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:50,840
Dr. Jennings: I know the drill, so keep it up.

383
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,466
Dr. Jennings: Next, you'll be reading my cards, telling me my dead uncle is in the room.

384
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:56,572
Mr. Duff: Is he?

385
00:16:57,335 --> 00:16:58,216
Dr. Jennings: I don't have a dead uncle.

386
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,454
Mr. Duff: I'm watching you.

387
00:17:15,192 --> 00:17:16,682
Mr. Duff: If that's turkey, can I have some?

388
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:17,002
Dr. Jennings: It's soggy.

389
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:18,432
Doctor / Mr. Duff (PVM): It'll kill you to solve everything.

390
00:17:18,934 --> 00:17:20,163
George / Mr. Duff (PVM): I could have gotten that intubation.

391
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:21,810
George / Mr. Duff (PVM): I am good at intubations.

392
00:17:22,602 --> 00:17:25,423

393
00:17:25,443 --> 00:17:26,807

394

397
00:17:29,209 --> 00:17:30,009

398
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:31,832

399
00:17:32,413 --> 00:17:33,173

405
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:42,403

Mrs. Glass / Mrs. Glass (PVM): Would have actually given up on the whole kid thing about a year ago.

424
00:18:42,324 --> 00:18:44,066

425
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:45,125
Doctor / Mrs. Glass (PVM): You get it, right?

426
00:18:46,288 --> 00:18:47,028
Patient / Mrs. Glass (PVM): My hesitation.

427
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,632
Patient / Mrs. Glass (PVM): This isn't an easy decision.

428
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:51,874
Patient / Mrs. Glass (PVM): I mean, I'm having a baby.

429
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,131

431
00:18:56,913 --> 00:19:00,019

432
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,222
Doctor / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Forgo treatment.

433
00:19:01,522 --> 00:19:03,749

434
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:06,074

436
00:19:27,105 --> 00:19:27,625
Patient / Dr. Jennings (PVM): Where's my fingers?

437
00:19:28,188 --> 00:19:29,891
Patient / Dr. Jennings OR Cricket (PVM): I can't.

438
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:30,692
Doctor / Dr. Jennings (PVM): Right here.

439
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:30,991
Doctor / Dr. Jennings (PVM): No?

440
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:38,027
Doctor / Dr. Jennings (PVM): Let me know if you feel this.

441
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:39,307
Doctor / Dr. Jennings (PVM): Anything here?

442
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:39,890
Doctor / Dr. Jennings (PVM): Up here?

443
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:40,570
Doctor / Dr. Jennings OR Mr. Duff (PVM): OK.

444
00:19:40,592 --> 00:19:41,353
Doctor / Dr. Jennings (PVM): Nothing on this side?

445
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:43,457
Doctor / Dr. Jennings (PVM): All right, I'll be right back.

446
00:19:43,477 --> 00:19:44,940
Dr. Jennings: Nurse, cancel the second MRI.

447
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:46,583
Dr. Jennings: Call down and prep OR staff.

448
00:19:47,845 --> 00:19:48,644
Nurse / Mr. Duff (PVM): You're operating?

449
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:49,927
Nurse / Mr. Duff (PVM): On what?

450
00:19:50,307 --> 00:19:52,089
Doctor / Mr. Duff (PVM): If there was something to fix, wouldn't we have seen it?

451
00:19:52,111 --> 00:19:54,173
Attending Surgeon / Patient (PVM): I think the MRI missed a clot somewhere in his upper spine.

452
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:55,615
Attending Surgeon / Patient (PVM): I'm going to cut him open.

453
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:56,056
Attending Surgeon / Patient (PVM): I'm going in.

454
00:19:56,576 --> 00:19:57,356
Meredith Grey / Mr. Duff (PVM): What if you're wrong?

455
00:19:57,857 --> 00:20:00,382
Meredith Grey / Patient OR Mr. Duff (PVM): Couldn't unnecessary spinal surgery do more damage?

456
00:20:00,422 --> 00:20:04,748
Attending Surgeon / Patient (PVM): If we wait any longer and this thing expands into his brain stem, we have a paralyzed man who can't breathe.

457
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:05,729
Attending Surgeon / Patient (PVM): I'm trusting my instincts.

458
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:07,810
Attending Surgeon / Patient (PVM): Sometimes you've got to take a chance to save a life.

459
00:20:15,942 --> 00:20:22,796
Doctor (possibly Cristina Yang) / Dr. Jennings OR Devo (PVM): Your mitral regurg is getting worse.

460
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,981
Doctor (possibly Cristina Yang) / Devo (PVM): The valves are leakier than ever.

461
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:31,836
Patient (Teenager) / Devo OR Esther (PVM): Are you hitting on me?

462
00:20:32,557 --> 00:20:33,156
Doctor (possibly Cristina Yang) / Devo (PVM): You want me to?

463
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,824
Patient (Teenager) / Esther (PVM): I hear they call you Dr. Evilsbaum.

464
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:37,653
Doctor (possibly Cristina Yang) / Devo (PVM): Only the people that like me.

465
00:20:38,493 --> 00:20:40,356
Patient (Teenager) / Devo (PVM): I guess that explains the lack of faith thing.

466
00:20:40,376 --> 00:20:45,925
Doctor (possibly Cristina Yang) / Devo OR Devo (PVM): Well, I kind of think of myself as a pagan, but, uh, hey, that's just me.

467
00:20:49,892 --> 00:20:51,815
Patient (Teenager) / Esther (PVM): You know what it's like being a teenager these days?

468
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:55,961
Patient (Teenager) / Esther (PVM): My friends spend most of their time screwing around and getting wasted.

469
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,265
Patient (Teenager) / Devo OR Esther (PVM): At least I have God.

470
00:20:58,403 --> 00:21:02,289
Doctor (possibly Cristina Yang) / Devo (PVM): Well, so God wants you to die, huh?

471
00:21:03,413 --> 00:21:05,674
Patient (Teenager) / Esther (PVM): He wants me to be passionate about what I believe in.

472
00:21:06,953 --> 00:21:08,174
Doctor (possibly Cristina Yang) / Esther (PVM): You don't believe in anything.

473
00:21:09,656 --> 00:21:10,920
Doctor (possibly Cristina Yang) / Devo (PVM): No, my mother used to pray to St.

474
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,161
Doctor (possibly Cristina Yang) / Devo OR Esther (PVM): Jude for me.

475
00:21:12,181 --> 00:21:13,060
Patient (Teenager) / Esther (PVM): How appropriate.

476
00:21:14,182 --> 00:21:15,625
Cristina Yang / Esther (PVM): Patron saint of lost causes.

477
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:17,307
George O'Malley / Unknown (PVM): Oh.

478
00:21:20,971 --> 00:21:21,791
Izzie Stevens / Mrs. Glass (PVM): The fate of Kurt Cobain.

479
00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:26,597
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): I did an angio on my side case.

480
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,102
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): The MRI came out clean, but I saw a digital.

481
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:29,942
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): There's something here.

482
00:21:31,463 --> 00:21:31,545
Meredith Grey / Dr. Jennings (PVM): Yep.

483
00:21:32,182 --> 00:21:34,403
Meredith Grey / Dr. Jennings OR Dr. Jennings (PVM): You're right, there's an AVM on his left temporal lobe.

484
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:36,086
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): I'll schedule the OR for tonight, then.

485
00:21:36,826 --> 00:21:37,689
Meredith Grey / Dr. Jennings (PVM): Oh, back up, girl.

486
00:21:38,328 --> 00:21:40,070
Meredith Grey / Dr. Jennings (PVM): There's high risk of spontaneous hemorrhage.

487
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:41,432
Meredith Grey / Dr. Jennings (PVM): The attending has to see the films.

488
00:21:41,471 --> 00:21:42,574
Meredith Grey / Dr. Jennings (PVM): We need consent forms.

489
00:21:42,894 --> 00:21:45,155
Alex Karev / Dr. Jennings (PVM): Believe it or not, Stevens, we have to follow protocol.

490
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:45,677
Meredith Grey / Dr. Jennings (PVM): Take a breath.

491
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:48,220
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Jennings (PVM): But if the AVM looks like it's going to blow, we fix it, right?

492
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,364
Alex Karev / Dr. Jennings OR Dr. Jennings (PVM): If the man needs to be fixed, we'll fix him in due time.

493
00:21:51,403 --> 00:21:52,625
Alex Karev / Dr. Jennings (PVM): Why are you moving so quickly?

494
00:21:53,306 --> 00:21:56,647
Alex Karev / Dr. Jennings (PVM): You get too involved with your patients, Izzy.

495
00:21:56,669 --> 00:21:58,131
Alex Karev / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Jennings (PVM): Why do you make everything so personal?

496
00:21:59,172 --> 00:22:00,011
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): It's not personal.

497
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:03,105
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): It's not.

498
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:09,894
George O'Malley / Dr. Jennings OR Patient OR Mr. Duff OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): I've got to save this cord.

499
00:22:10,757 --> 00:22:13,661
Alex Karev / Dr. Jennings OR Patient OR Mr. Duff OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): This guy is built like the rock of Gibraltar.

500
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:14,422
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You want me to start?

501
00:22:14,942 --> 00:22:17,967
Dr. Karev / Patient OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): No, I'm going to cut here from the base of the neck to the rib cage.

502
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:20,430
Dr. Karev / Patient (PVM): I want you to hit the bleeders.

503
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:23,634
Dr. O'Malley / Patient OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I still don't think we should be doing this.

504
00:22:25,237 --> 00:22:26,759
Dr. Karev / Patient OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): This guy has a spinal hematoma.

505
00:22:26,877 --> 00:22:27,740
Dr. O'Malley / Patient OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): We don't know that.

506
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,962
Dr. Karev / Patient OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Which left untreated are almost always fatal.

507
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:30,943
Dr. O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You're cutting blind.

508
00:22:31,144 --> 00:22:32,665
Dr. O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Whatever happened to being practical?

509
00:22:33,126 --> 00:22:34,028
Dr. Karev / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I need to see more here.

510
00:22:34,107 --> 00:22:34,990
Dr. Karev / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Tractor.

511
00:22:37,813 --> 00:22:38,173
Dr. O'Malley / Mr. Duff OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Wow.

512
00:22:38,973 --> 00:22:39,615
Dr. Karev / Mr. Duff (PVM): Good cap refill.

513
00:22:39,996 --> 00:22:40,717
Dr. Karev / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): The spine.

514
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:50,750
Dr. O'Malley / Mr. Duff OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): There is no wow in practical.

515
00:22:52,112 --> 00:22:54,012
Dr. Bailey / Mr. Duff OR Mrs. Glass (PVM): We've decided to go ahead with the evacuation.

516
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:57,817
Dr. Karev / Mr. Duff OR Mr. Duff OR Mrs. Glass (PVM): What the hell, right?

517
00:22:57,837 --> 00:22:59,480
Dr. Karev / Mrs. Glass (PVM): Maybe this is how it's supposed to be.

518
00:23:00,522 --> 00:23:02,047
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Jennings (PVM): We need to start chemo right away, then.

519
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:03,228
Dr. Stevens / Dr. Jennings (PVM): We'll get everything ready.

520
00:23:08,217 --> 00:23:09,499
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Jennings (PVM): You ever done a DNC before?

521
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,661
Dr. Stevens / Dr. Jennings (PVM): We learn at school.

522
00:23:11,461 --> 00:23:12,903
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Jennings (PVM): OK, go ahead.

523
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:15,910
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Jennings (PVM): I'll call an OP resident down to supervise.

524
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,991
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Jennings (PVM): If she needs anything, page me.

525
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,903
Dr. Karev / Patient (PVM): You're using up my oxygen, O'Malley.

526
00:23:39,923 --> 00:23:43,768
Cristina Yang / Patient OR Patient (PVM): How does a pompous cocky jackass like you always have women all over him?

527
00:23:44,969 --> 00:23:45,890
Alex Karev / Devo (PVM): Little blue love pills.

528
00:23:46,568 --> 00:23:48,230
Alex Karev / Patient OR Devo (PVM): Lots of them.

529
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,294
Cristina Yang / Devo (PVM): Come on.

530
00:23:50,314 --> 00:23:52,335
Alex Karev / Devo (PVM): Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.

531
00:23:54,115 --> 00:23:54,537
Meredith Grey / Devo (PVM): There it is.

532
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:57,038
Attending Surgeon / Devo (PVM): A bovine xenograft.

533
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,502
Alex Karev / Devo OR Patient (PVM): O'Malley, you think too much.

534
00:24:02,923 --> 00:24:03,585
Alex Karev / Patient (PVM): Can't you see it?

535
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,486
Alex Karev / Patient (PVM): You got to dance and jab.

536
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:07,268
Alex Karev / Patient (PVM): Dance and jab.

537
00:24:07,535 --> 00:24:08,194
Alex Karev / Patient (PVM): Like me.

538
00:24:08,817 --> 00:24:10,459
Alex Karev / Patient (PVM): I am the Ali of this place.

539
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:28,884
George O'Malley / Devo OR Devo (PVM): Does the wall ever bow back?

540
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:39,548
Cristina Yang / Esther (PVM): It's called davening, smartass.

541
00:24:40,352 --> 00:24:43,457
Cristina Yang / Esther (PVM): This is me communing with God, and you're interrupting.

542
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:45,720
Izzie Stevens / Devo OR Patient (PVM): I've found a transplant option.

543
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,865
Izzie Stevens / Devo OR Patient (PVM): At first, I thought maybe a cadaver, but they're really hard to find.

544
00:24:50,646 --> 00:24:55,375
Izzie Stevens / Devo (PVM): And then I realized Dr. Burke can transplant a bovine mitral valve instead of the pig.

545
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:57,156
Patient's Family Member / Devo (PVM): She can get a cow valve?

546
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,103
Patient's Family Member / Dr. Jennings (PVM): Dr. Burke, why wasn't this mentioned before?

547
00:25:00,942 --> 00:25:03,548
Dr. Burke / Devo OR Devo OR Dr. Jennings (PVM): The divine valve has only been an option the last few years.

548
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:05,691
Dr. Burke / Devo (PVM): And it's a much more complicated procedure.

549
00:25:05,711 --> 00:25:08,875
Dr. Burke / Devo (PVM): But the best part is it's actually superior to the pig.

550
00:25:08,894 --> 00:25:09,497
Dr. Burke / Devo (PVM): It lasts longer.

551
00:25:09,537 --> 00:25:14,565
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Karev (PVM): What incredibly small fraction of your brain were you using there?

552
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:15,326
Alex Karev / Mr. Duff (PVM): What?

553
00:25:15,665 --> 00:25:20,272
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Karev (PVM): Correct me if I'm wrong, but did you not present an alternative procedure without consulting your attending first?

554
00:25:20,574 --> 00:25:21,756
Alex Karev / Dr. Karev (PVM): I thought you'd be... What, impressed?

555
00:25:22,477 --> 00:25:23,298
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Karev (PVM): That's just stupid.

556
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,338
Alex Karev / Dr. Karev (PVM): I'm sorry.

557
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:25,300
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Karev (PVM): We're finished here, Karev.

558
00:25:25,842 --> 00:25:26,884
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Karev (PVM): You're off this case.

559
00:25:42,404 --> 00:25:45,607
Dr. Alex Karev / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): You need to sign these consent forms so we can proceed with your surgery.

560
00:25:46,367 --> 00:25:50,451
Patient (possibly a comedic or stubborn patient) / Esther (PVM): Sweetheart, I'm not signing anything unless it's got my name on it, followed by a whole bunch of zeros.

561
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:53,894
Dr. Alex Karev / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Look, the AVM is located in this crucial part of the brain.

562
00:25:53,954 --> 00:25:57,798
Dr. Alex Karev / Mr. Duff OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): It's a tangle of blood vessels that could burst and affect your speech, among other things.

563
00:25:57,877 --> 00:26:00,161
Dr. Alex Karev / Mr. Duff (PVM): So we know your visions are actually seizures.

564
00:26:00,402 --> 00:26:00,701
Patient / Mr. Duff (PVM): Do you?

565
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,583
Dr. Alex Karev / Mr. Duff (PVM): Do I what?

566
00:26:02,844 --> 00:26:03,624
Patient / Mr. Duff (PVM): Know they're seizures.

567
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:06,945
Patient / Mr. Duff OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): You're really good at reading people, aren't you?

568
00:26:07,626 --> 00:26:08,689
Patient / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Telling them what they want to hear.

569
00:26:09,347 --> 00:26:12,310
Patient / Esther (PVM): There's a really unfortunate alignment of Saturn in the house of Jupiter right now.

570
00:26:13,979 --> 00:26:15,961
Dr. Alex Karev / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Okay, I know what you're doing.

571
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,183
Dr. Alex Karev / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): You watch people, read their body language.

572
00:26:19,605 --> 00:26:23,269
Dr. Alex Karev / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): You say chocolate cupcakes, I lean towards you, so you think you're on the right track.

573
00:26:23,611 --> 00:26:25,932
Dr. Alex Karev / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Not only do you know you're having seizures, but you're milking it.

574
00:26:28,596 --> 00:26:31,480
Patient / Patient (PVM): Well, we'll just see about that, Cricket.

575
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:32,319
Dr. Alex Karev / Mr. Duff (PVM): What?

576
00:26:34,002 --> 00:26:35,243
Mrs. Glass / Mr. Duff OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): What did you just call me?

577
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:42,476
