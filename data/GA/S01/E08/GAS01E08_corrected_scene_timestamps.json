In the kitchen, Izzie Stevens is frustrated after baking cupcakes for eight hours, eating chocolate, and still feeling something is missing from her recipe. Meredith reassures her that the cupcakes taste good, while Cristina Yang jokes that Martha Stewart would be proud. Izzie laments her situation, and Meredith continues her narration about losing faith in childhood myths like Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy. Cristina suggests Izzie call her mother for advice about the missing ingredient, but Izzie refuses. Cristina then proposes that they sleep at Izzie\u2019s house instead of hers, questioning whether Meredith even has a home with her own belongings.
