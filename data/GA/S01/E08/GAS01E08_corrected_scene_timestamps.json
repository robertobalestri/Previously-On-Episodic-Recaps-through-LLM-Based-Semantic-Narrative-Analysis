She reflects on how growing up leads to the loss of these fantasies, but a small part of hope remains. In the kitchen, Izzie Stevens bakes cupcakes, frustrated that she can't replicate the taste from her childhood. Meredith and Cristina Yang taste the cupcakes; Cristina jokes that Martha Stewart would be proud, but Izzie insists something is missing and refuses to call her mother for the recipe, despite encouragement from the others. Cristina suggests they sleep at Izzie's place for a change, leading to playful banter about whose house is more of a home and teasing about Meredith's morning muesli habit. Their conversation is light but hints at the closeness and complexities of their friendships. As morning arrives, Izzie offers cupcakes to the group, and Meredith\u2019s narration continues, noting that even as people grow up and lose faith in fairy tales, most still hold onto a bit of hope that their dreams might come true.",
