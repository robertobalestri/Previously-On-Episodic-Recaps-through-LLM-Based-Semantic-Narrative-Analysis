A voice urged Meredith Grey to wake up as she drifted in and out of exhaustion, her thoughts swirling with memories of childhood fears and the heavier burdens of adulthood. Meredith had not slept in forty-eight hours, and now, on top of missing her hospital rounds, she faced her first opportunity to assist in heart surgery. Meanwhile, a lawyer explained to Meredith that, because her mother's Alzheimer's was advancing, it was imperative to have her mother sign over her estate while she was still lucid. Overwhelmed, Meredith hesitated, asking if someone else could handle it, but the lawyer insisted it was her duty as her mother's child.

As Meredith's internal monologue continued, she reflected on the responsibilities of adulthood—earning a living, paying rent, and, as a surgeon, literally holding a human heart in her hands. In the operating room, a nurse addressed Dr. Grey, prompting her to apologize for letting something slip from her hands. Another surgeon instructed Meredith to gently release Mrs. Patterson's heart as the team prepared to take the patient off bypass. Meredith's thoughts compared the gravity of this responsibility to the simpler worries of her youth.

Later, in the hospital lounge, several interns discussed their desire to hold a heart during surgery. One boasted that even a monkey could do it. George was sent to fetch more ice and chips as the conversation shifted to a party supposedly happening at Meredith's house. There was confusion over whether Meredith was aware of the party, with someone denying any knowledge of it. Back in the operating room, the team grew concerned about Mrs. Patterson's condition after surgery, but after tense moments, they managed to restore her heart rhythm.

Meredith's internal monologue returned, focusing on the fear of letting responsibility slip through her fingers. In a corridor, a colleague congratulated Meredith on participating in heart surgery with Dr. Burke, remarking on the unforgettable sensation of holding a heart. Afterward, Meredith confided in George, worried that she might have damaged Mrs. Patterson's heart during the procedure. George reassured her that the patient was stable and advised her not to mention it to Dr. Burke since nothing had happened.

Elsewhere, a group of medical staff reviewed a patient's X-ray. George described hyperinflated lungs with diminished capacity, and the team discussed the need for a bulectomy, cautioning against anti-smoking lectures. In another exam room, a patient complained of severe back pain and requested specific pain medications. The staff suspected drug-seeking behavior but were reminded to treat all pain as real. A central line was ordered due to the patient's poor veins.

Mrs. Drake, another patient, spoke about her struggle to quit smoking and her ongoing pain, feeling that no one believed her suffering was real. A young doctor reassured her after reviewing her films, and Mrs. Drake asked if the upcoming surgery would finally help. She commented on the doctor's youthful appearance, but the doctor insisted they were older than they looked.

A doctor checked on Mr. Patterson, inquiring about his wife's stability after heart surgery and offering reassurance. In another room, a doctor prepared to discharge Mr. Sturman, who joked about never wanting a bowel obstruction again. Mr. Sturman revealed he had attended medical school but dropped out to pursue research and start a family, advising the doctor that a physician's first responsibility is always to the patient.

During Mrs. Drake's surgery, the team performed a spaghetti procedure and discovered a towel left inside her chest from a previous operation five years earlier. The attending instructed Cristina to research the earlier surgery and find out who was responsible, while George was told to stay with the patient. Cristina asked George if she was invited to the party, and he awkwardly said yes.

Meanwhile, someone ordered beer and snacks for the party, pretending it was for office supplies. Another person bargained for an invitation in exchange for help. In the hospital, Mr. Frost became agitated about his care. A doctor was reprimanded for questioning orders and told to start a central line for Mr. Frost, who had a history of addiction but also real pain.

Mrs. Drake was informed by a doctor that a towel had been left inside her during her previous surgery. Shocked, she asked how such a mistake could happen. George tried to comfort her, but she was understandably upset.

A doctor was instructed to keep the towel incident confidential while the hospital addressed it. Dr. Stevens was paged to call the CCU. Another character checked on a colleague who seemed upset after a long surgery and invited them to dinner, but the invitation was declined due to the party. As they discussed the party, Mrs. Patterson suddenly developed swelling and bleeding at her surgical site. The team responded urgently, and a doctor confessed to possibly nicking the heart during surgery.

In the operating room, the attending surgeon was furious that the possible error had not been reported earlier. The team worked to repair the damage. The chief surgeon demanded copies of the patient's chart and scheduled a meeting with legal for the next morning, warning the doctors to be prepared to explain what happened.

In the break room, the interns discussed the upcoming meeting with the chief and the risk of being expelled from the program. One was upset that another had confessed to the attending. The conversation shifted to party logistics, with concerns about the guest list and whether Meredith knew about the party. Someone insisted they had nothing to do with organizing it.

At a care facility, Meredith arrived late for a meeting to sign legal papers for her mother. The notary and others were present, but her mother was not lucid and was preoccupied with work. The facility's physician explained that her mother was ‘sundowning' and unable to sign. Meredith was told to return another day when her mother was lucid, and there was tension about why the process had been delayed.

That night, the party at Meredith's house was in full swing. Someone threatened Izzy about the chaos, and another was warned not to touch something or risk trouble. There was a brief conversation about an issue being ‘taken care of' and not to be discussed further. Someone asked for bourbon.

Back at the hospital, Mr. Frost resisted being discharged and demanded more pain medication. As staff attempted to remove him, he fell and suffered a head injury. Medical staff responded, noting a blown pupil and ordering a CT scan, which revealed a subdural bleed with midline shift. Emergency brain surgery was planned, and Dr. Stevens was invited to assist.

At the party, Meredith was overwhelmed by the number of guests and realized Izzy had not cleared the party with her. Meredith considered kicking everyone out but was distracted by the arrival of Izzy's boyfriend, Hank. Meredith greeted Hank, offered him tequila, and explained the demands of being an intern. Hank was frustrated by Izzy's absence and the unexpected party.

At the hospital, Dr. Stevens and Alex discussed who would monitor a patient in recovery. Alex offered to take over so Stevens could see her boyfriend, and Stevens thanked him. Later, Izzy arrived home and apologized to Hank for not calling, explaining she had been needed for brain surgery. Hank was upset about the party and Izzy's priorities. Izzy tried to explain her commitment to her work, but Hank left, saying he would call her.

At the party, Meredith drank and reflected on her life. Outside, she interacted with Derek, joking about tequila. They shared a flirtatious moment and discussed sneaking around, but their conversation was interrupted by someone asking them to move a car.

The next morning, Meredith prepared for her meeting with the chief, surveying the mess left behind by the party. Izzy apologized for the chaos, but Meredith was more concerned about the upcoming meeting regarding the surgical error. Meredith and another intern discussed Mrs. Patterson's significant weight loss and its impact on muscle mass, possibly explaining the surgical complication.

In the chief's office, Meredith presented her research on the patient's weight loss and its effect on heart muscle. The chief and legal counsel noted that Meredith's late reporting of the error left the hospital open to liability. Dr. Burke admitted to a past mistake of leaving a towel inside a patient and not reporting it out of fear for his career. He argued that doctors must be able to speak up about mistakes without fear of retribution. The chief acknowledged this and noted that Meredith did eventually come forward.

After the meeting, Meredith told her friends she had received one month of probation. She thanked Burke for supporting her. The group discussed the towel incident and the importance of timing when reporting mistakes. Meredith's internal monologue reflected on the burden of responsibility.

In the hospital, a social worker named Sloan was introduced to Jerry, the patient with addiction issues, to discuss rehab options. Meredith apologized to Mrs. Drake for the towel incident. Another patient celebrated having a bowel movement after surgery. Meredith's internal monologue continued, reflecting on how responsibility cannot be avoided and must be faced.

In the final scenes, the characters reflected on missing the party and the realities of life as a surgeon. Meredith and a colleague shared a moment, acknowledging the challenges and perks of adulthood, such as independence and freedom from parental control. The episode ended with Meredith accepting the weight of adult responsibilities.
