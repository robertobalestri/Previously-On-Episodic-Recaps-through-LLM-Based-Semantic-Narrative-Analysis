Meredith Grey awoke contemplating the simplicity of childhood worries compared to the overwhelming responsibilities of adulthood. As a surgical intern, Meredith found herself facing tasks as daunting as holding a human heart in her hands. Her morning grew more complicated when a lawyer informed her that her mother, Ellis Grey, was experiencing rapid advancement of Alzheimer's disease. While Ellis was still lucid, she needed to sign her estate over to Meredith. Exhausted from forty-eight hours without sleep and anxious about her first heart surgery, Meredith pleaded for someone else to handle her mother's affairs, but the lawyer insisted it was her responsibility.

During heart surgery, Dr. Burke guided Meredith through the delicate process of releasing Mrs. Patterson's heart. Meredith's hands slipped, prompting an apology, but the procedure continued. Burke instructed the team to warm Mrs. Patterson and take her off bypass. Meredith reflected on how the weight of such responsibility made childhood seem appealing.

After the operation, Izzie Stevens expressed envy over Meredith's opportunity to hold a heart, while Cristina Yang joked that even a monkey could do it. The interns discussed a party planned at Meredith's house, with Cristina and Izzie debating the guest list and Izzie's boyfriend Hank's reputation. Alex Karev and George O'Malley joined the conversation, and Meredith was surprised to learn about the party, insisting she had no idea it was happening.

Back in the operating room, Mrs. Patterson's heart struggled to restart. Burke led the team through compressions and defibrillation until her heart rhythm was restored. Meredith, anxious that she may have damaged the heart during surgery, confessed to George and Izzie that she had nodded off and squeezed the heart, puncturing her glove. George reassured her that Mrs. Patterson was stable and advised her not to tell Burke, but Meredith remained uneasy.

George was assigned to care for Mrs. Drake, a patient suffering from chronic back pain and a history of lung surgery. He and Meredith suspected Mrs. Drake might be addicted to Dilaudid, but Dr. Bailey reminded them to treat her pain seriously. Mrs. Drake shared her struggles with quitting smoking and the skepticism she faced regarding her pain. George comforted her, affirming that her pain was real.

Meanwhile, Mr. Sturman, another patient, joked about never wanting another bowel obstruction and revealed he had dropped out of medical school. He advised Meredith and George that a doctor's first responsibility is always to the patient.

During Mrs. Drake's lung surgery, Burke and Bailey discovered a towel left inside her from a previous operation. Bailey instructed Cristina to investigate who had closed during the initial surgery, while George was tasked with keeping Mrs. Drake happy, as she had taken a liking to him.

Bailey asked George if she was invited to the party, and he awkwardly confirmed. Cristina and Izzie coordinated beer and snacks, debating the guest list and timing, while Alex and Meredith joked about the party invitations.

Mrs. Drake confronted George about the towel, learning that Dr. Weber, the chief, was responsible. Burke instructed the team to keep the discovery quiet while they resolved the issue.

Burke invited Cristina to dinner, suggesting they skip the party and spend time together. Cristina declined, and Burke thanked her for not inviting him, encouraging her to consider dinner in the future.

Suddenly, Mrs. Patterson developed swelling and bleeding over her sternum. Burke, Meredith, and Cristina rushed to stabilize her. Meredith confessed to Burke that she had punctured her glove and may have nicked the heart. Burke was frustrated that Meredith had not spoken up earlier and instructed her to apologize to Mrs. Patterson's husband and review the case history, warning her that her career was at risk.

Meredith feared she could be expelled from the program. Cristina and Izzie debated whether Mrs. Patterson would sue and criticized Meredith for telling Burke. Meredith prepared for a notary appointment regarding her mother's estate, with Bailey and Webber arranging for legal and medical witnesses.

At the party, Izzie and Cristina argued about the guest list and Izzie's relationship with Hank. Meredith arrived late to the notary meeting with Ellis Grey, who was confused and unable to sign the papers due to sundowning. The team realized they should have scheduled the meeting earlier in the day.

Alex and Izzie dealt with Jerry Frost, a patient addicted to pain medication. Alex tried to discharge Jerry, but Jerry resisted, demanding more drugs. During a struggle, Jerry fell and suffered a subdural bleed. Cristina and Alex rushed him to CT, and Dr. Shepherd invited Izzie to assist in brain surgery.

At the party, Meredith was overwhelmed by the number of guests. She and Cristina tried to manage the chaos, and Alex offered to kick everyone out. Meredith decided to let the party continue. Hank arrived, frustrated by the crowd and Meredith's absence. Meredith explained her commitment to her job and patients, but Hank felt neglected.

Later, Meredith and Derek Shepherd talked outside. Derek joked about being blown off for tequila, and Meredith asked him to take her for a ride. They agreed the party was winding down and shared a moment before sneaking back inside.

The next morning, Meredith prepared for her meeting with the chief. Cristina apologized for the party getting out of hand. Burke reviewed Mrs. Patterson's case, questioning the cause of her heart wall tearing. Meredith explained that the patient's rapid weight loss had led to muscle loss, including heart muscle, making the heart vulnerable. The hospital administrator criticized Meredith for not reporting the glove puncture immediately, exposing the hospital to liability.

Burke defended Meredith, sharing his own past mistake of leaving a towel in a patient and not reporting it out of fear. He argued that doctors must be able to speak up about errors without fear of repercussions. Meredith was placed on one month probation.

Cristina and Izzie supported Meredith, noting that Burke had saved her. Bailey urged everyone to get back to work. Cristina observed that Burke was always going to report the towel incident, emphasizing that information is power.

Jerry Frost was offered rehab options. Meredith apologized to Mrs. Drake for the towel incident, and Mr. Sturman celebrated his recovery. The interns reflected on missing the party and the challenges of life as surgeons. Meredith concluded that while responsibility was difficult, adulthood offered freedom and independence.
