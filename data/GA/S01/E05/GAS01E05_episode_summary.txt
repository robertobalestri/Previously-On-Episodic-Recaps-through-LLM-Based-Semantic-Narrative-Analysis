Meredith Grey began her day reflecting on the overwhelming responsibilities of adulthood, especially as a surgical intern, and how these burdens made her long for the simpler worries of childhood. Her morning took a difficult turn when a lawyer approached her with news that her mother's Alzheimer's disease was advancing. The lawyer explained that while her mother was still lucid enough to consent, she needed to sign over her estate to Meredith. Feeling overwhelmed, Meredith protested and asked if someone else could handle the matter, but the lawyer insisted that, as her daughter, the responsibility was hers alone.

At the hospital, Meredith prepared for her first heart surgery, exhausted from lack of sleep and missing rounds. During the procedure, she was given the critical task of holding Mrs. Patterson's heart. Her hands slipped, but Dr. Burke, the attending surgeon, calmly instructed her to gently release the heart and finish the procedure. Internally, Meredith compared the gravity of this responsibility to the trivial concerns she had as a child.

After the surgery, Cristina Yang expressed envy that Meredith had been allowed to hold a heart, joking that even a monkey could do it. The interns, including Cristina and Izzie Stevens, discussed an upcoming party at Meredith's house. Izzie wanted her boyfriend Hank to meet her friends, but Cristina teased her about the party and Hank's sexual prowess. Alex Karev and George O'Malley joined the conversation, and it became clear that the party was growing beyond Meredith's knowledge or approval.

Later, the surgical team faced a crisis when Mrs. Patterson's heart stopped responding after surgery. Dr. Burke led the team in resuscitating her, eventually restoring her rhythm. Meredith, anxious that she might have damaged the heart during surgery, confessed to George that she had nodded off and may have squeezed it or punctured it with her fingernail. George reassured her that Mrs. Patterson was stable and that nothing had happened.

Meanwhile, George was assigned to care for Mrs. Drake, a patient with chronic back pain and a history of lung surgery. George suspected another patient, Jerry Frost, of being a drug seeker, but an attending reminded him that pain must be treated as real regardless of suspicion. Alex was tasked with starting a central line on Jerry, whose veins were damaged from previous treatments.

During Mrs. Drake's surgery, the team discovered a towel left inside her from a previous operation five years earlier. Cristina and George were assigned to investigate who was responsible for the oversight. Mrs. Drake was upset when she learned about the towel, and Cristina was instructed by a senior doctor to keep the matter quiet while it was sorted out.

Izzie and Alex had a tense exchange about the party and their relationship. Alex asked Izzie to dinner, but she declined, citing the party. Alex was annoyed about not being invited. Meanwhile, Meredith was called away to deal with her mother's legal paperwork, leaving party preparations to her friends.

Back at the hospital, Mrs. Patterson suddenly deteriorated, bleeding from her sternum. Cristina and Nurse Tyler tried to stabilize her as Dr. Burke rushed in. Meredith confessed to Dr. Burke that she might have nicked Mrs. Patterson's heart during surgery. Dr. Burke was frustrated that Meredith had not spoken up sooner, especially since she confessed in front of the patient's husband. Cristina criticized Meredith for her honesty, fearing it would get her kicked out of the program.

As the party at Meredith's house spiraled out of control, Izzie tried to manage the chaos. Meredith returned home late from her failed attempt to get her mother's papers signed, as her mother was confused and unable to consent. Dr. Webber, the chief of surgery, chastised Meredith for not handling her mother's affairs sooner.

At the hospital, Jerry Frost, the drug-seeking patient, tried to avoid discharge by claiming pain. Izzie and Alex forcibly discharged him, but Jerry fell and suffered a subdural bleed, requiring emergency brain surgery. Dr. Shepherd asked Izzie if she wanted to assist, and she agreed, leaving the party behind.

At the party, Meredith was overwhelmed by the number of guests and the chaos. She tried to kick everyone out but was swept up in the revelry. Hank arrived, surprised by the size of the party and frustrated that Izzie was absent. Izzie eventually found Hank outside the hospital, and they argued about her priorities and the demands of her job. Hank left, disappointed.

Later, Meredith and Derek Shepherd shared a quiet moment outside the party, joking about sneaking around and the party winding down. Cristina, Izzie, and George discussed Meredith's impending meeting with the chief, worried about her future in the program.

The next day, Meredith met with Dr. Bailey, Dr. Burke, and Dr. Webber to discuss Mrs. Patterson's case. Meredith admitted her mistake and presented her research, suggesting that Mrs. Patterson's rapid weight loss may have weakened her heart muscle, making it susceptible to injury. Dr. Bailey criticized Meredith for not reporting the incident immediately, but Dr. Burke defended her for eventually speaking up. Dr. Burke also confessed his own past mistake of leaving a towel in a patient and not reporting it out of fear for his career. He argued that doctors must be able to admit mistakes without fear of retribution.

Meredith was placed on one month's probation but was not expelled from the program. Her friends were relieved, and Meredith acknowledged that Dr. Burke had saved her. The episode ended with Meredith reflecting on the burdens and occasional perks of adulthood, as she and her friends resumed their lives as surgical interns, facing the ongoing responsibilities of their chosen profession.
