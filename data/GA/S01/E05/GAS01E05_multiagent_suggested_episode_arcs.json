    "description": "Senior surgeons and residents at Seattle Grace Hospital—including Dr. Preston Burke, Dr. Derek Shepherd, Dr. Addison Montgomery, and Chief Richard Webber—engage in ongoing power struggles and professional rivalries, competing for surgical assignments, recognition, and influence. These dynamics shape the hospital’s hierarchy, affect the distribution of cases, mentorship of interns, and opportunities for advancement, directly impacting patient care and career trajectories. The arrival of new attendings and Chief Webber’s leadership decisions continually shift the balance of power, driving institutional change and defining the culture of the surgical department throughout the season.",
