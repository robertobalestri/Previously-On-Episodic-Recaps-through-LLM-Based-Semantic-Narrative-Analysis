[meredith_grey] is asleep in the shower with a toothbrush.
[meredith_grey] wakes up when her arm slips and continues showering.
Later, [meredith_grey] visits the nursing home where her mother lives.
[meredith_grey] talks about having her mother sign everything over to her while her mother is still clear-minded.
[meredith_grey] watches her mother through the glass and mentions she hasn't slept in 48 hours.
[meredith_grey] has her first heart surgery that morning and is missing rounds.
[meredith_grey] asks if someone else can handle the situation.
The nursing home representative explains they are discussing her mother's estate, finances, and medical care, questioning if [meredith_grey] wants to leave these matters to someone else.
In the operating room, [preston_burke] is placing a stitch.
[meredith_grey] starts to nod off while holding the heart.
[preston_burke] notices and asks [meredith_grey] about it.
[meredith_grey] apologizes, saying the heart slipped, but [preston_burke] is finished, and [meredith_grey] can release [mrs_patterson]'s heart.
As they prepare to take the patient off bypass, [george_omalley] and [cristina_yang] watch from the gallery.
[george_omalley] feels jealous that [meredith_grey] got to hold a heart.
[cristina_yang] believes a monkey could hold a heart.
[george_omalley] thinks [cristina_yang] feels this way because [preston_burke] didn't ask her to assist.
[isobel_stevens] enters looking for [george_omalley], saying she needs more ice and chips.
[george_omalley] is surprised and asks how many people [isobel_stevens] invited.
[cristina_yang] reminds [george_omalley] and [isobel_stevens] the invite list was for 'jocks only,' meaning surgery, trauma, and plastics.
[isobel_stevens] admits she also invited people from pediatrics, whom [cristina_yang] calls preschoolers.
[cristina_yang] jokes that shrinks are next, and when [isobel_stevens] turns away, [cristina_yang] realizes [isobel_stevens] already invited them and says the party is already a failure.
[george_omalley] reminds [isobel_stevens] that [meredith_grey] thinks it's a small, meet-your-boyfriend cocktail event, and asks if [isobel_stevens] got [meredith_grey]'s approval.
[isobel_stevens] admits she didn't but promises to do so.
[cristina_yang] questions why [isobel_stevens] is spending the weekend her boyfriend is in town on a party, assuming it's because he's bad in bed.
[isobel_stevens] denies this and says she just wants him to meet her friends.
[cristina_yang] is called away despite her doubts.
[alex_karev] arrives and inquires about a party at [meredith_grey]'s house, taking [cristina_yang]'s seat.
[cristina_yang], [george_omalley], and [isobel_stevens] deny any party while [alex_karev] observes the surgery below.
In the operating room, an alarm sounds, but the issue is unclear.
The anesthesiologist informs [preston_burke] that the patient's temperature is rising as they massage the heart.
[preston_burke] comments that the heart should be working on its own by now when the patient flatlines.
They continue compressions, and [preston_burke] uses paddles to shock the patient twice, restoring a rhythm.
[preston_burke] praises the team and leaves to scrub out.
[meredith_grey] notices her fingernail has punctured her glove and worries she may have caused a problem.
[derek_shepherd], while eating, approaches [meredith_grey] and asks about the surgery.
[meredith_grey] seems less excited when [george_omalley] joins them.
[derek_shepherd] notices [meredith_grey]'s change in attitude.
When the elevator arrives, [george_omalley] and [meredith_grey] get on, leaving [derek_shepherd] behind.
[meredith_grey] confides in [george_omalley] that she might have done something to the heart while holding it.
[meredith_grey] admits she nodded off and thinks she might have squeezed it.
[george_omalley] reassures [meredith_grey], saying the heart is a strong muscle.
[meredith_grey] mentions her fingernail popped a glove and worries she might have punctured the heart.
[george_omalley] explains that if [meredith_grey] had punctured it, they would have noticed when they tried to reperfuse, but since the heart started again, the patient is fine.
[meredith_grey] considers telling [preston_burke].
[george_omalley] questions what there is to tell since nothing happened and the patient is okay.
[meredith_grey] and [george_omalley] both continue to reassure each other that the patient is fine.
[richard_webber], [miranda_bailey], and [george_omalley] are looking at chest X-rays for [mrs_drake].
[miranda_bailey] asks [george_omalley] for his observations.
[george_omalley] notes the lungs are hyperinflated, cloudy with bullae, and have reduced capacity, suggesting breathing difficulties.
[miranda_bailey] inquires about [george_omalley]'s next steps, and [george_omalley] mentions he would perform a bullectomy to relieve pressure.
[richard_webber], holding the chart, mentions they operated on [mrs_drake] in 1999.
Despite her previous procedure, [george_omalley] needs to explain it to [mrs_drake] again and avoid anti-smoking lectures, as she already feels guilty.
As [george_omalley] leaves, he asks [miranda_bailey] if displaying lung scans on cigarette packs would deter smoking.
Meanwhile, [derek_shepherd] and [alex_karev] are with a patient who has back pain.
[alex_karev] asks how long the pain has persisted.
The patient describes it as chronic, meaning it is constant.
[alex_karev] acknowledges understanding "chronic" and requests more details about the pain type.
The patient describes the pain as feeling like a thousand swords stabbing his spine.
The patient mentions being allergic to aspirin and most NSAIDs.
[alex_karev] suggests using morphine, but the patient insists that only Demerol or Dilaudid work for him.
[derek_shepherd] notices track marks on the patient's arm.
Outside the room, [alex_karev] thinks the patient is seeking drugs.
[alex_karev] believes the patient exaggerated the pain and calls him a junkie.
[derek_shepherd] asks [alex_karev] what he would do.
[alex_karev] suggests checking the patient's history in the database, referring him to a program, and discharging him.
[derek_shepherd] tells [alex_karev] he can do that after giving the patient something for the pain.
[alex_karev] is frustrated, saying that's what the patient wants.
[derek_shepherd] explains they must treat the pain as if it's real and that they should always be cautious in pain management.
[derek_shepherd] instructs [alex_karev] to start a central line, noting the patient's veins are damaged, and then [derek_shepherd] is paged away.
[mrs_drake] mentioned to [george_omalley] that her last surgery was meant to help, but it never felt right.
[george_omalley] suggested that quitting smoking might have been wise.
[mrs_drake] retorted that she had a 4-pack-a-day habit, which was tough, but she did quit, and it didn’t help.
[george_omalley] was surprised and said he thought [mrs_drake] was still smoking based on her scans.
[mrs_drake] confirmed she quit cold turkey 5 years ago as they prepared her for surgery.
[mrs_drake] shared that she had to leave her restaurant job because even sitting was painful, but no one believed her.
[george_omalley] assured [mrs_drake] he saw the films and it wasn’t just in her head.
[mrs_drake] asked [george_omalley] to come closer and remarked he seemed too young to be a doctor.
[george_omalley] replied that he was older than he looked.
[mrs_drake] inquired if the procedure would work this time, and [george_omalley] said it was her best option.
[mrs_drake] appreciated [george_omalley]'s honesty.
[meredith_grey] watches as [tyler_nurse] helps [mrs_patterson] settle into the hospital bed.
[meredith_grey] then greets [mr_patterson] and learns about [mrs_patterson]'s condition.
[meredith_grey] assures [mr_patterson] that [mrs_patterson]'s levels are good and explains that heart surgery is very taxing.
[meredith_grey] says they are monitoring [mrs_patterson] closely, and she should recover well.
[isobel_stevens] approaches [mr_sterman] and asks about his condition.
[mr_sterman] says he feels okay but doesn’t want another bowel obstruction.
[isobel_stevens] jokes that many people request them and asks if [mr_sterman] is managing clear fluids and if he has used the bathroom.
[mr_sterman] is unsure, so [isobel_stevens] asks if he has passed gas.
[mr_sterman] lies and says yes, but [isobel_stevens] knows he’s not telling the truth.
[mr_sterman] apologizes and reveals he attended medical school but left during his final year of clinical training.
[mr_sterman] worked too many hours and was going through a divorce.
Now, [mr_sterman] does research and has a family.
[mr_sterman] apologizes, saying he meant no offense.
[isobel_stevens] assures [mr_sterman] it's fine.
[isobel_stevens] believes it's possible to have both a successful career and a family.
[mr_sterman] doubts it, thinking doctors must prioritize their patients.
As [isobel_stevens] leaves [mr_sterman]'s room, [preston_burke] approaches [cristina_yang] at the nurse's station and gives [cristina_yang] a coffee.
[cristina_yang] looks at [preston_burke], confused, while [preston_burke] drinks his own coffee.
[preston_burke] tells [cristina_yang] it's just coffee.
[cristina_yang] awkwardly accepts it, and they part ways.
As [cristina_yang] turns the corner, [preston_burke] watches [cristina_yang] with a smile.
[meredith_grey] is washing her face in the locker room.
[richard_webber] is doing a 'spaghetti procedure' on [mrs_drake].
[miranda_bailey] explains the procedure to [george_omalley].
They notice something unusual, surprising [miranda_bailey].
[richard_webber] decides to switch to an open procedure and removes the scopes.
[richard_webber] makes an incision while [miranda_bailey] assists.
[richard_webber] pulls a towel from inside [mrs_drake].
[george_omalley] wonders about the towel's origin.
[richard_webber] guesses it’s from [mrs_drake]'s surgery 5 years ago.
[miranda_bailey] comments on the carelessness and continues assisting.
[cristina_yang] joins [richard_webber], [miranda_bailey], and [george_omalley] outside the OR.
[cristina_yang] is surprised about the towel.
[george_omalley] explains [mrs_drake] had complained about chest pressure, but no one took her seriously.
[richard_webber] said it was bad for [mrs_drake] and the hospital as he left.
[miranda_bailey] asked [cristina_yang] to find all information about the initial operation, including who was present and who closed.
[miranda_bailey] told [george_omalley] to stay with [mrs_drake], who liked him.
[george_omalley] asked how long he needed to wait since his shift ended at 6pm.
[miranda_bailey] knew about the party and asked if she was invited.
[george_omalley] confirmed [miranda_bailey] was.
After [miranda_bailey] left, [cristina_yang] looked at [george_omalley] annoyed, but [george_omalley] was unsure what else to say.
[isobel_stevens] was on the phone ordering beer for the party when [alex_karev] asked for local microbrews and bar nuts.
[isobel_stevens] pretended to order office supplies but made the request and changed delivery from 5 to 7.
[mr_sterman] passed [isobel_stevens] and joked about being invited if he pooped.
[derek_shepherd] heard his pain patient complaining and struggling with a nurse as [derek_shepherd] walked by.
Mr.
[jerry_frost] asks [derek_shepherd] where [derek_shepherd] has been.
[derek_shepherd] assures [jerry_frost] they will help and goes to find [alex_karev].
[derek_shepherd] criticizes [alex_karev] for not starting a central line as instructed.
[alex_karev] explains the patient has been in seven hospitals in four months and is an addict.
[derek_shepherd] points out the patient has a 3-lumbar fusion, but [alex_karev] only sees an addict.
[derek_shepherd] acknowledges the addiction but insists the pain is real.
[derek_shepherd] tells [alex_karev] to drop the attitude and start the central line.
[george_omalley] is with [mrs_drake], who mentions a handsome, older surgeon told her about a towel left inside her.
[george_omalley] identifies the surgeon as [richard_webber], their chief.
[mrs_drake] realizes the towel was left after her last surgery and questions how that could happen.
[george_omalley] agrees with [mrs_drake]'s concern.
[cristina_yang] enters an office and searches through files for information on Mrs. Drake’s initial surgery.
[cristina_yang] finds a post-op report naming [dr_john_davies] as the surgeon and [preston_burke] as the surgical fellow.
[cristina_yang] takes this information to [miranda_bailey] and asks what to do next.
[miranda_bailey] advises [cristina_yang] to keep it private while they figure it out.
[meredith_grey] is at the nurse’s station when [derek_shepherd] approaches.
[derek_shepherd] senses something is wrong and asks [meredith_grey] if she’s okay.
[meredith_grey] says she’s just tired from a long procedure.
[derek_shepherd] invites [meredith_grey] to dinner, but [meredith_grey] declines.
[derek_shepherd] mentions forgetting about the party, surprising [meredith_grey] since she hadn’t told [derek_shepherd] about it.
[derek_shepherd] sarcastically thanks [meredith_grey] for not inviting him and suggests she reconsider dinner as he leaves.
[meredith_grey] is then paged.
[meredith_grey] goes to Mrs. Patterson’s bed, where [tyler_nurse] informs [meredith_grey] there was swelling over the sternum, followed by heavy bleeding.
[tyler_nurse] had already contacted [preston_burke].
[mr_patterson] wanted to know if [mrs_patterson] was dying.
[meredith_grey] asked someone to remove [mr_patterson] and apply pressure to the wound.
When [preston_burke] arrived, he instructed [tyler_nurse] to arrange an OR and asked [meredith_grey] for an update.
[meredith_grey] informed [preston_burke] that [mrs_patterson] had received medication without any allergic reactions and updated him on her lab results.
[preston_burke] was unsure about the issue and told the team to move.
[meredith_grey] hesitated but admitted she had torn a glove in the OR.
[mr_patterson] heard everything and watched as they took [mrs_patterson] to surgery.
In the OR, [preston_burke] criticized [meredith_grey] for not speaking up earlier.
[meredith_grey] had chances to tell [preston_burke] before he closed, but instead, she confessed in front of [mr_patterson].
[preston_burke] says [meredith_grey] isn't sure if it was her fault and keeps apologizing.
[preston_burke] finds the problem and calls [meredith_grey] to the table.
There is a rupture in the wall, larger than a fingernail.
[preston_burke] explains that [mrs_patterson]'s ventricular walls are weak.
[richard_webber] enters from the scrub room and mentions he spoke with [mr_patterson].
[richard_webber] requests copies of [mrs_patterson]'s chart in his office by 5pm.
[richard_webber] informs [preston_burke] and [meredith_grey] that they will meet with legal tomorrow and must explain the situation.
As [richard_webber] leaves, he complains about mistakes like poking holes in hearts and leaving towels behind.
[preston_burke] tells [meredith_grey] he will talk to [mr_patterson] and advises her to review the history and apologize a lot.
[meredith_grey]'s job is at risk.
[meredith_grey] is reviewing the chart with [cristina_yang] and [george_omalley].
[meredith_grey] mentions she has to meet the chief tomorrow morning and might be expelled from the program.
[george_omalley] doubts [meredith_grey] will be expelled, while [cristina_yang] thinks [mr_patterson] might sue.
[cristina_yang] questions why [meredith_grey] informed [preston_burke].
[george_omalley] says he advised [meredith_grey] not to tell [preston_burke].
[meredith_grey]'s phone rings, and she sarcastically thanks [cristina_yang] and [george_omalley] for their support as she answers it.
[isobel_stevens] arrives with coffee, a banana, and chips, mentioning that beer will arrive at 7 PM and some floor nurses are bringing wine.
[cristina_yang] is annoyed about the nurses being invited.
[george_omalley] asks if [isobel_stevens] has [meredith_grey]'s approval.
[isobel_stevens] believes a few more people won't matter, saying a party is a party.
[cristina_yang] agrees, noting that a bigger party means less time for bad sex with her hockey player.
[isobel_stevens] tells [cristina_yang] to stop, insisting she and [hank] have great sex often and might even during the party.
[cristina_yang] laughs, and [george_omalley] reminds [isobel_stevens] to check with [meredith_grey].
[isobel_stevens] mentions that [hank] needs to see doctors can have fun and aren't just workaholics.
[cristina_yang] insists doctors are workaholics, which annoys [isobel_stevens].
[george_omalley] plays with an inflated glove.
[meredith_grey] is on the phone confirming a notary will arrive at 6:30, along with the home's doctor to verify her mother's mental competency.
[meredith_grey] asks if she needs anything besides her license and checkbook, confirms the time again, and ends the call.
[derek_shepherd] approaches [meredith_grey], having overheard.
[meredith_grey] assumes [derek_shepherd] is talking about her call and tries to cover, but [derek_shepherd] is referring to the heart issue and asks if she wants to discuss it.
[meredith_grey] says they're adults but questions when that happened and how to stop it as she leaves.
[cristina_yang] puts a patient chart back on the rack while [preston_burke] is working at the nurse’s station.
[cristina_yang] and [preston_burke] greet each other awkwardly.
[cristina_yang] mentions the heart graft complication.
[preston_burke] says he could handle it.
[cristina_yang] walks away but feels uncertain.
[mr_patterson] is on the phone outside the hospital.
[mr_patterson] ends the call when [meredith_grey] approaches.
[mr_patterson] explains it was his lawyer, who advised against talking to [meredith_grey].
[meredith_grey] understands [mr_patterson]'s frustration and anger.
[meredith_grey] asks for information about [mr_patterson]'s wife.
[meredith_grey] explains the walls of [mrs_patterson]'s heart are abnormally thin.
This angers [mr_patterson] more.
[mr_patterson] insists not to blame his wife.
[mr_patterson] says he heard directly from [mrs_patterson] what happened.
[mr_patterson] claims she was in the best shape of her life.
[mr_patterson] suggests [meredith_grey] ask [mrs_patterson]'s cardiologist.
[mr_patterson] mentions [mrs_patterson] had just lost 100 pounds and warns [meredith_grey] not to blame his wife.
[meredith_grey] tries again to talk, but [mr_patterson] refuses and leaves.
[alex_karev] and [derek_shepherd] are in [jerry_frost]'s room.
[alex_karev] and [derek_shepherd] tell [jerry_frost] they've realized he's only there to get drugs because of his addiction.
[alex_karev] and [derek_shepherd] advise [jerry_frost] to go home and seek help.
Meanwhile, [isobel_stevens] is in [mr_sterman]'s room.
[derek_shepherd] asks [isobel_stevens] to discharge the drug-addicted patient.
In the hallway, [isobel_stevens] and [george_omalley] plan to get beers for the party.
[isobel_stevens] asks [george_omalley] to buy them.
[alex_karev] overhears and teasingly suggests [isobel_stevens] ask her boyfriend.
[isobel_stevens] irritably replies that she didn't invite [alex_karev] because [alex_karev] is unpleasant.
[alex_karev] says [alex_karev] wouldn't have come anyway.
[george_omalley] is concerned that [meredith_grey] doesn't know how many people will be at [meredith_grey]'s house.
[isobel_stevens] wants to tell [meredith_grey], but [cristina_yang] warns that [meredith_grey] has already left.
[george_omalley] asks [isobel_stevens] to inform [meredith_grey] that [george_omalley] is not involved with the party.
[meredith_grey] goes to the notary, but [meredith_grey]'s mother, who is having an Alzheimer's crisis, won't sign the house documents.
[meredith_grey] pleads with her mother to focus and sign.
The notary's secretary informs [meredith_grey] that they can't complete the deal that day and suggests [meredith_grey] return when her mother is clear-headed.
Frustrated, [meredith_grey] leaves angrily.
[cristina_yang] notices [miranda_bailey] and [preston_burke] talking.
[cristina_yang] realizes [miranda_bailey] is giving [preston_burke] files about a surgery where [preston_burke] left a sponge inside [mrs_drake].
[preston_burke] looks at the files, concerned.
[meredith_grey] returns home to find a party happening at [meredith_grey]'s place.
During the party, [cristina_yang] asks [miranda_bailey] for updates on [mrs_drake]'s case.
[miranda_bailey] advises [cristina_yang] to stay out of it.
At the hospital, [isobel_stevens], [alex_karev], and a nurse are escorting [jerry_frost], who suddenly becomes violent.
Some nurses try to hold [jerry_frost], but [jerry_frost] escapes, falls, hits his head, and loses consciousness.
[derek_shepherd] looks at [jerry_frost]'s CT scan.
[derek_shepherd] asks [isobel_stevens] and [alex_karev] what they notice.
[isobel_stevens] and [alex_karev] see a subdural hemorrhage.
[derek_shepherd] says they must operate right away.
[derek_shepherd] asks [isobel_stevens] if she is leaving or staying for the surgery.
[isobel_stevens] says she wants to stay.
At the party, [meredith_grey] asks [george_omalley] about [isobel_stevens]'s whereabouts.
[meredith_grey] tells [george_omalley] the party was meant to be a small gathering to meet her boyfriend.
[meredith_grey] says she is overwhelmed, and [george_omalley] offers to send everyone home.
Meanwhile, [cristina_yang], who is drunk, greets [meredith_grey].
[meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] start drinking and dancing.
[meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] invite [george_omalley] to join them.
[derek_shepherd], [isobel_stevens], and [alex_karev] are performing surgery on [jerry_frost].
[alex_karev] mentions [alex_karev]'s father was addicted to heroin.
At the party, [cristina_yang] and [meredith_grey] continue playing while drunk.
[hank] arrives and asks about [isobel_stevens].
[cristina_yang] tells [hank] [isobel_stevens] isn't there and won't return soon.
[hank] is surprised by the large party and keeps asking when [isobel_stevens] will arrive.
After the surgery, [derek_shepherd] asks [isobel_stevens] and [alex_karev] to finish caring for [jerry_frost].
[alex_karev] offers to handle it and tells [isobel_stevens] she can go to her boyfriend.
[isobel_stevens] thanks [alex_karev] but looks upset.
[hank] waits outside the hospital for [isobel_stevens].
[hank] and [isobel_stevens] greet with a kiss.
[isobel_stevens] starts talking about the surgery.
[hank] mentions he didn't want a big party and doesn't want to meet [isobel_stevens]'s coworkers.
[isobel_stevens] reminds [hank] he was okay meeting her colleagues when she was a model.
[hank] points out [isobel_stevens] used to attend those parties.
[isobel_stevens] insists her life has changed and her patients are now her priority.
[hank] and [isobel_stevens] argue because [hank] traveled far for her, but she focused on work.
[isobel_stevens] asks [hank] to come to the party.
[hank] refuses and leaves.
[meredith_grey] is outside the house, drunk.
[meredith_grey] sees [derek_shepherd] leaning against a car, waiting for her.
[meredith_grey] and [derek_shepherd] start flirting and talk about tequila.
[meredith_grey] and [derek_shepherd] kiss and have sex in the car.
[miranda_bailey] sees [meredith_grey] and [derek_shepherd] from outside.
The next morning, the house is messy.
[george_omalley] brings [meredith_grey] a cup.
[meredith_grey] tells [george_omalley] she has to meet the chief in an hour.
[isobel_stevens] enters and asks about the mess.
[meredith_grey], feeling down, jokes that [isobel_stevens] shouldn't talk to her, but says it’s no big deal since she had nothing else to do.
[george_omalley] sarcastically reminds [meredith_grey] she was supposed to prepare for a meeting that could ruin her.
They discuss [mrs_patterson].
[meredith_grey] says the heart shouldn't have torn because [mrs_patterson] lost 50 pounds and was in great shape.
[isobel_stevens] thinks about whether losing 50 pounds in a year affected [mrs_patterson]'s muscle mass.
[meredith_grey] is at a meeting.
Meanwhile, [george_omalley], [isobel_stevens], and [cristina_yang] are betting on the meeting's outcome.
[meredith_grey] talks to [richard_webber] and takes responsibility for the previous day's events.
[meredith_grey] mentions that the patient's condition, who still weighs 100 pounds, is crucial.
The patient's muscle mass, including heart muscle, has reduced significantly due to weight loss.
[richard_webber] believes this explains the heart tearing after a minor impact.
The hospital lawyer points out that [meredith_grey] didn't report the minor impact quickly, risking hospital liability.
[preston_burke] defends [meredith_grey] and shares his experience with [mrs_drake].
[preston_burke] recalls not reporting a sponge left inside a patient five years ago due to fear of career consequences.
[preston_burke] believes even great doctors make mistakes and should speak up without fear.
[meredith_grey] informs her colleagues that she wasn't fired and will be monitored for a month.
[miranda_bailey] tells [cristina_yang] that [preston_burke] had planned to reveal [mrs_drake]'s case secret and was waiting for the right time because "information is power."
[ellis_grey] finally signs documents in front of [meredith_grey].
[alex_karev] sets up a meeting for [jerry_frost], who is recovering in bed after surgery, with a psychologist to help with addiction recovery.
[preston_burke] apologizes to [mrs_drake].
[miranda_bailey] looks at [derek_shepherd] disapprovingly.
[mr_sterman] informs [isobel_stevens] that he finally had a bowel movement, which makes [isobel_stevens] happy.
[alex_karev] joins [isobel_stevens] and jokes around.
[cristina_yang] and [preston_burke] have sex in the locker room.
[meredith_grey], [george_omalley], [isobel_stevens], and [cristina_yang] clean the house after the party.
