[meredith_grey] is sleeping in the shower while holding a toothbrush.
[meredith_grey] wakes up when her arm slips from her knee and continues her shower.
Later, [meredith_grey] goes to the nursing home where [ellis_grey] lives.
[meredith_grey] talks about having [ellis_grey] sign over her estate while [ellis_grey] is still clear-minded.
[meredith_grey] watches [ellis_grey] through the glass and mentions that [meredith_grey] hasn’t slept in 48 hours.
[meredith_grey] explains that [meredith_grey] is missing rounds because [meredith_grey] is scheduled for heart surgery that morning.
[meredith_grey] asks if there is anyone else who can handle the situation.
The nursing home representative tells [meredith_grey] that they are discussing [meredith_grey]'s mother’s estate, finances, and medical care.
The representative asks if [meredith_grey] really wants to leave [meredith_grey]'s mother’s care to someone else.
In the operating room, [preston_burke] is placing a stitch.
[meredith_grey] starts to nod off while holding the heart.
[preston_burke] sees [meredith_grey] jerk awake and asks about it.
[meredith_grey] apologizes and says the heart slipped.
[meredith_grey] adds that [preston_burke] is finished, so [meredith_grey] can release Mrs. Patterson’s heart now.
As they prepare to take the patient off bypass, [george_omalley] and [cristina_yang] watch from the gallery.
[george_omalley] feels jealous that [meredith_grey] got to hold a heart.
[cristina_yang] believes a monkey could hold a heart.
[george_omalley] thinks [cristina_yang] feels this way because [cristina_yang] is upset that [preston_burke] didn’t ask [cristina_yang] to help.
[izzie_stevens] enters looking for [george_omalley].
[izzie_stevens] tells [george_omalley] that [izzie_stevens] needs more ice and chips.
[george_omalley] is surprised and asks how many people [izzie_stevens] invited.
[cristina_yang] reminds [george_omalley] and [izzie_stevens] that the invite list was only for surgery, trauma, and plastics.
[izzie_stevens] mentions that [izzie_stevens] invited some people from pediatrics, which [cristina_yang] refers to as preschoolers.
[cristina_yang] thinks therapists will be next.
When [izzie_stevens] turns away, [izzie_stevens] realizes [izzie_stevens] already invited them and says the party is already dead.
[george_omalley] reminds [izzie_stevens] that [meredith_grey] thinks this is a small cocktail gathering to meet boyfriends.
[george_omalley] asks [izzie_stevens] if [izzie_stevens] cleared it with [meredith_grey] first.
[izzie_stevens] admits [izzie_stevens] didn’t but promises to do so.
[cristina_yang] questions why [izzie_stevens] is using the weekend with [izzie_stevens]'s boyfriend for a party.
[cristina_yang] assumes it’s because [izzie_stevens]'s boyfriend is not good in bed.
[izzie_stevens] denies this and says [izzie_stevens] just wants [izzie_stevens]'s boyfriend to meet [izzie_stevens]'s friends.
[cristina_yang] is unsure but is called away.
[alex_karev] enters and asks about a party at [meredith_grey]'s house.
[alex_karev] takes [cristina_yang]'s seat.
[cristina_yang], [george_omalley], and [izzie_stevens] all say there is no party while [alex_karev] watches the surgery below.
In the operating room, an alarm sounds, but the team is unsure of the issue.
The anesthesiologist informs Preston [preston_burke] that the patient's temperature is rising as they massage the heart. Preston [preston_burke] comments that the patient should be able to do that on her own by now. Suddenly, the patient flatlines. Preston [preston_burke] and the team continue chest compressions while Preston [preston_burke] requests paddles and shocks the patient twice before restoring a heartbeat. Preston [preston_burke] praises the team and leaves to scrub out. As [meredith_grey] turns away from the table, [meredith_grey] sees that her fingernail has punctured her glove and worries she may have caused a problem. [dr_derek_shepherd] approaches [meredith_grey] while eating and asks how the surgery went. [meredith_grey] feels less excited when [george_omalley] arrives. [dr_derek_shepherd] sees [meredith_grey]'s change in mood. When the elevator comes, [george_omalley] and [meredith_grey] get in, leaving [dr_derek_shepherd] behind. [meredith_grey] tells [george_omalley] she might have accidentally harmed the heart while holding it. [meredith_grey] fell asleep briefly and thinks she may have squeezed it too hard. [george_omalley] brushes off [meredith_grey]'s concern, saying the heart is strong. [meredith_grey] mentions that her fingernail broke a glove. [meredith_grey] worries that she might have punctured the patient’s heart. [george_omalley] reassures [meredith_grey] that if she had, they would have noticed when they tried to restore blood flow. Since they got the patient’s heart started again, everything is fine. [meredith_grey] questions whether she should inform Preston [preston_burke].
[george_omalley] insists there’s nothing to report because nothing went wrong and the patient is okay.
[george_omalley] and [meredith_grey] both reassure each other that the patient is fine.
[richard_webber], [miranda_bailey], and [george_omalley] are looking at chest films for [mrs_drake].
[miranda_bailey] asks [george_omalley] what he notices.
[george_omalley] sees hyperinflated lungs that are cloudy and have bullae.
[george_omalley] notes that [mrs_drake] likely has trouble breathing.
[miranda_bailey] then asks what [george_omalley] would do next.
[george_omalley] replies that he would perform a bullectomy to relieve the pressure.
[richard_webber] checks the chart and mentions that they operated on [mrs_drake] in 1999.
Even though [mrs_drake] has had this procedure before, [george_omalley] still needs to explain it to her and avoid anti-smoking talks, as [mrs_drake] already feels bad.
As [george_omalley] leaves, he asks [miranda_bailey] if putting the lung scan on cigarette packs would make people stop smoking.
Meanwhile, [dr_derek_shepherd] and [alex_karev] are with a patient who has back pain.
[alex_karev] asks the patient how long he has been in pain.
The patient explains that it is chronic, meaning it hurts all the time.
[alex_karev] acknowledges that he understands what chronic means and asks the patient to describe the type of pain he feels.
The patient describes his pain as if a thousand samurai are stabbing him in the spine.
The patient mentions he is allergic to aspirin and most NSAIDs.
[alex_karev] suggests using morphine, but the patient insists that only Demerol or dilaudid helps.
Derek notices track marks on the patient's arm.
Derek and [alex_karev] leave the room, and [alex_karev] thinks the patient is just seeking drugs.
[alex_karev] believes the patient has exaggerated his pain and calls the patient a junkie.
Derek asks [alex_karev] what [alex_karev] would do in this situation.
[alex_karev] wants to check the patient's history in the database, refer the patient to a program, and then discharge the patient.
Derek agrees to check the history but insists on giving the patient something first.
[alex_karev] feels annoyed, thinking this is what the patient wants.
Derek argues that they must treat the pain as if it is real.
Derek states that the first rule of pain management is to be cautious.
Derek instructs [alex_karev] to start a central line, noting that the patient’s veins are in poor condition, and then Derek is paged away.
[mrs_drake] tells [george_omalley] that [mrs_drake]'s last surgery was meant to help [mrs_drake], but it never felt right.
[george_omalley] suggests that quitting smoking might have been a good idea.
[mrs_drake] responds that [mrs_drake] used to smoke four packs a day, which was very difficult, but [mrs_drake] quit and it didn’t help at all.
This surprises [george_omalley], who thought [mrs_drake] was still smoking based on [mrs_drake]'s scans.
[mrs_drake] confirms that [mrs_drake] quit cold-turkey five years ago as [george_omalley] and the medical team prepare [mrs_drake] for surgery.
[mrs_drake] explains that [mrs_drake] had to leave [mrs_drake]'s job at the restaurant because even sitting hurt, but no one believed [mrs_drake].
[george_omalley] reassures [mrs_drake] that [george_omalley] saw the films, and it’s not just in [mrs_drake]'s head.
[mrs_drake] asks [george_omalley] to come closer and comments that [george_omalley] looks too young to be a doctor.
[george_omalley] insists [george_omalley] is older than [george_omalley] appears.
[mrs_drake] inquires if [george_omalley] thinks the procedure will work this time, and [george_omalley] tells [mrs_drake] it’s [mrs_drake]'s best option.
[mrs_drake] appreciates [george_omalley]'s honesty.
[meredith_grey] watches from a distance as Nurse [tyler] helps [mrs_patterson] settle into [mrs_patterson]'s hospital bed.
[meredith_grey] then approaches [mr_patterson] to greet him and get an update on [mrs_patterson]'s condition.
[meredith_grey] reassures [mr_patterson] that [mrs_patterson]'s levels are stable.
[meredith_grey] explains that heart surgery is very taxing on patients and that the medical team is monitoring [mrs_patterson] closely.
[meredith_grey] believes [mrs_patterson] will be okay.
[izzie_stevens] pulls the curtain aside as [izzie_stevens] walks over to [mr_sterman].
[izzie_stevens] asks [mr_sterman] how [mr_sterman] is feeling today.
[mr_sterman] replies that [mr_sterman] feels mostly fine but hopes to avoid another bowel obstruction.
[izzie_stevens] jokes about how many people request bowel obstructions and checks if [mr_sterman] is managing to keep down clear fluids.
[izzie_stevens] also asks [mr_sterman] if [mr_sterman] has used the bathroom yet.
[mr_sterman] is uncertain, but [izzie_stevens] suggests [mr_sterman] would likely know if [mr_sterman] had.
[izzie_stevens] then inquires if [mr_sterman] has passed gas.
[mr_sterman] says yes, but [izzie_stevens] suspects [mr_sterman] is not telling the truth.
[mr_sterman] admits [mr_sterman] lied and shares that [mr_sterman] attended medical school but dropped out during [mr_sterman]'s last year of clinical training.
[mr_sterman] had been working too many hours and was going through a divorce.
Now, [mr_sterman] does research and has a life and family.
[mr_sterman] apologizes for any offense, but [izzie_stevens] reassures [mr_sterman] it’s fine.
[izzie_stevens] believes it is possible for someone to have both a successful career and a family.
[mr_sterman] is uncertain, thinking a doctor's main duty is to the patients.
As [izzie_stevens] leaves Mr. Sterman’s room, [preston_burke] approaches [cristina_yang] at the nurse’s station.
[preston_burke] hands [cristina_yang] a coffee while sipping his own.
[cristina_yang] looks up at [preston_burke], confused.
[preston_burke] tells [cristina_yang] it’s just coffee.
[cristina_yang] awkwardly takes the coffee, and [preston_burke] and [cristina_yang] part ways.
After [cristina_yang] turns the corner, [preston_burke] looks back at [cristina_yang] with a smile.
[meredith_grey] is washing her face in the locker room.
[richard_webber] is doing a procedure on [mrs_drake] while [miranda_bailey] explains it to [george_omalley].
[miranda_bailey] and [george_omalley] see something strange in the field, which surprises [miranda_bailey].
[richard_webber] decides to switch to an open procedure and removes the scopes.
[richard_webber] makes an incision while [miranda_bailey] helps him.
[richard_webber] then pulls a towel out from inside [mrs_drake].
[george_omalley] asks [richard_webber] where the towel came from, and [richard_webber] guesses it might be from [mrs_drake]'s surgery five years ago.
[miranda_bailey] warns that something careless is happening and continues to assist.
[cristina_yang] joins [richard_webber], [miranda_bailey], and [george_omalley] outside the operating room.
[cristina_yang] is surprised that [richard_webber], [miranda_bailey], and [george_omalley] found a towel in a patient.
[george_omalley] explains that [mrs_drake] had complained of chest pressure, but no one took [mrs_drake] seriously.
[richard_webber] leaves, stating that the situation is bad for [mrs_drake] and the hospital.
[miranda_bailey] asks [cristina_yang] to look through the files for details about the initial operation.
[miranda_bailey] needs [cristina_yang] to find out who was in the room and who closed it.
[miranda_bailey] tells [george_omalley] to stay with [mrs_drake], who seems to like [george_omalley].
[george_omalley] asks how long he has to wait since [george_omalley]'s shift ends at 6pm.
[miranda_bailey] knows about the party and asks [george_omalley] if [miranda_bailey] is invited.
[george_omalley] confirms that [miranda_bailey] is invited.
After [miranda_bailey] leaves, [cristina_yang] looks at [george_omalley] with irritation.
[george_omalley] is confused about what [george_omalley] should have said.
[izzie_stevens] is on the phone ordering beer for the party when [alex_karev] approaches [izzie_stevens].
[alex_karev] asks for local microbrews and bar snacks.
[izzie_stevens] tells [alex_karev] she is ordering office supplies but agrees to add [alex_karev]'s request and changes the delivery time from 5 to 7.
[mr_sterman] walks by and jokingly asks if [mr_sterman] will be invited to the party if [mr_sterman] poops.
Derek hears a pain patient complaining and struggling with a nurse as Derek walks by.
Frost asks Derek where Derek has been.
Derek assures Frost that Derek will help and goes to find [alex_karev].
Derek scolds [alex_karev] for not starting a central line without questioning Derek.
[alex_karev] responds that the patient has been in seven hospitals in four months and is an addict.
Derek acknowledges the patient’s addiction but insists that the patient’s pain is real.
Derek tells [alex_karev] to stop being disrespectful and to start the central line.
[george_omalley] is with [mrs_drake].
[mrs_drake] mentions that a handsome, older male surgeon told [mrs_drake] that [mrs_drake] had a towel inside her.
[george_omalley] informs [mrs_drake] that the surgeon is [richard_webber], their chief.
[mrs_drake] realizes that the towel was left inside after Mrs. Drake’s last surgery and questions how that could happen.
[george_omalley] agrees that it doesn’t seem right.
[cristina_yang] enters an office and begins searching through files for information about Mrs. Drake’s initial surgery.
[cristina_yang] finds a post-operative report.
The report lists Dr. John Davies as the surgeon and [dr_preston_burke] as the surgical fellow.
[cristina_yang] takes this information to [miranda_bailey] and asks what will happen next.
[miranda_bailey] tells [cristina_yang] to keep it private while they sort it out.
[meredith_grey] is at the nurse’s station when Derek approaches [meredith_grey].
Derek notices that [meredith_grey] seems off and asks if [meredith_grey] is okay.
[meredith_grey] replies that [meredith_grey] is just tired from a long procedure.
Derek invites [meredith_grey] to dinner that night, but [meredith_grey] declines.
Derek suggests that [meredith_grey] forget about the party, which surprises [meredith_grey] since [meredith_grey] hadn’t mentioned it.
Derek sarcastically thanks [meredith_grey] for not inviting him, saying it felt good.
Derek tells [meredith_grey] to think about dinner as Derek leaves, and [meredith_grey] receives a page.
[meredith_grey] goes to Mrs. Patterson’s bed.
Nurse [tyler] informs [meredith_grey] that there was swelling over the sternum, followed by blood gushing.
Preston [preston_burke] has been paged by someone.
[mr_patterson] is anxious to know if [mrs_patterson] is dying.
[meredith_grey] asks someone to take [mr_patterson] away and to apply pressure to the wound.
When Preston [preston_burke] arrives, Preston instructs [tyler] to call for an operating room and asks [meredith_grey] for an update.
[meredith_grey] informs Preston that [mrs_patterson] has received medication without any allergic reactions and shares [meredith_grey]'s lab results.
Preston is confused about what went wrong and tells the team to act quickly.
[meredith_grey] hesitates but admits that [meredith_grey] accidentally popped a glove in the operating room.
[mr_patterson] overhears this and watches as the team takes [mrs_patterson] to surgery.
In the operating room, Preston scolds [meredith_grey] for not speaking up earlier.
Preston points out that [meredith_grey] had many chances to inform Preston before Preston closed and that [meredith_grey] confessed in front of [mr_patterson].
Preston mentions that [meredith_grey] is unsure if [meredith_grey] is to blame, and [meredith_grey] keeps apologizing.
Preston then identifies the issue and signals for [meredith_grey] to join him at the table.
There is a significant rupture in the wall, much larger than a fingernail.
Preston informs [meredith_grey] that [mrs_patterson] has weak ventricular walls just as [richard_webber] enters from the scrub room.
[richard_webber] says he spoke with [mr_patterson] and needs copies of [mrs_patterson]'s chart in his office by 5 PM.
[richard_webber] adds that [preston_burke] and [meredith_grey] will meet with legal tomorrow and must explain what happened.
As [richard_webber] leaves, [richard_webber] complains about people damaging hearts and leaving towels behind.
[preston_burke] tells [meredith_grey] he will return to speak with [mr_patterson] and advises [meredith_grey] to review the history and apologize sincerely.
[preston_burke] warns [meredith_grey] that her job is at stake.
[meredith_grey] is now going over the chart with [cristina_yang] and [george_omalley].
[meredith_grey] informs [cristina_yang] and [george_omalley] that she must meet the chief tomorrow morning.
[meredith_grey] mentions that she might be removed from the program.
[george_omalley] doubts that [meredith_grey] will be removed.
[cristina_yang] believes that [mr_patterson] will file a lawsuit.
[cristina_yang] questions why [meredith_grey] told [preston_burke].
[george_omalley] mentions he advised [meredith_grey] not to share that information.
[meredith_grey]'s phone rings, and [meredith_grey] says she needs to answer it.
[meredith_grey] sarcastically thanks [cristina_yang] and [george_omalley] for their support.
[izzie_stevens] arrives with coffee, a banana, and chips.
[cristina_yang] mentions that beer will arrive at 7 PM and some floor nurses are bringing wine.
[cristina_yang] is upset that [izzie_stevens] invited nurses.
[george_omalley] asks if [izzie_stevens] checked with [meredith_grey].
[izzie_stevens] argues that a few more guests won't matter; a party is a party.
[cristina_yang] agrees but adds that a bigger party means less time for [cristina_yang]'s bad sex with [cristina_yang]'s hockey player.
[izzie_stevens] tells [cristina_yang] to stop, claiming that [izzie_stevens] and [hank] have great sex often.
[izzie_stevens] suggests that [izzie_stevens] and [hank] might even have sex after or during the party.
[cristina_yang] laughs.
[george_omalley] reminds [cristina_yang] to check with [meredith_grey].
[izzie_stevens] says [hank] needs to understand that doctors can have fun and are not just workaholics.
[cristina_yang] disagrees, saying that is exactly what doctors are, which annoys [izzie_stevens].
Meanwhile, [george_omalley] plays with an inflated glove.
[meredith_grey] is on the phone.
[meredith_grey] confirms that the notary will arrive at 6:30.
The doctor will also be there to verify [meredith_grey]'s mother’s mental competency.
[meredith_grey] asks if [meredith_grey] needs to bring anything besides [meredith_grey]'s license and checkbook.
After confirming the time again, [meredith_grey] ends the call as Derek arrives.
Derek mentions that Derek heard [meredith_grey]'s conversation.
[meredith_grey] thinks Derek is referring to her phone call and tries to change the subject.
However, Derek is actually talking about the heart issue and asks if [meredith_grey] wants to discuss it.
[meredith_grey] responds that [meredith_grey] and Derek are adults but wonders when that happened and how to stop it as [meredith_grey] leaves.
[cristina_yang] returns a patient chart to the rack.
[preston_burke] is at the nurse’s station, busy with charting.
[cristina_yang] and [preston_burke] greet each other awkwardly.
[cristina_yang] brings up the heart graft issue.
[preston_burke] responds that it was manageable for him.
[cristina_yang] walks away, feeling uncertain.
[mr_patterson] is outside the hospital on the phone.
[mr_patterson] quickly hangs up when [meredith_grey] approaches.
[mr_patterson] explains that it was his lawyer, who advised him not to speak with [meredith_grey].
[meredith_grey] sees that [mr_patterson] is frustrated and angry.
[meredith_grey] asks [mr_patterson] for details about his wife.
[meredith_grey] informs [mr_patterson] that his wife's heart walls are unusually thin, which makes [mr_patterson] even angrier.
[mr_patterson] tells [meredith_grey] not to blame his wife for the situation.
[mr_patterson] insists that he heard directly from his wife what happened.
[mr_patterson] claims his wife was in excellent health and suggests that [meredith_grey] consult his wife's cardiologist.
[mr_patterson] mentions that [mrs_patterson] had recently lost 100 pounds and warns [meredith_grey] not to place any blame on [mrs_patterson].
[meredith_grey] tries to talk again, but [mr_patterson] says he is finished and walks away.
[alex_karev] and Derek are in [jerry_frost]'s room.
[alex_karev] and Derek tell [jerry_frost] that they know [jerry_frost] is there to ask for drugs because of [jerry_frost]'s addiction.
[alex_karev] and Derek advise [jerry_frost] to go home and seek help.
[izzie_stevens] is in [mr_sterman]'s room when Derek asks [izzie_stevens] to discharge the drug-addicted patient.
In the hallway, [izzie_stevens] and [george_omalley] plan to get beers for the party.
[izzie_stevens] asks [george_omalley] to get the beers.
[alex_karev] overhears [izzie_stevens] and [george_omalley] and suggests [izzie_stevens] should ask her boyfriend instead.
[izzie_stevens] replies that she didn't invite [alex_karev] because [alex_karev] is unpleasant.
[alex_karev] claims he wouldn't have come anyway.
[george_omalley] is concerned that [meredith_grey] doesn't realize how many people will be at [meredith_grey]'s house.
[izzie_stevens] wants to inform [meredith_grey], but [cristina_yang] warns [izzie_stevens] that [meredith_grey] has already left.
[george_omalley] asks [izzie_stevens] to tell [meredith_grey] that [george_omalley] is not involved in the party.
[meredith_grey] goes to the notary.
[ellis_grey], who has Alzheimer's, refuses to sign the house documents.
[meredith_grey] pleads with [ellis_grey] to focus and sign.
The notary's secretary informs [meredith_grey] that they cannot complete the deal that day.
[izzie_stevens] suggests [meredith_grey] return the next day when [ellis_grey] is clearer.
Frustrated, [meredith_grey] leaves angrily.
[cristina_yang] sees [miranda_bailey] and [preston_burke] talking.
[cristina_yang] realizes [miranda_bailey] is giving [preston_burke] the files about the surgery where a sponge was left inside [mrs_drake].
[preston_burke] looks through the files, feeling worried.
When [meredith_grey] gets home, [meredith_grey] finds a party happening at [meredith_grey]'s place.
During the party, [cristina_yang] asks [miranda_bailey] for updates on [mrs_drake]'s sponge case.
[miranda_bailey] advises [cristina_yang] not to get involved.
At the hospital, [izzie_stevens] and [alex_karev], along with a nurse, are escorting [jerry_frost].
[jerry_frost] reacts violently.
Some nurses try to hold a man down, but the man gets up and runs away.
The man falls, hits his head, and loses consciousness.
Derek looks at the CT scan results of [jerry_frost]'s head.
Derek asks [izzie_stevens] and [alex_karev] what they see in the scans.
[izzie_stevens] and [alex_karev] identify a subdural hemorrhage.
Derek states that they need to perform surgery right away.
Derek asks [izzie_stevens] if [izzie_stevens] was meant to leave or if [izzie_stevens] wants to stay for the surgery.
[izzie_stevens] replies that [izzie_stevens] wants to stay.
At the party, [meredith_grey] sees [george_omalley] and asks about [izzie_stevens]. [meredith_grey] scolds [george_omalley] because the party was meant to be a small gathering for friends to meet [meredith_grey]'s boyfriend. [meredith_grey] expresses that [meredith_grey] can't handle the situation. [george_omalley] offers to ask everyone to leave. Meanwhile, a drunk [cristina_yang] approaches [meredith_grey]. [meredith_grey] drinks and dances with [cristina_yang]. [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] invite [george_omalley] to join them. Derek, [izzie_stevens], and [alex_karev] are in surgery with a patient named [jerry_frost]. [alex_karev] shares that [alex_karev]'s father struggled with heroin addiction. At the party, [cristina_yang] and [meredith_grey] continue to drink and have fun. [hank] arrives and inquires about [izzie_stevens]. [cristina_yang] tells [hank] that [izzie_stevens] is not there and won't return soon. [hank] expresses surprise at the large party for [hank]. [hank] repeatedly asks when [izzie_stevens] will show up. After the surgery, Derek asks [izzie_stevens] and [alex_karev] to care for the patient. [alex_karev] assures [izzie_stevens] he will handle it and tells [izzie_stevens] she can go to her boyfriend. [izzie_stevens] thanks [alex_karev] and looks troubled. [hank] waits outside the hospital for [izzie_stevens].
[izzie_stevens] and [hank] greet each other with a kiss.
[izzie_stevens] starts to talk about her surgery.
[hank] says [hank] did not want a big party and does not want to meet [izzie_stevens]'s coworkers.
[izzie_stevens] reminds [hank] that [hank] did not mind meeting [izzie_stevens]'s colleagues when [izzie_stevens] was a model.
[hank] replies that [izzie_stevens] used to attend her parties back then.
[izzie_stevens] insists her life has changed and her patients come first now.
[izzie_stevens] and [hank] argue about [hank] traveling a long way for [izzie_stevens] while [izzie_stevens] chose work over [hank].
[izzie_stevens] asks [hank] to come to the party, but [hank] refuses and leaves.

The next morning, the house is messy.
[george_omalley] brings a cup to [meredith_grey].
[meredith_grey] tells [george_omalley] she has to meet with the chief in an hour.
[izzie_stevens] walks in and asks about the mess.
[meredith_grey] jokingly says she shouldn't talk to [izzie_stevens] anymore, but questions why it matters since [meredith_grey] had nothing else to do.
[george_omalley] sarcastically reminds [meredith_grey] that [meredith_grey] was supposed to prepare for a meeting that could ruin [meredith_grey].
[meredith_grey] and [izzie_stevens] then discuss [mrs_patterson].
[meredith_grey] states that the heart should not have torn.
[meredith_grey] mentions that [mrs_patterson] lost 50 pounds and was in great shape.
[izzie_stevens] thinks about whether losing 50 pounds in a year affected [mrs_patterson]'s muscle mass.
[meredith_grey] is at a meeting.
Meanwhile, [george_omalley], [izzie_stevens], and [cristina_yang] are betting on the meeting's outcome.
