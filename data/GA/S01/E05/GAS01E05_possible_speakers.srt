142
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:54,651
Doctor (likely George or Meredith) / Jerry Frost (PVM): Well, you check the database for history, refer to a program, and discharge.

143
00:06:54,932 --> 00:06:56,052
Doctor (likely George or Meredith) / Jerry Frost (PVM): After you give him something.

144
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,869
Doctor (likely George or Meredith) / Jerry Frost (PVM): That's exactly what he wants.

145
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:00,612
Doctor (likely George or Meredith) / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Chunky or not, you still have to treat his pain as if it were real.

146
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:01,733
Doctor (likely George or Meredith) / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Why?

147
00:07:01,774 --> 00:07:03,136
Doctor (likely George or Meredith) / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): It's the first rule in pain management.

148
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:04,778
Doctor (likely George or Meredith) / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Always err on the side of caution.

149
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:05,798
Doctor (likely George or Meredith) / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): He's in our care.

150
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:07,161
Doctor (likely George or Meredith) / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): He says he's in pain.

151
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:07,961
Doctor (likely George or Meredith) / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Start a central line.

152
00:07:07,982 --> 00:07:08,843
Doctor (likely George or Meredith) / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): His veins are shot.

153
00:07:17,632 --> 00:07:22,579
Patient (likely Mrs. Drake) / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): The surgery before was supposed to help, but it never felt right.

154
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:25,062
Doctor (likely George or Meredith) / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Probably would have been a good idea to quit smoking.

155
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:26,093
Patient (likely Mrs. Drake) / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I did.

156
00:07:26,774 --> 00:07:27,995
Patient (likely Mrs. Drake) / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Poor pack of day habit.

157
00:07:28,456 --> 00:07:29,098
Patient (likely Mrs. Drake) / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Oh, it was hell.

158
00:07:29,278 --> 00:07:30,298
Doctor (likely George or Meredith) / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Here you go, Mrs. Drake.

159
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,480
Mrs. Drake: Didn't do any damn good.

160
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,362
George / Mr. Sturman OR Mrs. Drake (PVM): Really?

161
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:37,170
George / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Because it looked, I mean, from the damage, we all thought you probably were still smoking.

162
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:38,151
Mrs. Drake: Cold turkey.

163
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:40,875
Mrs. Drake: Five years ago, what'd I get for my trouble?

164
00:07:41,576 --> 00:07:43,558
Mrs. Drake: I still had to quit my job at the restaurant.

165
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:45,000
Mrs. Drake: But even sitting, it hurt.

166
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:46,442
George / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Here you go.

167
00:07:46,463 --> 00:07:47,283
Mrs. Drake: Nobody believed me.

168
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:48,504
Mrs. Drake: They all said it was in my head.

169
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:49,908
George / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I've seen the films.

170
00:07:50,588 --> 00:07:51,550
George / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): It's not all in your head.

171
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,673
Mrs. Drake: You're right about that.

172
00:07:53,713 --> 00:07:55,115
Mrs. Drake: Hey, come here.

173
00:07:56,528 --> 00:07:58,271
Mrs. Drake: You're too damn young to be a doctor.

174
00:07:58,752 --> 00:07:59,072
George / Mrs. Drake (PVM): Hey.

175
00:08:01,216 --> 00:08:01,336
Mrs. Drake: What?

176
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,437
Dr. George O'Malley: I'm older than I look.

177
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:06,242
Mrs. Drake: Do you think this is going to work this time?

178
00:08:06,262 --> 00:08:07,882
Dr. George O'Malley: I think it's your best option.

179
00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:09,985
Mrs. Drake: Great shooter, huh?

180
00:08:10,004 --> 00:08:10,567
Dr. George O'Malley: Yes, ma'am.

181
00:08:10,987 --> 00:08:25,204
Mrs. Drake: I like that.

182
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,620
George / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Hi, Mr. Patterson.

183
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:30,901
Mr. Patterson: Hi.

184
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:32,484
George / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Hemodynamic stable?

185
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:35,167
Other Intern / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Yeah, MAP is stayed around 8, cardiac output at 5.

186
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:37,408
Senior Doctor / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Mr. Patterson (PVM): That's good, Dr. Gray.

187
00:08:37,427 --> 00:08:38,671
George / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): That's fine, Mr. Patterson.

188
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,413
Mr. Patterson: But it's not good.

189
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:43,355
George / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Well, heart surgery takes a lot out of the patient.

190
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:47,418
Doctor (possibly Meredith or another intern/resident) / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): But we're monitoring your wife very carefully, and she should be fine.

191
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:55,086
Doctor (possibly Meredith or another intern/resident) / Mrs. Drake (PVM): Mr. Sturman, let's see about getting you out of here today.

192
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:56,710
Doctor (possibly Meredith or another intern/resident) / Mrs. Drake (PVM): How you feeling?

193
00:08:57,652 --> 00:09:01,437
Mr. Sturman: Pretty OK, except I don't think I ever want to have a bowel obstruction again.

194
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:02,076
Doctor (possibly Meredith or another intern/resident) / Mr. Sturman OR Mrs. Drake (PVM): Really?

195
00:09:02,118 --> 00:09:05,240
Doctor (possibly Meredith or another intern/resident) / Mr. Sturman OR Mrs. Drake (PVM): Wow, because we get people in here all the time requesting them.

196
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:08,105
Doctor (possibly Meredith or another intern/resident) / Mrs. Drake (PVM): So you're keeping non-clear fluids?

197
00:09:08,846 --> 00:09:11,528
Doctor (possibly Meredith or another intern/resident) / Mrs. Drake (PVM): And my all-time favorite question to ask a patient, have you pooped yet?

198
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:13,672
Mr. Sturman: I'm not exactly sure.

199
00:09:13,692 --> 00:09:16,754
Doctor (possibly Meredith or another intern/resident) / Mr. Sturman OR Mrs. Drake (PVM): I think you probably know.

200
00:09:16,774 --> 00:09:19,057
Doctor (possibly Meredith or another intern/resident) / Mrs. Drake (PVM): Past gas?

201
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:20,480
Mr. Sturman: Yes.

202
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,743
Doctor (possibly Meredith or another intern/resident) / Mrs. Drake (PVM): Really, yes?

203
00:09:21,981 --> 00:09:23,524
Doctor (possibly Meredith or another intern/resident) / Mrs. Drake (PVM): Because if I bring in my handy lie detector.

204
00:09:23,644 --> 00:09:24,485
Mr. Sturman: OK, no.

205
00:09:25,596 --> 00:09:28,058
Mr. Sturman: I shouldn't try and lie, I know.

206
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:29,581
Mr. Sturman: I went to medical school.

207
00:09:30,423 --> 00:09:31,163
Doctor (possibly Meredith or another intern/resident) / Mrs. Drake (PVM): You went to med school?

208
00:09:31,764 --> 00:09:33,605
Mr. Sturman: Yeah, dropped out my last year of clinical.

209
00:09:34,605 --> 00:09:38,951
Mr. Sturman: Too many hours, and I was staring into the ice-cold eyes of divorce.

210
00:09:39,253 --> 00:09:39,451
Doctor (possibly Meredith or another intern/resident) / Jerry Frost (PVM): Wow.

211
00:09:41,254 --> 00:09:41,355
Mr. Sturman: Yeah.

212
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,639
Mr. Sturman: I do research now, and I have a life, a family.

213
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,519
Mr. Sturman: No offense.

214
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,981
Doctor (possibly Meredith or another intern/resident) / Mr. Sturman OR Mrs. Drake (PVM): You know, I mean... Oh, no, no.

215
00:09:48,423 --> 00:09:49,604
Doctor (possibly Meredith or another intern/resident) / Mrs. Drake (PVM): Um, that's okay.

216
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:52,447
Doctor (possibly Meredith or another intern/resident) / Mr. Sturman OR Mrs. Drake (PVM): I'm just one of those people who believe you can have both.

217
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,629
Mr. Sturman: Maybe so.

218
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:56,850
Mr. Sturman: But your first responsibility is always going to be your patient.

219
00:09:58,481 --> 00:09:58,725
Doctor (possibly Meredith or another intern/resident) / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Dr. Shepard?

425
00:20:17,403 --> 00:20:18,306

641
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:12,689

671
00:32:15,622 --> 00:32:17,064

676
00:32:27,318 --> 00:32:28,961
Meredith Grey / Mrs. Drake (PVM): Why don't you meet some of the people I work with?

677
00:32:29,868 --> 00:32:32,093

685
00:32:53,737 --> 00:32:57,902
Meredith Grey / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): I can't always show up to my own parties on time, and my patients have to come first.

686
00:32:58,102 --> 00:33:03,028
Hank / Jerry Frost OR Mrs. Drake (PVM): Yeah, I just flew across the entire country, and there's a hundred people at your house.

687
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:04,809

688
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:07,094

695
00:33:38,272 --> 00:33:50,990
Unknown (Song Lyric) / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): In a place I dream about where the sun never goes out and the sky is deep and blue, won't you take me there with you?

696
00:33:56,692 --> 00:34:02,126
Unknown (Song Lyric) / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Shade our skin like the sun's shining

697
00:34:28,788 --> 00:34:30,590
Cristina / Dr. Alex Karev OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): You know, in some states you get arrested for that.

698
00:34:44,614 --> 00:34:46,257
Derek / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): So you blew me off for a bottle of tequila.

699
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:48,001
Meredith / Dr. Alex Karev OR Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): Tequila's no good for you.

700
00:34:48,621 --> 00:34:50,143
Derek / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): Doesn't call, doesn't write.

701
00:34:50,164 --> 00:34:52,027
Meredith / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): It's not nearly as much fun to wake up to.

702
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:14,463
Meredith / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Take me for a ride, Derek.

703
00:35:14,483 --> 00:35:17,608

705
00:35:17,827 --> 00:35:18,329

00:35:18,527 --> 00:35:18,909
Meredith / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): What?

707
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,731
Derek / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): You should probably sneak inside, though.

708
00:35:22,112 --> 00:35:24,117
Meredith / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): We did enough sneaking for the night.

709
00:35:24,137 --> 00:35:26,000
Derek / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): It was good sneaking, but enough sneaking.

710
00:35:26,061 --> 00:35:27,282
Meredith / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Yeah, I say we're pretty good sneakers.

711
00:35:33,614 --> 00:35:35,639
Cristina / Jerry Frost (PVM): You mind moving this tail wagon?

712
00:35:35,659 --> 00:35:36,681
Cristina / Jerry Frost (PVM): You're blocking me in.

713
00:35:40,527 --> 00:35:42,552
Izzie / Mr. Patterson OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Apparently not good enough.

714
00:36:11,286 --> 00:36:12,588
Cristina / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): When's your meeting with the chief?

715
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:15,791
Meredith / Mrs. Drake (PVM): In an hour.

716
00:36:21,356 --> 00:36:22,737
Izzie / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Holy mother of destruction.

717
00:36:23,697 --> 00:36:26,679
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): You missed Dr. Palooza.

718
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:28,201
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Apparently, you didn't.

719
00:36:29,242 --> 00:36:31,184
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I should probably never speak to you again.

720
00:36:31,204 --> 00:36:33,806
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Mrs. Drake (PVM): I'm so sorry, Meredith.

721
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:37,750
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Mrs. Drake (PVM): I had no idea it was going to get so.

722
00:36:37,768 --> 00:36:37,949
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): It's OK.

723
00:36:38,971 --> 00:36:40,652
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Really, I don't care.

724
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,492
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): What would I be doing anyway?

725
00:36:42,914 --> 00:36:44,856
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Preparing for your career-altering meeting.

726
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:46,518
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Sorry.

727
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:48,101
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): That heart wall shouldn't have torn.

728
00:36:48,121 --> 00:36:50,405
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Anything in the patient's history?

729
00:36:51,847 --> 00:36:54,130
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Husband said she was in the best shape of her life.

730
00:36:55,092 --> 00:36:56,755
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): She lost 100 pounds last year.

731
00:36:56,775 --> 00:36:59,056
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): 100 pounds in a year?

732
00:36:59,077 --> 00:37:00,440
Dr. Burke / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): How's her muscle mass?

733
00:37:04,485 --> 00:37:05,887
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Do you even know whose that was?

734
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,331
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I'm hoping it was yours.

735
00:37:09,373 --> 00:37:09,693
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): No.

736
00:37:13,706 --> 00:37:14,268
Chief Webber / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): What do you think?

737
00:37:15,974 --> 00:37:20,168
Alex Karev / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): 50 says Meredith gets tossed out on her ass, and Burke walks away clean.

738
00:37:20,188 --> 00:37:21,472
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Please be nice to her.

739
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:28,077
Dr. Meredith Grey: So I have done a lot of research on this, and Dr. Burke has been kind enough to help me.

740
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:32,224
Dr. Meredith Grey: And I understand my responsibility and what I've done wrong here.

741
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:36,989
Dr. Meredith Grey: However, I do think the patient's history is significant in this case.

742
00:37:37,331 --> 00:37:41,016
Dr. Meredith Grey: She still weighs 200 pounds, which is why no one even noticed it.

743
00:37:41,496 --> 00:37:44,641
Dr. Meredith Grey: But with that kind of a weight drop, it doesn't matter how much you weigh.

744
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,322
Dr. Meredith Grey: Technically, you're anorexic.

745
00:37:46,342 --> 00:37:49,067
Dr. Meredith Grey: So along with all that fat, she was losing muscle, heart muscle.

746
00:37:49,447 --> 00:37:52,692
Dr. Meredith Grey: That certainly could be the reason for a small poke to become a large tear.

747
00:37:52,672 --> 00:37:54,494
Chief Webber / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): That still doesn't change the fact, though.

748
00:37:54,554 --> 00:37:57,715
Hospital Administrator / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): The small poke wasn't reported by Dr. Gray at the time of the occurrence.

749
00:37:58,077 --> 00:37:59,277
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): And if I could change that?

750
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:00,237
Hospital Administrator / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): And you can't.

751
00:38:00,858 --> 00:38:04,061
Hospital Administrator / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): You've left yourself and the hospital open to a tremendous amount of liability.

752
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:04,501
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Oh, no, no.

753
00:38:04,521 --> 00:38:06,322
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Not if the patient's weight loss caused the problem.

754
00:38:06,342 --> 00:38:06,784
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I'm sorry.

755
00:38:06,902 --> 00:38:08,284
Hospital Administrator / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): I have no choice here other than to rectify.

756
00:38:08,304 --> 00:38:09,226
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): I've spoken to the husband.

757
00:38:09,525 --> 00:38:15,010
Hospital Administrator / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): And I believe that as long as his wife remains stable, I can't take your beliefs to the bank, Dr. Burke.

758
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,911
Hospital Administrator / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Mr. Patterson (PVM): Dr. Gray made a huge error.

759
00:38:16,952 --> 00:38:17,713
Dr. Burke / Mr. Patterson (PVM): And she reported it.

760
00:38:17,873 --> 00:38:18,454
Hospital Administrator / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Too late.

761
00:38:18,893 --> 00:38:20,393
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): And in front of the patient's husband.

762
00:38:20,815 --> 00:38:21,576
Cristina Yang / Mr. Patterson (PVM): But she reported it.

763
00:38:21,655 --> 00:38:22,577
Cristina Yang / Mr. Patterson (PVM): She spoke up.

764
00:38:26,623 --> 00:38:33,570
Dr. Preston Burke: Five years ago, as a CT fellow, I had a nagging feeling that I didn't check the body cavity of a lung patient closely enough before I closed.

765
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:36,735
Dr. Preston Burke: The patient seemed fine post-op, and I was in a hurry.

766
00:38:39,097 --> 00:38:43,282
Dr. Preston Burke: And yesterday, you and Dr. Bailey pulled a towel out from under that patient's lung.

767
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:46,846
Dr. Preston Burke: Why didn't I report it at an appropriate time?

768
00:38:46,905 --> 00:38:54,454
Dr. Preston Burke: Maybe because I was afraid that I would be called into a meeting where some hospital lawyer's fear of liability could end my career.

769
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,271
Dr. Preston Burke: Even great doctors make mistakes.

770
00:38:57,552 --> 00:39:02,260
Dr. Preston Burke: And when we do, we've got to have a chance to be able to speak up without fear of retribution.

771
00:39:03,663 --> 00:39:04,422
Dr. Preston Burke: Or everyone suffers.

772
00:39:05,545 --> 00:39:06,585
Dr. Preston Burke: Dr. Gray spoke up.

773
00:39:19,347 --> 00:39:20,329
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Responsibility.

774
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,431
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): It really does suck.

775
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,947
Cristina Yang / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Meredith, you OK?

776
00:39:29,088 --> 00:39:30,469
Dr. Meredith Grey: Yeah, one month probation.

777
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:31,391
Cristina Yang / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Good.

778
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:31,773
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): That's good.

779
00:39:31,793 --> 00:39:32,012
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Yeah.

780
00:39:32,672 --> 00:39:34,438
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Burke saved my ass in there.

781
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:35,960
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Don't you all have something better to do?

782
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:36,922
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Come on, people, move.

783
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:41,592
Cristina Yang / Jerry Frost (PVM): He was always going to tell them about the towel.

784
00:39:42,052 --> 00:39:43,454
Cristina Yang / Jerry Frost (PVM): Just wanted to wait for the right time.

785
00:39:44,076 --> 00:39:45,940
Cristina Yang / Jerry Frost (PVM): Information is power.

786
00:40:08,701 --> 00:40:27,619
Dr. Meredith Grey: Unfortunately, once you get past the age of braces and training bras, responsibility doesn't go away.

787
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:29,420
Rehab Counselor / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): Jerry, this is Sloan.

788
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:36,887
Rehab Counselor / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): She's here to talk to you, if you want, about options for rehab.

789
00:40:36,907 --> 00:40:38,268
Dr. Meredith Grey: It can't be avoided.

790
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:47,340
Dr. Meredith Grey: Mrs. Drake, I cannot begin to tell you how truly sorry I am.

791
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:53,208
Dr. Meredith Grey: Either someone makes us face it, or we suffer the consequences.

792
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:55,952
Nurse / Mr. Sturman (PVM): Easy.

793
00:40:55,972 --> 00:41:05,143
Mr. Sturman: I did it.

794
00:41:05,164 --> 00:41:07,248
Mr. Sturman: I pooped.

795
00:41:07,387 --> 00:41:09,471
Nurse / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): All right.

796
00:41:13,788 --> 00:41:31,514
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Meredith Grey OR Jerry Frost (PVM): Missed your party?

797
00:41:31,534 --> 00:41:31,893
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Life as a surgeon.

798
00:41:31,914 --> 00:41:32,516
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): And loving every minute of it.

799
00:41:32,536 --> 00:41:33,257
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): You watch TV, and pass me the phone.

800
00:41:33,277 --> 00:41:33,717
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I need a conversation.

801
00:41:33,737 --> 00:41:34,559
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): You're feeling down, just like this town.

802
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:35,018
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): And your eyes say, oh.

803
00:41:37,378 --> 00:41:41,364
Dr. Meredith Grey: And still, adulthood has its perks.

804
00:41:41,784 --> 00:41:44,206
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Thanks for the coffee.

805
00:41:44,226 --> 00:41:51,315
Dr. Meredith Grey: The kind who'd take her clothes off and sit in a room full of frozen faces.

806
00:41:54,759 --> 00:42:00,724
Cristina Yang / Mr. Sturman (PVM): I heard she went to find God in the Indian subcontinent.

807
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:04,768
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Mr. Sturman (PVM): It's mad she had to go so far.

808
00:42:06,353 --> 00:42:11,023
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I mean the shoes, the sex, the no parents anywhere telling you what to do.

809
00:42:15,572 --> 00:42:26,235
Dr. Meredith Grey: That's pretty damn good.
