161
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:37,170

162
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:38,151
Mrs. Drake: Cold turkey.

163
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:40,875

Izzie Stevens / Dr. Addison Montgomery OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I'm so sorry, Meredith.

721
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:37,750
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I had no idea it was going to get so.

722
00:36:37,768 --> 00:36:37,949
Dr. Meredith Gray: It's OK.

723
00:36:38,971 --> 00:36:40,652
Dr. Meredith Gray: Really, I don't care.

724
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,492
Dr. Meredith Gray: What would I be doing anyway?

725
00:36:42,914 --> 00:36:44,856
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Preparing for your career-altering meeting.

726
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:46,518
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Sorry.

727
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:48,101
Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): That heart wall shouldn't have torn.

728
00:36:48,121 --> 00:36:50,405
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Anything in the patient's history?

729
00:36:51,847 --> 00:36:54,130
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Husband said she was in the best shape of her life.

730
00:36:55,092 --> 00:36:56,755
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): She lost 100 pounds last year.

731
00:36:56,775 --> 00:36:59,056
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): 100 pounds in a year?

732
00:36:59,077 --> 00:37:00,440
Burke / Mrs. Drake OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): How's her muscle mass?

733
00:37:04,485 --> 00:37:05,887
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Do you even know whose that was?

734
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,331
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Addison Montgomery (PVM): I'm hoping it was yours.

735
00:37:09,373 --> 00:37:09,693
Cristina Yang / Dr. Addison Montgomery (PVM): No.

736
00:37:13,706 --> 00:37:14,268
Burke / Dr. Addison Montgomery OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): What do you think?

737
00:37:15,974 --> 00:37:20,168
Alex Karev / Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): 50 says Meredith gets tossed out on her ass, and Burke walks away clean.

738
00:37:20,188 --> 00:37:21,472
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Please be nice to her.

739
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:28,077
Dr. Meredith Gray: So I have done a lot of research on this, and Dr. Burke has been kind enough to help me.

740
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:32,224
Dr. Meredith Gray: And I understand my responsibility and what I've done wrong here.

741
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:36,989
Dr. Meredith Gray: However, I do think the patient's history is significant in this case.

742
00:37:37,331 --> 00:37:41,016
Dr. Meredith Gray: She still weighs 200 pounds, which is why no one even noticed it.

743
00:37:41,496 --> 00:37:44,641
Dr. Meredith Gray: But with that kind of a weight drop, it doesn't matter how much you weigh.

744
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,322
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Mr. Patterson (PVM): Technically, you're anorexic.

745
00:37:46,342 --> 00:37:49,067
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Mr. Patterson (PVM): So along with all that fat, she was losing muscle, heart muscle.

746
00:37:49,447 --> 00:37:52,692
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Mr. Patterson (PVM): That certainly could be the reason for a small poke to become a large tear.

747
00:37:52,672 --> 00:37:54,494
Hospital Lawyer / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): That still doesn't change the fact, though.

748
00:37:54,554 --> 00:37:57,715
Hospital Lawyer / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): The small poke wasn't reported by Dr. Gray at the time of the occurrence.

749
00:37:58,077 --> 00:37:59,277
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): And if I could change that?

750
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:00,237
Hospital Lawyer / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): And you can't.

751
00:38:00,858 --> 00:38:04,061
Hospital Lawyer / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): You've left yourself and the hospital open to a tremendous amount of liability.

752
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:04,501
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Oh, no, no.

753
00:38:04,521 --> 00:38:06,322
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Not if the patient's weight loss caused the problem.

754
00:38:06,342 --> 00:38:06,784
Hospital Lawyer / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I'm sorry.

755
00:38:06,902 --> 00:38:08,284
Hospital Lawyer / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): I have no choice here other than to rectify.

756
00:38:08,304 --> 00:38:09,226
Hospital Lawyer / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): I've spoken to the husband.

757
00:38:09,525 --> 00:38:15,010
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): And I believe that as long as his wife remains stable, I can't take your beliefs to the bank, Dr. Burke.

758
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,911
Hospital Lawyer / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Dr. Gray made a huge error.

759
00:38:16,952 --> 00:38:17,713
Dr. Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): And she reported it.

760
00:38:17,873 --> 00:38:18,454
Hospital Lawyer / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Too late.

761
00:38:18,893 --> 00:38:20,393
Hospital Lawyer / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): And in front of the patient's husband.

762
00:38:20,815 --> 00:38:21,576
Dr. Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): But she reported it.

763
00:38:21,655 --> 00:38:22,577
Dr. Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): She spoke up.

764
00:38:26,623 --> 00:38:33,570
Dr. Preston Burke: Five years ago, as a CT fellow, I had a nagging feeling that I didn't check the body cavity of a lung patient closely enough before I closed.

765
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:36,735
Dr. Preston Burke: The patient seemed fine post-op, and I was in a hurry.

766
00:38:39,097 --> 00:38:43,282
Dr. Preston Burke: And yesterday, you and Dr. Bailey pulled a towel out from under that patient's lung.

767
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:46,846
Dr. Preston Burke: Why didn't I report it at an appropriate time?

768
00:38:46,905 --> 00:38:54,454
Dr. Preston Burke: Maybe because I was afraid that I would be called into a meeting where some hospital lawyer's fear of liability could end my career.

769
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,271
Dr. Preston Burke: Even great doctors make mistakes.

770
00:38:57,552 --> 00:39:02,260
Dr. Preston Burke: And when we do, we've got to have a chance to be able to speak up without fear of retribution.

771
00:39:03,663 --> 00:39:04,422
Dr. Preston Burke: Or everyone suffers.

772
00:39:05,545 --> 00:39:06,585
Dr. Preston Burke: Dr. Gray spoke up.

773
00:39:19,347 --> 00:39:20,329
Dr. Meredith Gray: Responsibility.

774
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,431
Dr. Meredith Gray: It really does suck.

775
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,947
Cristina Yang / Jerry Frost (PVM): Meredith, you OK?

776
00:39:29,088 --> 00:39:30,469
Dr. Meredith Gray: Yeah, one month probation.

777
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:31,391
Meredith Grey / Jerry Frost (PVM): Good.

778
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:31,773
Cristina Yang / Jerry Frost OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): That's good.

779
00:39:31,793 --> 00:39:32,012
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Yeah.

780
00:39:32,672 --> 00:39:34,438
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Burke saved my ass in there.

781
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:35,960
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Don't you all have something better to do?

782
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:36,922
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Come on, people, move.

783
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:41,592
Cristina Yang / Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): He was always going to tell them about the towel.

784
00:39:42,052 --> 00:39:43,454
Cristina Yang / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Just wanted to wait for the right time.

785
00:39:44,076 --> 00:39:45,940
Cristina Yang / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Information is power.

786
00:40:08,701 --> 00:40:27,619
Dr. Meredith Gray: Unfortunately, once you get past the age of braces and training bras, responsibility doesn't go away.

787
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:29,420
Doctor (possibly Meredith Grey) / Hank (PVM): Jerry, this is Sloan.

788
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:36,887
Doctor (possibly Meredith Grey) / Hank OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): She's here to talk to you, if you want, about options for rehab.

789
00:40:36,907 --> 00:40:38,268
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): It can't be avoided.

790
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:47,340
Doctor (possibly George O'Malley) / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Preston Burke OR Mr. Patterson (PVM): Mrs. Drake, I cannot begin to tell you how truly sorry I am.

791
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:53,208
Dr. Meredith Gray: Either someone makes us face it, or we suffer the consequences.

792
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:55,952
Doctor or Nurse (possibly Miranda Bailey) / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Easy.

793
00:40:55,972 --> 00:41:05,143
Jerry Frost: I did it.

794
00:41:05,164 --> 00:41:07,248
Jerry Frost: I pooped.

795
00:41:07,387 --> 00:41:09,471
Doctor or Nurse (possibly Izzie Stevens) / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): All right.

796
00:41:13,788 --> 00:41:31,514
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): Missed your party?

797
00:41:31,534 --> 00:41:31,893
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Life as a surgeon.

798
00:41:31,914 --> 00:41:32,516
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): And loving every minute of it.

799
00:41:32,536 --> 00:41:33,257
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You watch TV, and pass me the phone.

800
00:41:33,277 --> 00:41:33,717
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I need a conversation.

801
00:41:33,737 --> 00:41:34,559
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You're feeling down, just like this town.

802
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:35,018
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): And your eyes say, oh.

803
00:41:37,378 --> 00:41:41,364
Dr. Meredith Gray: And still, adulthood has its perks.

804
00:41:41,784 --> 00:41:44,206
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Thanks for the coffee.

805
00:41:44,226 --> 00:41:51,315
Dr. Meredith Gray: The kind who'd take her clothes off and sit in a room full of frozen faces.

806
00:41:54,759 --> 00:42:00,724
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I heard she went to find God in the Indian subcontinent.

807
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:04,768
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): It's mad she had to go so far.

808
00:42:06,353 --> 00:42:11,023
Dr. Meredith Gray: I mean the shoes, the sex, the no parents anywhere telling you what to do.

809
00:42:15,572 --> 00:42:26,235
Dr. Meredith Gray: That's pretty damn good.
