00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:53,249

117
00:05:48,663 --> 00:05:50,644

118
00:05:50,925 --> 00:05:56,211
Attending Doctor / Patient (Second Patient) (PVM): Says here we operated on her back in 99, so Mrs. Drake has been through this before, but talk her through it anyway.

121
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:07,127
Intern (possibly George) / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): So do you think if they put a picture of these in a pack of cigarettes, people would stop smoking?

122
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:14,314

124
00:06:14,856 --> 00:06:17,139

125
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,401

126
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:19,884

127
00:06:20,084 --> 00:06:21,064

128
00:06:21,105 --> 00:06:24,670

129
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,394

130
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:29,036

131
00:06:29,576 --> 00:06:30,858

132
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:34,723
Patient: Demerol or Dilaudid, a ton of Dilaudid.

133
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:36,326
Patient: That'll set me straight.

134
00:06:36,346 --> 00:06:38,009
Intern (possibly George) / Patient (PVM): The standard starting dose is two.

135
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:40,151

136
00:06:40,951 --> 00:06:41,012
Intern (possibly George) / Unknown (PVM): Hm?

137
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,576
Patient: Pow, pow, pow.

138
00:06:43,596 --> 00:06:45,978
Intern (possibly George) / Patient (PVM): Exaggerated and overly specific description of his pain.

139
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,444

140
00:06:49,463 --> 00:06:50,564
Intern (possibly George) / Patient (PVM): He's a Dilaudid junkie.

141
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:51,286
Attending / Patient (PVM): So what do you do?

142
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:54,651
Intern (possibly George) / Patient (PVM): Well, you check the database for history, refer to a program, and discharge.

143
00:06:54,932 --> 00:06:56,052
Another Intern / Patient OR Mr. Jerry Frost (PVM): After you give him something.

144
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,869
Attending / Patient (PVM): That's exactly what he wants.

145

147

153
00:07:17,632 --> 00:07:22,579

154
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:25,062

156
00:07:26,774 --> 00:07:27,995

161
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:37,170
Intern / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Because it looked, I mean, from the damage, we all thought you probably were still smoking.

162
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:38,151
Male Patient: Cold turkey.

163
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:40,875

164
00:07:41,576 --> 00:07:43,558
Male Patient: I still had to quit my job at the restaurant.

165
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:45,000

170
00:07:50,588 --> 00:07:51,550

173
00:07:56,528 --> 00:07:58,271

178
00:08:06,262 --> 00:08:07,882
Intern / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I think it's your best option.

179
00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:09,985

180

188
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,413

189
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:43,355
Dr. Gray / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Well, heart surgery takes a lot out of the patient.

190
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:47,418
Dr. Gray / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): But we're monitoring your wife very carefully, and she should be fine.

00:09:02,118 --> 00:09:05,240
Intern / Patient (Second Patient) OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Wow, because we get people in here all the time requesting them.

196
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:08,105

205
00:09:25,596 --> 00:09:28,058

689
00:33:07,933 --> 00:33:16,846

695
00:33:38,272 --> 00:33:50,990

696
00:33:56,692 --> 00:34:02,126
Unknown (Song Lyrics) / Narrator (PVM): Shade our skin like the sun's shining

697
00:34:28,788 --> 00:34:30,590

698
00:34:44,614 --> 00:34:46,257

699
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:48,001

700
00:34:48,621 --> 00:34:50,143

701
00:34:50,164 --> 00:34:52,027

702
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:14,463

703
00:35:14,483 --> 00:35:17,608

707
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,731
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Mr. Jerry Frost (PVM): You should probably sneak inside, though.

708
00:35:22,112 --> 00:35:24,117

709
00:35:24,137 --> 00:35:26,000

710
00:35:26,061 --> 00:35:27,282

711
00:35:33,614 --> 00:35:35,639

712
00:35:35,659 --> 00:35:36,681

713
00:35:40,527 --> 00:35:42,552
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Burke (PVM): Apparently not good enough.

714
00:36:11,286 --> 00:36:12,588

715
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:15,791

716
00:36:21,356 --> 00:36:22,737

717
00:36:23,697 --> 00:36:26,679

718
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:28,201

719
00:36:29,242 --> 00:36:31,184

720
00:36:31,204 --> 00:36:33,806

721
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:37,750

722
00:36:37,768 --> 00:36:37,949
Dr. Meredith Gray: It's OK.

723
00:36:38,971 --> 00:36:40,652
Dr. Meredith Gray: Really, I don't care.

724
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,492
Dr. Meredith Gray: What would I be doing anyway?

725
00:36:42,914 --> 00:36:44,856
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Preparing for your career-altering meeting.

726
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:46,518
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Sorry.

727
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:48,101
Dr. Meredith Gray: That heart wall shouldn't have torn.

728
00:36:48,121 --> 00:36:50,405
Dr. Richard Webber / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Anything in the patient's history?

729
00:36:51,847 --> 00:36:54,130
Dr. Meredith Gray: Husband said she was in the best shape of her life.

730
00:36:55,092 --> 00:36:56,755
Dr. Meredith Gray: She lost 100 pounds last year.

731
00:36:56,775 --> 00:36:59,056
Dr. Richard Webber / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): 100 pounds in a year?

732
00:36:59,077 --> 00:37:00,440
Dr. Richard Webber / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): How's her muscle mass?

733
00:37:04,485 --> 00:37:05,887
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Do you even know whose that was?

734
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,331
Alex Karev / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): I'm hoping it was yours.

735
00:37:09,373 --> 00:37:09,693
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): No.

736
00:37:13,706 --> 00:37:14,268
Alex Karev / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): What do you think?

737
00:37:15,974 --> 00:37:20,168
Alex Karev / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): 50 says Meredith gets tossed out on her ass, and Burke walks away clean.

738
00:37:20,188 --> 00:37:21,472
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Please be nice to her.

739
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:28,077
Dr. Meredith Gray: So I have done a lot of research on this, and Dr. Burke has been kind enough to help me.

740
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:32,224
Dr. Meredith Gray: And I understand my responsibility and what I've done wrong here.

741
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:36,989
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): However, I do think the patient's history is significant in this case.

742
00:37:37,331 --> 00:37:41,016
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): She still weighs 200 pounds, which is why no one even noticed it.

743
00:37:41,496 --> 00:37:44,641
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): But with that kind of a weight drop, it doesn't matter how much you weigh.

744
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,322
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Burke OR Patient (Second Patient) (PVM): Technically, you're anorexic.

745
00:37:46,342 --> 00:37:49,067
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Burke OR Patient (Second Patient) (PVM): So along with all that fat, she was losing muscle, heart muscle.

746
00:37:49,447 --> 00:37:52,692
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Patient (Second Patient) (PVM): That certainly could be the reason for a small poke to become a large tear.

747
00:37:52,672 --> 00:37:54,494
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): That still doesn't change the fact, though.

748
00:37:54,554 --> 00:37:57,715
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): The small poke wasn't reported by Dr. Gray at the time of the occurrence.

749
00:37:58,077 --> 00:37:59,277
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): And if I could change that?

750
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:00,237
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): And you can't.

751
00:38:00,858 --> 00:38:04,061
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Burke (PVM): You've left yourself and the hospital open to a tremendous amount of liability.

752
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:04,501
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Burke (PVM): Oh, no, no.

753
00:38:04,521 --> 00:38:06,322
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Burke (PVM): Not if the patient's weight loss caused the problem.

754
00:38:06,342 --> 00:38:06,784
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I'm sorry.

755
00:38:06,902 --> 00:38:08,284
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Burke (PVM): I have no choice here other than to rectify.

756
00:38:08,304 --> 00:38:09,226
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Burke (PVM): I've spoken to the husband.

757
00:38:09,525 --> 00:38:15,010
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Burke (PVM): And I believe that as long as his wife remains stable, I can't take your beliefs to the bank, Dr. Burke.

758
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,911
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Burke (PVM): Dr. Gray made a huge error.

759
00:38:16,952 --> 00:38:17,713
Dr. Burke / Dr. Burke (PVM): And she reported it.

760
00:38:17,873 --> 00:38:18,454
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Too late.

761
00:38:18,893 --> 00:38:20,393
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): And in front of the patient's husband.

762
00:38:20,815 --> 00:38:21,576
Dr. Burke / Dr. Burke (PVM): But she reported it.

763
00:38:21,655 --> 00:38:22,577
Dr. Burke / Dr. Burke (PVM): She spoke up.

764
00:38:26,623 --> 00:38:33,570
Dr. Burke / Dr. Burke OR Dr. Burke (PVM): Five years ago, as a CT fellow, I had a nagging feeling that I didn't check the body cavity of a lung patient closely enough before I closed.

765
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:36,735
Dr. Burke / Dr. Burke OR Dr. Burke (PVM): The patient seemed fine post-op, and I was in a hurry.

766
00:38:39,097 --> 00:38:43,282
Dr. Burke / Dr. Burke (PVM): And yesterday, you and Dr. Bailey pulled a towel out from under that patient's lung.

767
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:46,846
Dr. Burke / Dr. Burke (PVM): Why didn't I report it at an appropriate time?

768
00:38:46,905 --> 00:38:54,454
Dr. Burke / Dr. Burke (PVM): Maybe because I was afraid that I would be called into a meeting where some hospital lawyer's fear of liability could end my career.

769
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,271
Dr. Burke / Dr. Burke (PVM): Even great doctors make mistakes.

770
00:38:57,552 --> 00:39:02,260
Dr. Burke / Dr. Burke OR Dr. Burke (PVM): And when we do, we've got to have a chance to be able to speak up without fear of retribution.

771
00:39:03,663 --> 00:39:04,422
Dr. Burke / Dr. Burke (PVM): Or everyone suffers.

772
00:39:05,545 --> 00:39:06,585
Dr. Burke / Mr. Patterson OR Dr. Burke (PVM): Dr. Gray spoke up.

773
00:39:19,347 --> 00:39:20,329
Meredith (Narration) / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Responsibility.

774
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,431
Meredith (Narration) / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): It really does suck.

775
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,947
Cristina Yang / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): Meredith, you OK?

776
00:39:29,088 --> 00:39:30,469
Dr. Meredith Gray: Yeah, one month probation.

777
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:31,391
Cristina Yang / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): Good.

778
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:31,773
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Alex Karev OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): That's good.

779
00:39:31,793 --> 00:39:32,012
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Yeah.

780
00:39:32,672 --> 00:39:34,438
Dr. Meredith Gray: Burke saved my ass in there.

781
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:35,960
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Mrs. Drake (PVM): Don't you all have something better to do?

782
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:36,922
Miranda Bailey / Mrs. Drake (PVM): Come on, people, move.

783
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:41,592
Cristina Yang / Mrs. Drake OR Attending Surgeon (PVM): He was always going to tell them about the towel.

784
00:39:42,052 --> 00:39:43,454
Izzie Stevens / Attending Surgeon (PVM): Just wanted to wait for the right time.

785
00:39:44,076 --> 00:39:45,940
George O'Malley / Attending Surgeon (PVM): Information is power.

786
00:40:08,701 --> 00:40:27,619
Meredith (Narration) / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Burke (PVM): Unfortunately, once you get past the age of braces and training bras, responsibility doesn't go away.

787
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:29,420
Unknown (possibly a nurse or doctor) / Dr. Burke (PVM): Jerry, this is Sloan.

788
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:36,887
Unknown (possibly same as previous line, staff member) / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Burke (PVM): She's here to talk to you, if you want, about options for rehab.

789
00:40:36,907 --> 00:40:38,268
Unknown (possibly Mark Sloan) / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): It can't be avoided.

790
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:47,340
Unknown (possibly Mark Sloan or another doctor) / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Hank OR Dr. Meredith Gray OR Patient (PVM): Mrs. Drake, I cannot begin to tell you how truly sorry I am.

791
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:53,208
Unknown (possibly Mark Sloan or another doctor) / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Hank (PVM): Either someone makes us face it, or we suffer the consequences.

792
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:55,952
Unknown / Hank (PVM): Easy.

793
00:40:55,972 --> 00:41:05,143
Unknown (possibly a patient) / Hank (PVM): I did it.

794
00:41:05,164 --> 00:41:07,248
Unknown (possibly a patient) / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Meredith Gray OR Hank (PVM): I pooped.

795
00:41:07,387 --> 00:41:09,471
Unknown (possibly a nurse or doctor) / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): All right.

796
00:41:13,788 --> 00:41:31,514
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Patient (PVM): Missed your party?

797
00:41:31,534 --> 00:41:31,893
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Life as a surgeon.

798
00:41:31,914 --> 00:41:32,516
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): And loving every minute of it.

799
00:41:32,536 --> 00:41:33,257
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You watch TV, and pass me the phone.

800
00:41:33,277 --> 00:41:33,717
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I need a conversation.

801
00:41:33,737 --> 00:41:34,559
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You're feeling down, just like this town.

802
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:35,018
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): And your eyes say, oh.

803
00:41:37,378 --> 00:41:41,364
Dr. Meredith Gray: And still, adulthood has its perks.

804
00:41:41,784 --> 00:41:44,206
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Meredith Gray OR Hank (PVM): Thanks for the coffee.

805
00:41:44,226 --> 00:41:51,315
Unknown / Hank (PVM): The kind who'd take her clothes off and sit in a room full of frozen faces.

806
00:41:54,759 --> 00:42:00,724
Unknown / Hank (PVM): I heard she went to find God in the Indian subcontinent.

807
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:04,768
Unknown / Hank (PVM): It's mad she had to go so far.

808
00:42:06,353 --> 00:42:11,023
Dr. Meredith Gray: I mean the shoes, the sex, the no parents anywhere telling you what to do.

809
00:42:15,572 --> 00:42:26,235
Dr. Meredith Gray: That's pretty damn good.
