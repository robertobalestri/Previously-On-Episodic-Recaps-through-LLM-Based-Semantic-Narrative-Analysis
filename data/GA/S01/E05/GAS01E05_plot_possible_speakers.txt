Meredith Grey begins the episode reflecting on the burdens of adulthood, contrasting it with the simpler worries of childhood. She laments the responsibilities that come with being an adult, especially as a surgical intern, and notes that adulthood is overrated.

Meredith is approached by a lawyer who informs her that her mother’s Alzheimer's is advancing. The lawyer explains that while her mother is still lucid enough to consent, she needs to sign over her estate to Meredith. Overwhelmed, Meredith protests, asking if someone else can handle it, but is told that as her daughter, the responsibility falls to her.

At the hospital, Meredith is preparing for her first heart surgery. She is exhausted from lack of sleep and is missing rounds. During the surgery, she holds Mrs. Patterson’s heart, but her hands slip. Dr. Burke, the attending surgeon, instructs her to gently release the heart and finish the procedure. Meredith internally compares the gravity of this responsibility to the trivial concerns of childhood.

After surgery, Cristina Yang expresses envy that Meredith got to hold a heart, joking that even a monkey could do it. The interns discuss an upcoming party at Meredith’s house, with Cristina and Izzie Stevens debating the guest list. Izzie wants her boyfriend Hank to meet her friends, but Cristina teases her about the party and Hank’s sexual prowess. Alex Karev and George O’Malley join in, and it becomes clear that the party is growing beyond Meredith’s knowledge or approval.

Later, in the hospital, the team faces a crisis when Mrs. Patterson’s heart stops responding after surgery. The surgical team, led by Dr. Burke, works to resuscitate her, eventually restoring her rhythm. Meredith worries she may have damaged the heart during surgery, confessing to George that she nodded off and may have squeezed it or punctured it with her fingernail. George reassures her that Mrs. Patterson is stable and that nothing happened.

Meanwhile, George is assigned to Mrs. Drake, a patient with chronic back pain and a history of lung surgery. He suspects a patient, Jerry Frost, is a drug seeker, but is reminded by an attending that pain must be treated as real regardless of suspicion. Alex is instructed to start a central line on Jerry, whose veins are damaged from previous treatments.

Mrs. Drake’s surgery reveals a towel left inside her from a previous operation five years ago. Cristina and George are tasked with investigating who was responsible for the oversight. Mrs. Drake is upset upon learning about the towel, and Cristina is told by a senior doctor to keep the matter quiet while it is sorted out.

Izzie and Alex have a tense exchange about the party and their relationship. Alex asks Izzie to dinner, but she declines, citing the party. Alex is annoyed about not being invited. Meanwhile, Meredith is called away to deal with her mother’s legal paperwork, leaving the party preparations in the hands of her friends.

At the hospital, Mrs. Patterson suddenly deteriorates, bleeding from her sternum. Cristina and Nurse Tyler attempt to stabilize her as Dr. Burke rushes in. Meredith confesses to Dr. Burke that she may have nicked Mrs. Patterson’s heart during surgery. Burke is frustrated that Meredith did not speak up sooner, especially since she confessed in front of the patient’s husband. Cristina criticizes Meredith for her honesty, fearing it will get her kicked out of the program.

As the party at Meredith’s house grows out of control, Izzie tries to manage the chaos. Meredith returns home late from her failed attempt to get her mother’s papers signed, as her mother is confused and unable to consent. Dr. Webber, the chief of surgery, chastises Meredith for not handling her mother’s affairs sooner.

Back at the hospital, Jerry Frost, the drug-seeking patient, tries to avoid discharge, claiming pain. Izzie and Alex forcibly discharge him, but he falls and suffers a subdural bleed, requiring emergency brain surgery. Dr. Shepherd asks Izzie if she wants to assist, and she agrees, leaving the party behind.

At the party, Meredith is overwhelmed by the number of guests and the chaos. She tries to kick everyone out but is swept up in the revelry. Izzie’s boyfriend Hank arrives, surprised by the size of the party and frustrated that Izzie is absent. Izzie eventually finds Hank outside the hospital, and they argue about her priorities and the demands of her job. Hank leaves, disappointed.

Later, Meredith and Derek Shepherd share a quiet moment outside the party, joking about sneaking around and the party winding down. Cristina, Izzie, and George discuss Meredith’s impending meeting with the chief, worried about her future in the program.

The next day, Meredith meets with Dr. Bailey, Dr. Burke, and Dr. Webber to discuss Mrs. Patterson’s case. Meredith admits her mistake and presents her research, suggesting that Mrs. Patterson’s rapid weight loss may have weakened her heart muscle, making it susceptible to injury. Dr. Bailey criticizes Meredith for not reporting the incident immediately, but Dr. Burke defends her for eventually speaking up. Burke also confesses his own past mistake of leaving a towel in a patient and not reporting it out of fear for his career. He argues that doctors must be able to admit mistakes without fear of retribution.

Meredith is placed on one month’s probation but is not expelled from the program. Her friends are relieved, and Meredith acknowledges that Burke saved her. The episode ends with Meredith reflecting on the burdens and occasional perks of adulthood, as she and her friends resume their lives as surgical interns, facing the ongoing responsibilities of their chosen profession.
