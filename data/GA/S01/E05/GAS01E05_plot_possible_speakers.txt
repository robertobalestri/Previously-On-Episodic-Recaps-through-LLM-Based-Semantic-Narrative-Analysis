Meredith Grey reflects on the burdens of adulthood, contrasting it with the simpler worries of childhood. She laments the responsibilities that come with being an adult, especially as a surgical intern, and notes that holding a human heart in her hands is the ultimate responsibility.

Meredith is approached by a lawyer regarding her mother Ellis Grey’s advancing Alzheimer’s. The lawyer explains that Ellis needs to sign over her estate while she is still lucid. Meredith, exhausted and overwhelmed, questions why she must handle her mother’s affairs, but is told it is her responsibility.

At the hospital, Meredith participates in heart surgery under Dr. Burke’s supervision. During the procedure, she slips and apologizes, but is reassured by Dr. Burke. The surgery continues, and Meredith is instructed to gently release Mrs. Patterson’s heart from bypass. The team works to stabilize the patient, and Meredith muses on how such responsibility makes childhood worries seem trivial.

After the surgery, George O'Malley expresses envy at Meredith for getting to hold a heart. Cristina Yang jokes that even a monkey could do it, and the interns discuss an upcoming party at Meredith’s house. Izzie Stevens reveals she invited people from Pediatrics, which annoys Cristina, who wanted only "jocks" invited. Izzie promises to clear it with Meredith, but Meredith is unaware of the party and denies its existence when asked.

In the OR, Mrs. Patterson’s condition deteriorates. Dr. Burke and the team work to revive her, using compressions and a defibrillator. Cristina announces they have a rhythm, and the team closes up, with Dr. Burke commending their work. Meredith, in voiceover, reflects on the fear of letting responsibility slip through one’s fingers.

Later, George confides to Cristina that he may have damaged Mrs. Patterson’s heart during surgery by squeezing it when he nodded off and puncturing his glove. Cristina reassures him that the heart is tough and that Mrs. Patterson is fine.

Dr. Bailey quizzes George on Mrs. Drake’s case, who has hyperinflated lungs and diminished capacity. George recommends a bulectomy. Mrs. Drake describes her chronic back pain and allergies, and George suggests morphine, but Mrs. Drake insists only Demerol or Dilaudid will work. The attending physician suspects drug-seeking behavior but reminds the team to treat the pain as real and orders a central line.

Mrs. Drake discusses her history of quitting smoking and the pain that persisted, leading to her quitting her job. She feels no one believed her pain was real. George assures her it is not in her head. Mrs. Drake jokes with a young doctor about her age and asks if the surgery will work this time.

Elsewhere, Mr. Patterson is anxious about his wife’s recovery after heart surgery. The young doctor reassures him they are monitoring her closely. Mr. Sturman, another patient, jokes about never wanting a bowel obstruction again and reveals he dropped out of medical school. He tells the doctor that a physician’s first responsibility is always to the patient.

During Mrs. Drake’s surgery, Dr. Burke and Dr. Bailey discover a towel left inside her from a previous operation five years ago. Dr. Burke instructs Cristina to investigate who was responsible for the initial surgery, while George is told to keep Mrs. Drake comfortable.

Cristina and Izzie continue to plan the party, ordering microbrews and bar nuts. The party grows in size as more hospital staff are invited, much to Cristina’s annoyance. Izzie insists that doctors can have fun and are not all workaholics.

Meredith deals with the logistics of her mother’s legal paperwork, coordinating with the notary and care facility staff. She is frustrated by the timing and the pressure to handle everything. At the care facility, Ellis Grey is late and confused, and the staff informs Meredith that her mother is sundowning and cannot sign the papers. Meredith is criticized by a family member for not handling things sooner.

Back at the hospital, Jerry Frost, a patient suspected of drug-seeking, becomes agitated. Dr. Karev and Izzie attempt to discharge him, but Jerry resists, claiming he is still in pain. During the struggle, Jerry falls and sustains a head injury. Meredith and Izzie rush him to CT, where they discover a subdural bleed. Dr. Shepherd decides to operate immediately, and Izzie eagerly joins the brain surgery.

Meanwhile, the party at Meredith’s house spirals out of control. Hank, Izzie’s boyfriend, is overwhelmed by the number of guests and upset that the party was not as he expected. He argues with Izzie about her work commitments and the demands of her job. Izzie tries to reassure him, but Hank leaves, feeling neglected.

At the hospital, Alex Karev discusses Jerry Frost’s case with Izzie, revealing his own father’s history with addiction. The interns reflect on why they chose to become surgeons, acknowledging the seriousness of their work.

As the party continues, Meredith and Derek Shepherd share a private moment outside. They joke about the party and their lives, and Meredith admits her life feels like crap. Derek encourages her, and they sneak back inside together.

The next morning, Meredith prepares for a meeting with the chief and legal about Mrs. Patterson’s case. She fears she could be kicked out of the program for not reporting the glove puncture during surgery. Cristina and Izzie try to comfort her. In the meeting, Meredith presents her research, arguing that Mrs. Patterson’s rapid weight loss led to weakened heart walls, making a small poke catastrophic. Dr. Bailey supports this, but the hospital lawyer insists Meredith’s late reporting leaves the hospital liable. Dr. Burke defends Meredith, admitting his own past mistake of leaving a towel in a patient and arguing that doctors must be able to admit errors without fear of retribution. The chief places Meredith on one month’s probation.

After the meeting, Cristina tells Meredith that Burke saved her. Bailey shoos the interns away, and Cristina notes that Burke always intended to reveal the towel incident but waited for the right time.

Meredith reflects on the inescapability of responsibility in adulthood. She helps Jerry Frost connect with a rehab counselor and apologizes to Mrs. Drake for the towel incident. Jerry celebrates a small victory—he finally pooped.

Cristina and Meredith discuss missing the party and the realities of life as surgeons. Meredith concludes that, despite the burdens, adulthood has its perks, like shoes, sex, and freedom from parental control. The episode ends with Meredith and Cristina sharing coffee, acknowledging the challenges and small joys of their chosen path.
