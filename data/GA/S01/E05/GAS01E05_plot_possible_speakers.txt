Meredith Grey wakes up and reflects on how childhood worries were simple compared to the responsibilities of adulthood, which she finds overrated. She notes that being an adult means having responsibilities, such as earning a living, paying rent, and, as a surgical intern, holding a human heart in her hands.

Meredith is informed by a lawyer that her mother's Alzheimer's is advancing, and while Ellis Grey is still lucid, she needs to sign her estate over to Meredith. Meredith is overwhelmed, having not slept in 48 hours and facing her first heart surgery. She protests, asking if someone else can handle her mother's affairs, but is told it's her responsibility.

During heart surgery, Dr. Burke instructs Meredith to release Mrs. Patterson's heart gently. Meredith apologizes for her hands slipping. The surgery proceeds, and Burke tells the team to warm the patient up and get her off bypass. Meredith muses that such responsibility makes childhood worries seem appealing.

After the surgery, Izzie Stevens wishes she could hold a heart, while Cristina Yang jokes that even a monkey could do it. The interns discuss a party at Meredith's house, with Cristina and Izzie debating the guest list and whether Izzie's boyfriend Hank is bad in bed. Alex Karev and George O'Malley join the conversation, and Meredith is surprised to hear about the party, insisting she didn't know about it.

In the OR, Mrs. Patterson's heart struggles to restart. Burke leads the team through compressions and defibrillation, eventually restoring rhythm. Meredith worries she may have damaged the heart during surgery, confessing to George and Izzie that she nodded off and squeezed it, puncturing her glove. George reassures her that the patient is okay and advises her not to tell Burke, but Meredith remains anxious.

George is assigned to Mrs. Drake, a patient with chronic back pain and a history of lung surgery. He and Meredith assess her pain and medication needs, suspecting she may be addicted to Dilaudid. Dr. Bailey reminds them to treat her pain seriously. Mrs. Drake shares her struggles with quitting smoking and the disbelief she faced about her pain. George comforts her, confirming the pain is real.

Mr. Sturman, another patient, jokes about never wanting a bowel obstruction again and reveals he dropped out of medical school. He tells Meredith and George that a doctor's first responsibility is always to the patient.

During Mrs. Drake's lung surgery, Burke and Bailey discover a towel left inside her from a previous operation. Bailey instructs Cristina to investigate the initial surgery and who was responsible for closing. George is told to keep Mrs. Drake happy, as she likes him.

Bailey asks George if she's invited to the party, and he awkwardly confirms. Cristina and Izzie coordinate beer and snacks for the party, discussing the guest list and timing. Alex and Meredith joke about party invitations.

Mrs. Drake confronts George about the towel left inside her, learning it was Dr. Weber, the chief, who was responsible. Burke tells the team to keep the discovery quiet while they work it out.

Burke invites Cristina to dinner, suggesting they skip the party and spend time alone. Cristina declines, and Burke thanks her for not inviting him, encouraging her to think about dinner.

Suddenly, Mrs. Patterson develops swelling and bleeding over her sternum. Burke, Meredith, and Cristina scramble to stabilize her. Meredith confesses to Burke that she popped a glove and may have nicked the heart. Burke is frustrated that Meredith didn't speak up earlier and instructs her to apologize to the husband and review the case history. He warns her that her career is on the line.

Meredith worries she could be kicked out of the program. Cristina and Izzie debate whether Patterson will sue and criticize Meredith for telling Burke. Meredith prepares for a notary appointment regarding her mother's estate, with Bailey and Webber arranging for legal and medical witnesses.

At the party, Izzie and Cristina argue about the guest list and Izzie's relationship with Hank. Meredith arrives late to the notary meeting with Ellis Grey, who is confused and unable to sign the papers due to sundowning. The team realizes they should have scheduled the meeting earlier in the day.

Alex and Izzie deal with Jerry Frost, a patient with pain medication addiction. Alex tries to discharge him, but Jerry resists, demanding more drugs. After a struggle, Jerry falls and suffers a subdural bleed. Cristina and Alex rush him to CT, and Dr. Shepherd invites Izzie to assist in brain surgery.

At the party, Meredith is overwhelmed by the number of guests. She and Cristina try to manage the chaos, and Alex offers to kick everyone out. Meredith decides to let the party continue. Hank arrives, frustrated by the crowd and Meredith's absence. Meredith explains her commitment to her job and patients, and Hank feels neglected.

Later, Meredith and Derek Shepherd talk outside. Derek jokes about being blown off for tequila, and Meredith asks him to take her for a ride. They agree the party is winding down and share a moment before sneaking back inside.

The next morning, Meredith prepares for her meeting with the chief. Cristina apologizes for the party getting out of hand. Burke reviews Mrs. Patterson's case, questioning the cause of her heart wall tearing. Meredith explains that the patient's rapid weight loss led to muscle loss, including heart muscle, which made the heart vulnerable. The hospital administrator criticizes Meredith for not reporting the glove puncture immediately, exposing the hospital to liability.

Burke defends Meredith, sharing his own past mistake of leaving a towel in a patient and not reporting it due to fear of repercussions. He argues that doctors must be able to speak up about errors without fear. Meredith is placed on one month probation.

Cristina and Izzie support Meredith, noting that Burke saved her. Bailey urges everyone to get back to work. Cristina observes that Burke was always going to report the towel incident, emphasizing that information is power.

Jerry Frost is offered rehab options. Meredith apologizes to Mrs. Drake for the towel incident. Mr. Sturman celebrates passing gas, confirming his recovery.

The interns reflect on missing the party and the challenges of life as surgeons. Meredith concludes that while responsibility is difficult, adulthood has its perks, including freedom and independence.
