Meredith Grey wakes up in the shower and later visits her mother, Ellis Grey, at a nursing home to discuss her estate. She is exhausted from lack of sleep and preparing for heart surgery. In the operating room, she struggles to stay awake while holding a heart, leading to concerns about her performance. Meanwhile, her colleagues, including George O'Malley and Cristina Yang, discuss a party Izzie Stevens is planning, which is meant to be a small gathering but grows larger than expected.

During surgery, complications arise when a patient flatlines, but the team manages to revive her. Meredith worries she may have caused issues due to a punctured glove. As the day progresses, George O'Malley and Miranda Bailey work on a patient, Mrs. Drake, who has a towel left inside from a previous surgery, raising concerns about medical negligence.

Meredith faces scrutiny after a patient, Mrs. Patterson, experiences complications post-surgery, leading her to fear for her job. She confides in George, who reassures her, but the situation escalates when Mr. Patterson, Mrs. Patterson's husband, becomes angry over the complications. Meredith's stress is compounded by a party at her house, which she did not intend to be large.

After a night of drinking at the party, Meredith and Derek Shepherd share a romantic moment. The next day, Meredith prepares for a meeting regarding the surgery incident, where she takes responsibility for the events. Dr. Preston Burke supports her, sharing his own past mistakes, and ultimately, Meredith is not fired but will be monitored.

Ellis Grey signs the necessary documents for her estate, and various characters deal with their personal and professional challenges, including Izzie helping a patient with bowel issues and Cristina and Preston's romantic involvement. The episode concludes with the group cleaning up after the party, reflecting on the events that transpired.
