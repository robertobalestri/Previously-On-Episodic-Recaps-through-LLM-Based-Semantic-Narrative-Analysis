In the operating room, Burke is placing a stitch.
Meredith starts to nod off while holding the heart.
Burke notices and asks her about it.
Meredith apologizes, saying the heart slipped, but Burke is finished, and she can release Mrs. Patterson's heart.
As they prepare to take the patient off bypass, George and Cristina watch from the gallery.
George feels jealous that Meredith got to hold a heart.
Cristina believes a monkey could hold a heart.
George thinks she feels this way because Burke didn't ask her to assist.
Izzie enters looking for George, saying she needs more ice and chips.
George is surprised and asks how many people she invited.
Cristina reminds them the invite list was for 'jocks only,' meaning surgery, trauma, and plastics.
Izzie admits she also invited people from pediatrics, whom Cristina calls preschoolers.
Cristina jokes that shrinks are next, and when Izzie turns away, she realizes Izzie already invited them and says the party is already a failure.
George reminds Izzie that Meredith thinks it's a small, meet-your-boyfriend cocktail event, and asks if she got Meredith's approval.
Izzie admits she didn't but promises to do so.

Izzie denies this and says she just wants him to meet her friends.
Cristina is called away despite her doubts.
Alex arrives and inquires about a party at Meredith's house, taking Cristina's seat.
Cristina, George, and Izzie deny any party while Alex observes the surgery below.

She admits she nodded off and thinks she might have squeezed it.
George reassures her, saying the heart is a strong muscle.
Meredith mentions her fingernail popped a glove and worries she might have punctured the heart.
George explains that if she had punctured it, they would have noticed when they tried to reperfuse, but since the heart started again, the patient is fine.
Meredith considers telling Burke.
George questions what there is to tell since nothing happened and the patient is okay.
They both continue to reassure each other that the patient is fine.
Richard, Bailey, and George are looking at chest X-rays for Mrs. Drake.
Bailey asks George for his observations.
George notes the lungs are hyperinflated, cloudy with bullae, and have reduced capacity, suggesting breathing difficulties.
Bailey inquires about his next steps, and George mentions he would perform a bullectomy to relieve pressure.
Richard, holding the chart, mentions they operated on Mrs. Drake in 1999.
Despite her previous procedure, George needs to explain it to her again and avoid anti-smoking lectures, as she already feels guilty.
As George leaves, he asks Bailey if displaying lung scans on cigarette packs would deter smoking.
Meanwhile, Derek and Alex are with a patient who has back pain.
Alex asks how long the pain has persisted.
The patient describes it as chronic, meaning it is constant.
Alex acknowledges understanding "chronic" and requests more details about the pain type.
The patient describes his pain as feeling like a thousand swords stabbing his spine.
He mentions being allergic to aspirin and most NSAIDs.

Derek notices track marks on the patient's arm.
Outside the room, Alex thinks the patient is seeking drugs.
He believes the patient exaggerated the pain and calls him a junkie.
Derek asks Alex what he would do.
Alex suggests checking the patient's history in the database, referring him to a program, and discharging him.
Derek tells Alex he can do that after giving the patient something for the pain.
Alex is frustrated, saying that's what the patient wants.
Derek explains they must treat the pain as if it's real and that they should always be cautious in pain management.
He instructs Alex to start a central line, noting the patient's veins are damaged, and then Derek is paged away.
Mrs. Drake mentioned to George that her last surgery was meant to help, but it never felt right.
George suggested that quitting smoking might have been wise.
She retorted that she had a 4-pack-a-day habit, which was tough, but she did quit, and it didn’t help.
George was surprised and said they thought she was still smoking based on her scans.
She confirmed she quit cold turkey 5 years ago as they prepared her for surgery.
She shared that she had to leave her restaurant job because even sitting was painful, but no one believed her.
George assured her he saw the films and it wasn’t just in her head.
She asked him to come closer and remarked he seemed too young to be a doctor.
He replied that he was older than he looked.
She inquired if the procedure would work this time, and he said it was her best option.
She appreciated his honesty.
Meredith watches as Nurse Tyler helps Mrs. Patterson settle into the hospital bed.
Meredith then greets Mrs. Patterson’s husband and learns about her condition.
She assures him that her levels are good and explains that heart surgery is very taxing.
They are monitoring her closely, and she should recover well.
Izzie approaches Mr. Sterman and asks about his condition.
He says he feels okay but doesn’t want another bowel obstruction.
She jokes that many people request them and asks if he’s managing clear fluids and if he has used the bathroom.
He’s unsure, so she asks if he has passed gas.
He lies and says yes, but she knows he’s not telling the truth.
He apologizes and reveals he attended medical school but left during his final year of clinical training.
He worked too many hours and was going through a divorce.
Now, he does research and has a family.
He apologizes, saying he meant no offense.
Izzie assures him it's fine.
She believes it's possible to have both a successful career and a family.
He doubts it, thinking doctors must prioritize their patients.
As Izzie leaves Mr. Sterman's room, Burke approaches Cristina at the nurse's station and gives her a coffee.
She looks at him, confused, while he drinks his own coffee.
He tells her it's just coffee.
Cristina awkwardly accepts it, and they part ways.
As she turns the corner, Burke watches her with a smile.

She pretended to order office supplies but made the request and changed delivery from 5 to 7.
Mr. Sterman passed her and joked about being invited if he pooped.
Derek heard his pain patient complaining and struggling with a nurse as he walked by.
Mr.
Frost asks Derek where he has been.
Derek assures him they will help and goes to find Alex.
Derek criticizes Alex for not starting a central line as instructed.
Alex explains the patient has been in seven hospitals in four months and is an addict.
Derek points out the patient has a 3-lumbar fusion, but Alex only sees an addict.
Derek acknowledges the addiction but insists the pain is real.
He tells Alex to drop the attitude and start the central line.
George is with Mrs. Drake, who mentions a handsome, older surgeon told her about a towel left inside her.
George identifies the surgeon as Dr. Webber, their chief.
Mrs. Drake realizes the towel was left after her last surgery and questions how that could happen.
George agrees with her concern.
Cristina enters an office and searches through files for information on Mrs. Drake’s initial surgery.
She finds a post-op report naming Dr. John Davies as the surgeon and Dr. Preston Burke as the surgical fellow.
She takes this information to Bailey and asks what to do next.

Meredith is then paged.
She goes to Mrs. Patterson’s bed, where Nurse Tyler informs her there was swelling over the sternum, followed by heavy bleeding.
He had already contacted Burke.
Mr. Patterson wanted to know if his wife was dying.
Meredith asked someone to remove Mr. Patterson and apply pressure to the wound.
When Burke arrived, he instructed Tyler to arrange an OR and asked Meredith for an update.
She informed him that the patient had received medication without any allergic reactions and updated him on her lab results.
Burke was unsure about the issue and told the team to move.
Meredith hesitated but admitted she had torn a glove in the OR.
Mr. Patterson heard everything and watched as they took his wife to surgery.
In the OR, Burke criticized Meredith for not speaking up earlier.
She had chances to tell him before he closed, but instead, she confessed in front of the husband.
He says she isn't sure if it was her fault and keeps apologizing.
He finds the problem and calls her to the table.
There is a rupture in the wall, larger than a fingernail.
He explains that Mrs. Patterson's ventricular walls are weak.

Cristina is annoyed about the nurses being invited.
George asks if Izzie has Meredith's approval.
Izzie believes a few more people won't matter, saying a party is a party.
Cristina agrees, noting that a bigger party means less time for bad sex with her hockey player.
Izzie tells her to stop, insisting she and Hank have great sex often and might even during the party.
Cristina laughs, and George reminds her to check with Meredith.
Izzie mentions that Hank needs to see doctors can have fun and aren't just workaholics.
Cristina insists they are, which annoys Izzie.
George plays with an inflated glove.
Meredith is on the phone confirming a notary will arrive at 6:30, along with the home's doctor to verify her mother's mental competency.
She asks if she needs anything besides her license and checkbook, confirms the time again, and ends the call.
Derek approaches her, having overheard.
She assumes he's talking about her call and tries to cover, but he's referring to the heart issue and asks if she wants to discuss it.
She says they're adults but questions when that happened and how to stop it as she leaves.
Cristina puts a patient chart back on the rack while Burke is working at the nurse’s station.

George sarcastically reminds Meredith she was supposed to prepare for a meeting that could ruin her.
They discuss Mrs. Patterson.
Meredith says the heart shouldn't have torn because the lady lost 50 pounds and was in great shape.
Izzie thinks about whether losing 50 pounds in a year affected her muscle mass.
Meredith is at a meeting.
Meanwhile, George, Izzie, and Cristina are betting on the meeting's outcome.
Meredith talks to Webber and takes responsibility for the previous day's events.
She mentions that the patient's condition, who still weighs 100 pounds, is crucial.
The patient's muscle mass, including heart muscle, has reduced significantly due to weight loss.
Dr. Webber believes this explains the heart tearing after a minor impact.
The hospital lawyer points out that Meredith didn't report the minor impact quickly, risking hospital liability.
Dr. Burke defends Meredith and shares his experience with Mrs. Drake.
