Burke tells her she can release Mrs. Patterson's heart now.
As they prepare to take the patient off bypass, George and Cristina watch from the gallery.
George feels jealous because Meredith got to hold a heart.
Cristina believes a monkey could hold a heart.
George thinks she feels this way because Burke didn't ask her to assist.
Izzie enters looking for George, saying she needs more ice and chips.
George is surprised and asks how many people she invited.
Cristina repeats the invite list was for 'jocks only,' meaning surgery, trauma, and plastics.
Izzie mentions she invited some people from pediatrics too, whom Cristina calls preschoolers.
Cristina jokes that shrinks are next, and when Izzie turns away, she realizes Izzie already invited them and says the party is already dead on arrival.
George reminds Izzie that Meredith thinks it's a small, meet-your-boyfriend, cocktail event and asks if she checked with Meredith first.
Izzie admits she didn't but promises she will.

George questions what there is to tell since nothing happened and the patient is fine.
They both continue to reassure each other that the patient is okay.
Richard, Bailey, and George are looking at chest X-rays for Mrs. Drake.
Bailey asks George for his observations.
George notes that the lungs are hyperinflated, cloudy with bullae, and have reduced capacity.
He believes the patient is likely having breathing difficulties.
Bailey inquires about his next steps, and George suggests a bullectomy to relieve pressure.
Richard mentions they operated on Mrs. Drake in 1999.
Despite her previous surgery, George needs to explain the procedure to her and avoid anti-smoking lectures, as she already feels guilty.
As George leaves, he wonders if putting lung scans on cigarette packs would deter smoking.
Meanwhile, Derek and Alex are with a patient who has back pain.
Alex asks how long the pain has persisted.
The patient describes it as chronic, meaning it is constant.

Outside the room, Alex thinks the patient is seeking drugs.
He believes the patient exaggerated his pain and calls him a junkie.
Derek asks Alex what he would do.
Alex wants to check the patient's history, refer him to a program, and discharge him.
Derek agrees but insists Alex must first give the patient something for the pain.
Alex is frustrated, thinking that's what the patient wants.
Derek explains they must treat the pain as real and that the first rule of pain management is to be cautious.
He instructs Alex to start a central line, noting the patient's veins are damaged, and then Derek is paged away.
Mrs. Drake mentioned to George that her last surgery was meant to help, but it never felt right.
George suggested quitting smoking might have been wise.
She retorted that she had a 4-pack-a-day habit, quit, and it was very difficult, but it didn’t help.
George was surprised and said her scans made them think she still smoked.
She confirmed she quit cold turkey 5 years ago as they prepared her for surgery.
She shared that she had to leave her restaurant job because even sitting was painful, but no one believed her.

She asked him to come closer and remarked he seemed too young to be a doctor.
He replied he was older than he looked.
She inquired if the procedure would work this time, and he said it was her best option.
She appreciated his straightforwardness.
Meredith observes as Nurse Tyler helps Mrs. Patterson settle into the hospital bed.
Meredith then talks to Mrs. Patterson's husband to get an update on her condition.
She assures him that Mrs. Patterson's levels are stable and explains that heart surgery is very demanding.
They are keeping a close watch on her, and she should recover well.
Izzie closes the curtain and approaches Mr. Sterman, asking about his condition.
He replies that he feels okay but doesn't want another bowel obstruction.
She jokes that many people request them and checks if he's managing clear fluids and using the bathroom.
He hesitates, so she asks if he's passed gas.
He lies and says yes, but she knows he's not truthful.
He apologizes and reveals he attended medical school but left during his final year of clinical training.
He worked too many hours and was going through a divorce.
Now, he does research and has a family.
He apologizes, saying he meant no offense.
Izzie assures him it’s fine.
She believes one can have both a successful career and a family.
He doubts this, thinking a doctor's first responsibility is to their patient.
As Izzie leaves Mr. Sterman’s room, Burke approaches Cristina at the nurse’s station and gives her a coffee.
She looks at him, confused, while he sips his own.
He explains it’s just coffee.

Mr.
Frost asks Derek where he has been.

Derek criticizes Alex for not starting a central line as instructed.
Alex explains the patient has been in seven hospitals in four months and is an addict.
Derek points out the patient has a 3-lumbar fusion, but Alex only sees an addict.
Derek acknowledges the addiction but insists the pain is real.
He tells Alex to drop the attitude and start the central line.
George is with Mrs. Drake, who mentions a handsome, older surgeon told her about a towel left inside her.

Mrs. Drake realizes the towel was left after her last surgery and questions how that could happen.
George agrees with her concern.
Cristina enters an office and searches through files for information on Mrs. Drake’s initial surgery.

Meredith is then paged and goes to Mrs. Patterson’s bed.
Nurse Tyler informs her there was swelling over the sternum, followed by heavy bleeding.
He had already contacted Burke.
Mr. Patterson wanted to know if his wife was dying.
Meredith asked someone to remove Mr. Patterson and apply pressure to the wound.
When Burke arrived, he instructed Tyler to call for an operating room and asked Meredith for an update.
She informed him that the patient had received medication without any allergic reactions and updated him on her lab results.
Burke was unsure what went wrong and told the team to move.
Meredith hesitated but admitted she had torn a glove in the operating room.
Mr. Patterson heard everything and watched as they moved his wife to surgery.

There is a rupture in the wall, larger than a fingernail.
He explains that Mrs. Patterson's ventricular walls are weak.

Izzie insists a few more people won't matter, saying a party is a party.
Cristina agrees, adding that a bigger party means less time for bad sex with her hockey player.
Izzie tells her to stop, claiming she and Hank have great sex frequently and might even have sex during the party.
Cristina laughs, and George reminds her to check with Meredith.
Izzie mentions that Hank needs to see doctors can have fun and aren't just workaholics.
Cristina disagrees, which annoys Izzie, while George plays with a glove.
Meredith is on the phone, confirming a notary will arrive at 6:30, along with a doctor to verify her mother's mental state.
She asks if she needs anything besides her license and checkbook, confirms the time again, and ends the call.

Meredith mentions the heart shouldn't have torn, noting the lady lost 50 pounds and was in great shape.
Izzie thinks about whether losing 50 pounds in a year affected her muscle mass.
Meredith attends a meeting while George, Izzie, and Cristina bet on the discussion's outcome.
Meredith talks to Webber, taking responsibility for the previous day's events.
She mentions the patient's condition, who still weighs 100 pounds, as a key factor.
The patient's muscle mass, including the heart, has reduced due to weight loss.
Dr. Webber believes this explains the heart tearing after a minor impact.
The hospital lawyer points out that Meredith didn't report the impact quickly, risking hospital liability.
