Meredith is sleeping in the shower while holding a toothbrush.
She wakes up when her arm slips off her knee.
She finishes her shower.
Meredith goes to the nursing home where her mother lives.
She talks to a staff member about having her mother sign over her estate while her mother is still clear-minded.
Meredith watches her mother through the glass.
She explains she has not slept for 48 hours.
She says she has her first chance at heart surgery that morning and is missing rounds.
She asks if someone else can handle the paperwork instead.

Meredith apologizes and says the heart slipped.
Burke tells her he is finished and she can let go of Mrs. Patterson’s heart.
They prepare to take the patient off bypass.
George and Cristina are watching from the gallery.
George feels jealous that Meredith got to hold a heart.
Cristina says anyone could do it, even a monkey.
George thinks Cristina is upset because Burke did not ask her to assist.
Izzie comes in looking for George.
She tells him she needs more ice and chips.
George is surprised and asks how many people she invited.
Cristina says the party was supposed to be for surgery, trauma, and plastics doctors only.
Izzie says she also invited people from pediatrics.
Cristina calls them preschoolers.
Cristina guesses that Izzie also invited psychiatrists.
Izzie turns away, and Cristina realizes she did.
Cristina says the party is already a failure.
George reminds Izzie that Meredith thinks the party is a small cocktail event to meet Izzie’s boyfriend.
He asks if Izzie told Meredith about the bigger party.
Izzie says she has not but promises she will.
Cristina asks why Izzie is using the only weekend her boyfriend is in town for a party.
Cristina suggests it is because he is bad in bed.
Izzie denies this and says she just wants him to meet her friends.
Cristina does not believe her but leaves when she is paged.
Alex enters and asks about the party at Meredith’s house.
He takes Cristina’s seat.
Cristina, George, and Izzie all deny there is a party.
Alex watches the surgery below.
In the operating room, an alarm goes off.
The team is not sure what is wrong.
The anesthesiologist tells Burke that the patient’s temperature is rising.
They continue to massage the heart.
Burke says the heart should be beating on its own by now.
The patient’s heart stops.
The team continues chest compressions.
Burke calls for paddles and shocks the patient twice.
The patient’s heartbeat returns.

She worries she may have caused a problem.
Derek is eating as he walks up to Meredith.
He asks her how the surgery went.
Meredith becomes less enthusiastic when George joins her and Derek.
Derek notices Meredith's change in attitude.
When the elevator arrives, George and Meredith get on, leaving Derek behind.
Inside the elevator, Meredith tells George she is worried she may have damaged the patient's heart while holding it.
She admits she briefly fell asleep and thinks she might have squeezed the heart.
George reassures her, saying the heart is a strong muscle.
Meredith then tells him her fingernail tore her glove.
She worries she might have punctured the patient's heart.
George explains that if she had punctured the heart, they would have noticed when they tried to restart it, but the heart started working again, so the patient is fine.
Meredith wonders if she should tell Dr. Burke about her mistake.
George tells her there is nothing to report since nothing happened and the patient is okay.
They both continue to reassure each other that the patient is fine.
Later, Richard, Bailey, and George review chest x-rays for Mrs. Drake.
Bailey asks George what he observes.
George points out that the lungs are hyperinflated, cloudy with bullae, and have very poor capacity.
He says the patient must be having trouble breathing.
Bailey asks what treatment he would choose.
George says he would perform a bullectomy to reduce the pressure.
Richard mentions that Mrs. Drake had this surgery in 1999.
He tells George that even though she has had the procedure before, George still needs to explain it to her and avoid lecturing her about smoking, since Mrs. Drake already feels bad.
As George leaves, he asks Bailey if putting this lung scan on cigarette packs would make people stop smoking.
Meanwhile, Derek and Alex see a patient who complains of back pain.
Alex asks how long the pain has lasted.
The patient says the pain is chronic, meaning it always hurts.
Alex says he understands the term and asks for a more specific description.
The patient compares the pain to being stabbed by a thousand swords and says he is allergic to aspirin and most NSAIDs.
Alex suggests using morphine, but the patient says only Demerol or Dilaudid help.
Derek notices track marks on the patient's arm.
After leaving the room, Alex tells Derek he thinks the patient is exaggerating and seeking drugs, calling him a junkie.
Derek asks Alex what he would do.
Alex says he would check the patient's history, refer him to a program, and discharge him.
Derek tells Alex he can do that, but only after giving the patient some medication.
Alex is frustrated and says that is what the patient wants.
Derek explains that they must treat the pain as real and that the first rule in pain management is to be cautious.
He instructs Alex to start a central line because the patient's veins are damaged, then Derek leaves when he is paged.
Mrs. Drake tells George that her last surgery was meant to help her, but it never felt right to her.
George suggests that quitting smoking might have helped.
Mrs. Drake responds sharply, saying she used to smoke four packs a day, quitting was extremely difficult, but she did quit, and it did not help her condition.
George is surprised because her scans made the doctors think she was still smoking.
Mrs. Drake insists she quit smoking suddenly five years ago.
The staff begins to move and prepare her for surgery.
Mrs. Drake explains she had to leave her job at the restaurant because even sitting was painful, but nobody believed her pain.
George reassures her that he has seen her medical images and knows her pain is real.
Mrs. Drake asks George to come closer and tells him he looks too young to be a doctor.
George replies that he is older than he appears.
Mrs. Drake asks if he thinks the upcoming procedure will work.
George tells her it is her best option.
Mrs. Drake says she appreciates his honesty.
Meredith stands at a distance and watches as Nurse Tyler helps Mrs. Patterson get comfortable in her hospital bed.
Meredith approaches and greets Mrs. Patterson’s husband.
She asks about Mrs. Patterson’s condition and confirms that her levels are stable.
Meredith explains that heart surgery is very demanding, but they are monitoring Mrs. Patterson closely and expect her to recover well.
Izzie closes the curtain as she approaches Mr. Sterman.
She asks how he is feeling.
Mr. Sterman says he feels okay but does not want to experience a bowel obstruction again.
Izzie jokes that many patients request bowel obstructions, then asks if he is tolerating clear fluids and if he has used the bathroom.
Mr. Sterman is unsure, so Izzie asks if he has passed gas.
Mr. Sterman says yes, but Izzie realizes he is lying.
Mr. Sterman apologizes and explains he attended medical school but dropped out during his last year of clinical training because of long hours and a divorce.
He now works in research and has a family.
He apologizes again and says he did not mean to offend her.
Izzie tells him it is fine and says she believes it is possible to have both a successful career and a family.
Mr. Sterman is doubtful, saying a doctor’s first responsibility is always to their patients.
As Izzie leaves Mr. Sterman’s room, Burke approaches Cristina at the nurse’s station and gives her a coffee.
Cristina looks confused as Burke drinks his own coffee.
Burke tells her it is just coffee.
Cristina awkwardly accepts the coffee, and they go in different directions.
As Cristina turns the corner, Burke looks back at her and smiles.
Meredith is in the locker room washing her face.
Richard is operating on Mrs. Drake using a technique called the ‘spaghetti procedure’.
Bailey is explaining this procedure to George during the surgery.
Bailey notices something strange in the surgical area and is surprised.
Richard decides they need to switch to an open surgery and tells the team to remove the scopes.
Richard makes a new incision while Bailey helps him.
Richard finds and removes a towel from inside Mrs. Drake.
George is confused about how the towel got there.
Richard thinks it was left during a surgery Mrs. Drake had five years ago.
Bailey comments that something careless has happened and keeps assisting.
After the surgery, Cristina joins Richard, Bailey, and George outside the operating room.
Cristina is surprised to hear that a towel was found inside a patient.
George explains that Mrs. Drake had complained about chest pressure, but no one believed her.
Richard says that this situation is bad for the patient, bad for the hospital, and just bad overall, then leaves.
Bailey tells Cristina to look through the files and find all information about Mrs. Drake’s earlier surgery, including who was present and who closed the incision.
Bailey tells George to stay with Mrs. Drake because she seems comfortable with him.
George asks how long he needs to stay, since his shift ends at 6pm.
Bailey knows about a party and asks if she is invited.
George says she is.
After Bailey leaves, Cristina looks annoyed at George, but George is unsure what else he could have said.
Izzie is on the phone ordering beer for the party.
Alex approaches and asks her to order local microbrews and bar nuts.
Izzie pretends she is ordering office supplies but adds Alex’s request and changes the delivery time from 5pm to 7pm.
Mr. Sterman walks by and jokes that if he poops, she should invite him to the party.
Derek is walking down the hall and hears his patient, Mr.
Frost, complaining and struggling with a nurse.
Mr.
Frost asks Derek where he has been.
Derek reassures him that they will help and goes to find Alex.
Derek scolds Alex for not starting a central line as instructed.
Alex says the patient has been in seven hospitals in four months and believes he is an addict.
Derek explains that the patient has had a three-level lumbar fusion and insists that, even if he is an addict, his pain is real.
Derek tells Alex to stop judging, go to the patient, and start the central line.
George is with Mrs. Drake.
Mrs. Drake says a handsome, older male surgeon told her she had a towel inside her.
George tells her that was Dr. Webber, the chief of surgery.
Mrs. Drake realizes the towel was left after her last surgery and asks who could have done that, saying it doesn’t seem right.
George agrees with her.
Cristina goes into an office and starts searching through files to find information about Mrs. Drake’s first surgery.
She finds a post-operation report.
The report says Dr. John Davies was the surgeon.
It also lists Dr. Preston Burke as the surgical fellow.
She takes this information to Bailey.
She asks Bailey what will happen next.
Bailey tells her to keep the information private while they figure things out.
Meredith is at the nurse’s station, working on charts.
Derek comes over to her.
He notices something is wrong and asks if she is okay.
Meredith tells him she is just tired from a long surgery.
Derek asks her to have dinner with him that night.
Meredith says she cannot go.
Derek tells her to forget about the party.
Meredith is surprised because she never mentioned the party to him.
Derek sarcastically thanks her for not inviting him and says it felt good.
He tells her to think about dinner as he leaves.
Meredith is then paged.
Meredith goes to Mrs. Patterson’s bed.
Nurse Tyler tells her there was swelling over Mrs. Patterson’s sternum, then blood started pouring out.
Tyler has already called Burke.
Mr. Patterson asks if his wife is dying.
Meredith asks someone to take Mr. Patterson out of the room and to hold pressure on the wound.
Burke arrives and tells Tyler to call for an operating room.
He asks Meredith for an update.
Meredith tells him the patient has received medication and has not had any allergic or other bad reactions.
She also gives him the latest lab results.
Burke does not know what went wrong and tells the team to move quickly.
Meredith hesitates, then admits she broke a glove in the operating room.
Mr. Patterson hears this as they take his wife to surgery.
In the operating room, Burke scolds Meredith for not telling him sooner.
He says she had many chances to speak up before he finished the surgery.
He also says she should not have confessed in front of the husband.
Burke tells her she does not know if it was her fault.
Meredith keeps apologizing.
Burke finds the problem and calls her over to the table.
He shows her a wall rupture that is much bigger than a fingernail.
He explains that Mrs. Patterson’s heart walls are weak.
Richard comes in from the scrub room.
He says he just spoke with Mr. Patterson.
He wants copies of Mrs. Patterson’s chart in his office by 5pm.
He says Burke and Meredith will meet with the legal team tomorrow and must be ready to explain what happened.
As he leaves, Richard complains about people making mistakes in surgery.
Burke tells Meredith he will go talk to Mr. Patterson.
He tells her to review the patient’s history and apologize a lot.
He warns her that her job is at risk.
Meredith reviews the chart with Cristina and George.
She told the group she had to meet with the chief the next morning.
She said she might be expelled from the program.
George believed she would not be expelled.
Cristina thought the husband would sue.
Cristina questioned why Meredith had told Burke about the situation.
George explained that he had advised Meredith not to tell Burke.
Meredith’s phone rang.
She said she needed to answer it and sarcastically thanked them for their support.
Izzie arrived with coffee, a banana, and chips.
She announced that beer would arrive at 7pm and that some floor nurses would bring wine.
Cristina was annoyed that Izzie had invited nurses.
George asked Izzie again if she had checked with Meredith about the party.
Izzie replied that a few more people would not matter and that a party is a party.
Cristina agreed and added that a bigger party meant less time for bad sex with her hockey player.
Izzie told Cristina to stop, insisting that she and Hank had great sex, often, and that they might even have sex during the party.
Cristina laughed.
George reminded Izzie again to clear the party with Meredith.
Izzie said Hank needed to see that doctors could have fun and were not just workaholics with god complexes.
Cristina replied that doctors were exactly that, which annoyed Izzie.
George played with an inflated glove.
Meredith was on the phone.
She confirmed that the notary could come at 6:30 and that the home's doctor would be present to confirm her mother's mental competency.
She asked if she needed to bring anything besides her license and checkbook.
She confirmed the time again and ended the call.
Derek joined her.
He said he had heard.
Meredith thought he meant her phone call and tried to cover, but Derek was talking about the heart issue.
He asked if she wanted to discuss it.
Meredith said they were adults but wondered when that happened and how to make it stop as she walked away.
Cristina returned a patient chart to the rack while Burke was charting at the nurse’s station.
They greeted each other awkwardly.
Cristina mentioned the complication with the heart graft.
Burke said he could handle it.
Cristina walked away but was not convinced.
Mr. Patterson was on the phone outside the hospital.
He ended the call quickly when Meredith approached.
He told her he had been speaking with his lawyer, who advised him not to talk to her.
Meredith said she understood he was frustrated and angry.
She asked for information about his wife.
Meredith explained that his wife’s heart walls were abnormally thin, which made Mr. Patterson angrier.
He told Meredith not to blame his wife.
He said he had heard what happened directly from his wife.
He insisted his wife was in the best shape of her life and told Meredith to ask his wife’s cardiologist.
He said his wife had just lost 100 pounds and told Meredith not to blame her.
Meredith tries to talk again, but the man tells her he is finished talking and leaves.
Alex and Derek are in Jerry Frost's hospital room.
They tell Jerry that they know he is only there to get drugs because of his addiction.

Izzie is in Mr. Sterman's room when Derek asks her to discharge Jerry, the patient with the drug problem.
In the hallway, Izzie and George discuss getting beers for a party.

Izzie says she wants to tell Meredith, but Cristina warns her that Meredith has already left.
George asks Izzie to tell Meredith that he is not responsible for the party.
Meredith goes to the notary.
Her mother, who is having an Alzheimer's episode, refuses to sign the house documents.
Meredith begs her mother to focus and sign the papers.
The notary's secretary tells Meredith that they cannot complete the deal that day and asks her to return the next day when her mother is lucid.
Meredith becomes impatient and leaves angrily.
Cristina sees Bailey and Burke talking.
Cristina realizes that Bailey is giving Burke the files about the surgery where he left a sponge inside Mrs. Drake.
Burke looks at the files and appears worried.
Meredith arrives home and finds out that a party is happening at her house.
At the party, Cristina asks Bailey if there are any updates about Mrs. Drake's case.
Bailey tells Cristina not to get involved.
At the hospital, Izzie and Alex, along with a nurse, are escorting Jerry Frost.
Jerry reacts violently.
Some nurses try to restrain him, but Jerry gets up, runs away, falls, hits his head, and loses consciousness.
Derek looks at Jerry's CT scan results.
He asks Izzie and Alex what they see in the images.
They notice a subdural hemorrhage.
Derek says they need to operate immediately.
Derek asks Izzie if she was supposed to leave or if she wants to stay for the surgery.
Izzie says she wants to stay.
At the party, Meredith finds George and asks where Izzie is.

Meredith says she cannot handle the situation.
George offers to send everyone home.
Cristina, who is drunk, greets Meredith.
Meredith begins drinking and dancing with Cristina at the party.

Hank waits outside the hospital for Izzie.
When she arrives, they greet each other with a kiss.
Izzie starts telling Hank about the surgery.
Hank says he did not want a big party and does not want to meet her coworkers.
Izzie reminds him that when she was a model, he did not mind meeting her colleagues.
Hank replies that at least she attended her parties back then.
Izzie insists that her life is different now and that her patients are her priority.
They argue because Hank traveled a long way to see her, but she chose work over him.
Izzie invites Hank to the party, but he refuses and leaves.
Later, Meredith is outside the house, drunk.
She sees Derek waiting for her by a car.
They flirt and talk about tequila.
They kiss and have sex in the car.
Miranda Bailey sees them from outside the car.
The next morning, the house is very messy.
George brings Meredith a cup and reminds her that she has to meet with the chief in an hour.
Izzie enters and asks about the mess.
Meredith, feeling down, jokes that Izzie should not talk to her anymore, but says it does not matter because she had nothing else to do.
George sarcastically reminds Meredith that she was supposed to prepare for a meeting that could ruin her career.
They begin discussing Mrs. Patterson.
Meredith says the heart should not have torn, and that the patient had lost 50 pounds and was in good health.
Izzie thinks about whether losing 50 pounds in one year could have reduced muscle mass.
Meredith attends a meeting.
At the same time, George, Izzie, and Cristina make bets about the meeting's result.
Meredith speaks with Dr. Webber and admits her responsibility for the previous day's events.
She also explains that the patient's current weight of 100 pounds is important because the patient's muscle mass, including the heart, has decreased a lot due to the rapid weight loss.
Dr. Webber believes this explains why the patient's heart tore after a small impact.
The hospital lawyer points out that Meredith did not report the minor impact quickly, which puts the hospital at risk for legal problems.
Dr. Burke supports Meredith and tells a story about Mrs. Drake.
He remembers that five years ago, when he was a resident, he did not report leaving a sponge inside Mrs. Drake because he was afraid of a meeting that could have ended his career.
Burke says that even skilled doctors make mistakes and should be able to admit them without fear.
Meredith tells her friends that she was not fired and will be watched for a month.
Miranda tells Cristina that Burke had already planned to reveal the truth about Mrs. Drake's case and was only waiting for the right time because he believes information gives power.
Ellis Grey signs some papers in front of Meredith.
Alex arranges for Jerry, who is recovering in bed after surgery, to meet a psychologist for help with addiction.
