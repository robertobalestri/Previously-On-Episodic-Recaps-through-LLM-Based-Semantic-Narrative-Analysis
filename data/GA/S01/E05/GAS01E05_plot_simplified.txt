Meredith is sleeping in the shower while holding a toothbrush.
She wakes up when her arm slips from her knee and continues her shower.
Later, Meredith goes to the nursing home where her mother lives.
She talks about having her mother sign over her estate while she is still clear-minded.
She watches her mother through the glass and mentions that she hasn’t slept in 48 hours.
Meredith explains that she is missing rounds because she is scheduled for heart surgery that morning.
She asks if there is anyone else who can handle the situation.
The nursing home representative tells her they are discussing her mother’s estate, finances, and medical care.
The representative asks if Meredith really wants to leave her mother’s care to someone else.
In the operating room, Burke is placing a stitch.
Meredith starts to nod off while holding the heart.
Burke sees her jerk awake and asks about it.
Meredith apologizes and says the heart slipped.
She adds that Burke is finished, so she can release Mrs. Patterson’s heart now.
As they prepare to take the patient off bypass, George and Cristina watch from the gallery.
George feels jealous that Meredith got to hold a heart.
Cristina believes a monkey could hold a heart.
George thinks she feels this way because she is upset that Burke didn’t ask her to help.
Izzie enters looking for George.
She tells him she needs more ice and chips.
George is surprised and asks how many people she invited.
Cristina reminds them that the invite list was only for surgery, trauma, and plastics.
Izzie mentions she invited some people from pediatrics, which Cristina refers to as preschoolers.
Cristina thinks therapists will be next.
When Izzie turns away, she realizes she already invited them and says the party is already dead.
George reminds Izzie that Meredith thinks this is a small cocktail gathering to meet boyfriends.
He asks if she cleared it with Meredith first.
Izzie admits she didn’t but promises to do so.
Cristina questions why Izzie is using the weekend with her boyfriend for a party.
She assumes it’s because he is not good in bed.
Izzie denies this and says she just wants him to meet her friends.
Cristina is unsure but is called away.
Alex enters and asks about a party at Meredith's house.
He takes Cristina's seat.
Cristina, George, and Izzie all say there is no party while Alex watches the surgery below.
In the operating room, an alarm sounds, but the team is unsure of the issue.
The anesthesiologist informs Burke that the patient's temperature is rising as they massage the heart.
Burke comments that the patient should be able to do that on her own by now.
Suddenly, the patient flatlines.
They continue chest compressions while Burke requests paddles and shocks the patient twice before restoring a heartbeat.
Burke praises the team and leaves to scrub out.
As Meredith turns away from the table, she sees that her fingernail has punctured her glove and worries she may have caused a problem.
Derek approaches Meredith while eating and asks how the surgery went.
She feels less excited when George arrives.
Derek sees her change in mood.
When the elevator comes, George and Meredith get in, leaving Derek behind.
Meredith tells George she might have accidentally harmed the heart while holding it.
She fell asleep briefly and thinks she may have squeezed it too hard.
George brushes off her concern, saying the heart is strong.
Meredith mentions that her fingernail broke a glove.
She worries that she might have punctured the patient’s heart.
George reassures her that if she had, they would have noticed when they tried to restore blood flow.
Since they got the patient’s heart started again, everything is fine.
Meredith questions whether she should inform Burke.
George insists there’s nothing to report because nothing went wrong and the patient is okay.
They both reassure each other that the patient is fine.
Richard, Bailey, and George are looking at chest films for Mrs. Drake.
Bailey asks George what he notices.
He sees hyperinflated lungs that are cloudy and have bullae.
He notes that the patient likely has trouble breathing.
Bailey then asks what he would do next.
George replies that he would perform a bullectomy to relieve the pressure.
Richard checks the chart and mentions that they operated on Mrs. Drake in 1999.
Even though she has had this procedure before, George still needs to explain it to her and avoid anti-smoking talks, as Mrs. Drake already feels bad.
As George leaves, he asks Bailey if putting the lung scan on cigarette packs would make people stop smoking.
Meanwhile, Derek and Alex are with a patient who has back pain.
Alex asks how long he has been in pain.
The patient explains that it is chronic, meaning it hurts all the time.
Alex acknowledges that he understands what chronic means and asks the patient to describe the type of pain he feels.
The patient describes his pain as if a thousand samurai are stabbing him in the spine.
He mentions he is allergic to aspirin and most NSAIDs.
Alex suggests using morphine, but the patient insists that only Demerol or dilaudid helps.
Derek notices track marks on the man's arm.
They leave the room, and Alex thinks the patient is just seeking drugs.
He believes the patient has exaggerated his pain and calls him a junkie.
Derek asks Alex what he would do in this situation.
Alex wants to check the patient's history in the database, refer him to a program, and then discharge him.
Derek agrees to check the history but insists on giving the patient something first.
Alex feels annoyed, thinking this is what the patient wants.
Derek argues that they must treat the pain as if it is real.
He states that the first rule of pain management is to be cautious.
He instructs Alex to start a central line, noting that the patient’s veins are in poor condition, and then he is paged away.
Mrs. Drake tells George that her last surgery was meant to help her, but it never felt right.
George suggests that quitting smoking might have been a good idea.
She responds that she used to smoke four packs a day, which was very difficult, but she quit and it didn’t help at all.
This surprises George, who thought she was still smoking based on her scans.
She confirms that she quit cold-turkey five years ago as they prepare her for surgery.
She explains that she had to leave her job at the restaurant because even sitting hurt, but no one believed her.
George reassures her that he saw the films, and it’s not just in her head.
She asks him to come closer and comments that he looks too young to be a doctor.
He insists he is older than he appears.
She inquires if he thinks the procedure will work this time, and he tells her it’s her best option.
She appreciates his honesty.

She explains that heart surgery is very taxing on patients and that they are monitoring her closely.
She believes Mrs. Patterson will be okay.
Izzie pulls the curtain aside as she walks over to Mr. Sterman.
She asks him how he is feeling today.
He replies that he feels mostly fine but hopes to avoid another bowel obstruction.
Izzie jokes about how many people request bowel obstructions and checks if he is managing to keep down clear fluids.
She also asks if he has used the bathroom yet.
He is uncertain, but she suggests he would likely know if he had.
She then inquires if he has passed gas.
He says yes, but Izzie suspects he is not telling the truth.
He admits he lied and shares that he attended medical school but dropped out during his last year of clinical training.
He had been working too many hours and was going through a divorce.
Now, he does research and has a life and family.
He apologizes for any offense, but Izzie reassures him it’s fine.
Izzie believes it is possible to have both a successful career and a family.
He is uncertain, thinking a doctor's main duty is to their patients.
As Izzie leaves Mr. Sterman’s room, Burke approaches Cristina at the nurse’s station.
He hands her a coffee while sipping his own.
Cristina looks up at him, confused.
He tells her it’s just coffee.
She awkwardly takes the coffee, and they part ways.
After she turns the corner, Burke looks back at her with a smile.
Meredith is washing her face in the locker room.
Richard is doing a procedure on Mrs. Drake while Bailey explains it to George.
They see something strange in the field, which surprises Bailey.
Richard decides to switch to an open procedure and removes the scopes.
He makes an incision while Bailey helps him.
Richard then pulls a towel out from inside Mrs. Drake.
George asks where the towel came from, and Richard guesses it might be from her surgery five years ago.
Bailey warns that something careless is happening and continues to assist.
Cristina joins Richard, Bailey, and George outside the operating room.
She is surprised that they found a towel in a patient.

George confirms that she is.
After Bailey leaves, Cristina looks at George with irritation.
George is confused about what he should have said.

Mr. Sterman walks by and jokingly asks if he will be invited to the party if he poops.
Derek hears a pain patient complaining and struggling with a nurse as he walks by.
Mr.
Frost asks Derek where he has been.
Derek assures him they will help and goes to find Alex.

Derek acknowledges the patient’s addiction but insists that his pain is real.
He tells Alex to stop being disrespectful and to start the central line.
George is with Mrs. Drake.
She mentions that a handsome, older male surgeon told her she had a towel inside her.
George informs her that the surgeon is Dr. Webber, their chief.
Mrs. Drake realizes the towel was left inside after her last surgery and questions how that could happen.
George agrees that it doesn’t seem right.
Cristina enters an office and begins searching through files for information about Mrs. Drake’s initial surgery.
She finds a post-operative report.
It lists Dr. John Davies as the surgeon and Dr. Preston Burke as the surgical fellow.
She takes this information to Bailey and asks what will happen next.
Bailey tells her to keep it private while they sort it out.
Meredith is at the nurse’s station when Derek approaches her.
He notices she seems off and asks if she is okay.

He sarcastically thanks her for not inviting him, saying it felt good.
He tells her to think about dinner as he leaves, and she receives a page.

When Burke arrives, he instructs Tyler to call for an operating room and asks Meredith for an update.
She informs him that the patient has received medication without any allergic reactions and shares her lab results.
Burke is confused about what went wrong and tells the team to act quickly.
Meredith hesitates but admits that she accidentally popped a glove in the operating room.
Mr. Patterson overhears this and watches as they take his wife to surgery.
In the operating room, Burke scolds Meredith for not speaking up earlier.
He points out that she had many chances to inform him before he closed and that she confessed in front of the husband.
He mentions that she is unsure if she is to blame, and she keeps apologizing.
He then identifies the issue and signals for her to join him at the table.
There is a significant rupture in the wall, much larger than a fingernail.
He informs her that Mrs. Patterson has weak ventricular walls just as Richard enters from the scrub room.
Richard says he spoke with Mr. Patterson and needs copies of his wife's chart in his office by 5 PM.
He adds that Burke and Meredith will meet with legal tomorrow and must explain what happened.

She mentions that beer will arrive at 7 PM and some floor nurses are bringing wine.
Cristina is upset that Izzie invited nurses.
George asks if Izzie checked with Meredith.
Izzie argues that a few more guests won't matter; a party is a party.
Cristina agrees but adds that a bigger party means less time for her bad sex with her hockey player.
Izzie tells her to stop, claiming she and Hank have great sex often.
She suggests they might even have sex after or during the party.
Cristina laughs.
George reminds her to check with Meredith.
Izzie says Hank needs to understand that doctors can have fun and are not just workaholics.
Cristina disagrees, saying that is exactly what they are, which annoys Izzie.
Meanwhile, George plays with an inflated glove.
Meredith is on the phone.
She confirms that the notary will arrive at 6:30.

Meredith is at a meeting.
Meanwhile, George, Izzie, and Cristina are betting on the meeting's outcome.
During her talk with Dr. Webber, Meredith takes responsibility for the previous day's events.
She mentions that the patient's weight of 100 pounds is important.
The patient’s muscle mass, including her heart muscle, has greatly decreased due to extreme weight loss.
Dr. Webber believes this explains the heart tearing from a minor impact.
The hospital lawyer points out that Meredith did not report the minor impact quickly, which puts the hospital at risk.
Dr. Burke supports Meredith and shares his experience with a patient named Mrs. Drake.
