1
00:00:04,163 --> 00:00:08,148
Remember when you were a kid,
and your biggest worry was,

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,939
like, if you'd get a bike for your birthday

3
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:13,729
or if you'd get to eat cookies for breakfast?

4
00:00:14,563 --> 00:00:17,670
Being an adult - totally overrated.

5
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:23,944
I mean, seriously, don't be fooled by
all the hot shoes and the great sex

6
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:26,477
and the no parents anywhere
telling you what to do.

7
00:00:28,121 --> 00:00:30,506
Adulthood is responsibility.

8
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:33,636
The lawyer has been managing her estate
with a limited power of attorney,

9
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:35,831
but your mother's alzheimer's is advancing.

10
00:00:35,883 --> 00:00:37,992
So, while she's still lucid enough to consent,

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,988
she needs to sign everything over to you.

12
00:00:42,068 --> 00:00:42,882
Me?

13
00:00:46,077 --> 00:00:49,231
Responsibility - it really does suck.

14
00:00:49,303 --> 00:00:52,022
Look, I haven't slept in 48 hours.

15
00:00:52,099 --> 00:00:54,977
I'm getting my first shot at
heart surgery this morning.

16
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:56,430
I'm missing rounds.

17
00:00:56,563 --> 00:01:00,762
Are you sure there isn't anybody
here, or the attorney...?

18
00:01:00,996 --> 00:01:03,686
I mean, do I really have to
be the one to handle this?

19
00:01:03,782 --> 00:01:06,849
We're talking about her estate,
finances, medical care.

20
00:01:06,896 --> 00:01:09,035
You really want to leave her
life in someone else's hands?

21
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:10,142
She's your mother.

22
00:01:11,836 --> 00:01:14,007
Really, really sucks.

23
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:18,564
Adults have to be places and do things

24
00:01:18,605 --> 00:01:21,647
and earn a living and pay the rent.

25
00:01:21,891 --> 00:01:23,643
And if you're training to be a surgeon,

26
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,065
holding a human heart in your hands -

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,825
Hello! Talk about responsibility!

28
00:01:34,145 --> 00:01:35,378
What was that, Dr. Grey?

29
00:01:35,435 --> 00:01:37,027
Sorry, it slipped.

30
00:01:37,104 --> 00:01:37,917
My hands...

31
00:01:38,497 --> 00:01:39,777
It's okay. I'm done.

32
00:01:40,344 --> 00:01:42,214
You can release Mrs. Patterson's heart now,

33
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:43,800
very gently.

34
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:48,623
All right.

35
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:50,492
Let's warm her up.

36
00:01:51,036 --> 00:01:52,020
Get her off bypass.

37
00:01:52,075 --> 00:01:55,377
Kind of makes bikes and cookies look
really, really good, doesn't it?

38
00:01:55,608 --> 00:01:57,279
I wish I could hold a heart.

39
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,746
A monkey could hold a heart.

40
00:01:59,423 --> 00:02:01,086
You're mad Burke didn't ask you.

41
00:02:01,157 --> 00:02:03,489
George, I need more ice and chips.

42
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:04,542
Who did you invite?

43
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:08,418
We said the list was jocks only
- surgery, trauma, plastics.

44
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,248
Who else?

45
00:02:09,447 --> 00:02:10,753
Some people from peds.

46
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,769
You invited the preschoolers to Meredith's house.

47
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,226
Next thing, you'll say that
you invited the shrinks.

48
00:02:17,614 --> 00:02:19,197
She invited mental defects.

49
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,440
This party is D.O.A.

50
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:24,244
Meredith thinks this is going to be a
small, meet-your-boyfriend cocktail thing.

51
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,300
Did you clear this with her?

52
00:02:25,364 --> 00:02:26,262
No, but I will.

53
00:02:27,424 --> 00:02:28,525
I promise.

54
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:32,216
Why are you wasting the only weekend your
boyfriend is in town on a big party?

55
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:33,629
Is he bad in bed?

56
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,348
No. I just want him to meet some of my friends.

57
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:40,680
Right. 60 geeks in scrubs are your friends.

58
00:02:43,061 --> 00:02:44,698
Bad sex - sucks for you.

59
00:02:44,771 --> 00:02:46,686
I heard there's a party tonight.
At Meredith's house.

60
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:48,775
- A party?
- Uh, news to me.

61
00:02:48,851 --> 00:02:49,568
No party.

62
00:02:49,649 --> 00:02:50,843
We losing her or what?

63
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,372
- Are the grafts...?
- They're open.

64
00:02:53,649 --> 00:02:56,536
- Temperature?
- She's at 96 and rising.

65
00:02:56,614 --> 00:02:58,139
She should be doing this on her own.

66
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,064
That's her falling.

67
00:03:04,381 --> 00:03:05,630
Continue the progressions.

68
00:03:08,497 --> 00:03:09,839
Come on, Mrs. Patterson.

69
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,835
- Paddles.
- Sets are below 90.

70
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:12,880
Charge.

71
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:14,917
10 joules.

72
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:16,193
Clear.

73
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,751
Come on, Mrs. Patterson.

74
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,932
- Give me 20.
- Charge.

75
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:23,574
There. We have rhythm.

76
00:03:25,543 --> 00:03:26,878
Reluctant heart.

77
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,655
All right.

78
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,401
Let's close.

79
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,731
Keep an eye on her.

80
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:33,323
Good work, everyone.

81
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:37,199
The scariest part about responsibility?

82
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:43,006
When you screw up and let it
slip right through your fingers.

83
00:03:45,582 --> 00:03:48,100
Hey, I heard you did a cabg with Burke.

84
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:49,253
Did you get to hold the heart?

85
00:03:49,485 --> 00:03:50,374
Yeah.

86
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:53,287
It's an amazing feeling. You
never forget the first time.

87
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,977
It was pretty great just to watch.

88
00:03:55,453 --> 00:03:57,239
Vicarious thrills, you know?

89
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,499
Yeah.

90
00:04:05,135 --> 00:04:05,964
See you later.

91
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:07,107
Bye.

92
00:04:18,223 --> 00:04:23,153
I think maybe I did something to
the heart when I was holding it.

93
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:26,659
I nodded off a little, squeezed it.

94
00:04:27,955 --> 00:04:28,902
Oh, please.

95
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,437
The heart's a tough muscle.

96
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,573
It can take a squeeze or two.

97
00:04:32,988 --> 00:04:36,751
My fingernail popped a
glove, cut straight through.

98
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:40,356
George, what if I punctured
Mrs. Patterson's heart?

99
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:45,220
If you had punctured it,

100
00:04:46,428 --> 00:04:48,266
you would have known when they reperfused.

101
00:04:48,313 --> 00:04:50,253
They got her heart beating. The woman's okay.

102
00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:53,504
- So, I shouldn't tell Burke?
- Tell him what?

103
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:55,398
You know, um...

104
00:04:56,607 --> 00:04:58,582
nothing happened. The woman's okay, right?

105
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,183
She's okay.

106
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:02,710
She's fine.

107
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,844
She's fine.

108
00:05:37,012 --> 00:05:38,141
What do you see, George?

109
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:41,177
Hyperinflated lungs - cloudy with bullae.

110
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:43,240
Seriously diminished capacity.

111
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,288
She must be having trouble breathing.

112
00:05:46,036 --> 00:05:47,126
Course of action?

113
00:05:47,198 --> 00:05:50,721
A bullectomy procedure. Remove the bullae.
Reduce the pressure.

114
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:53,102
It says here we operated on her back in '99.

115
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:56,307
So Mrs. Drake has been through this
before, but talk her through it anyway.

116
00:05:56,384 --> 00:05:58,697
And resist the anti-smoking lectures.

117
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:00,444
She feels bad enough already.

118
00:06:03,644 --> 00:06:05,601
So, do you think, if they
put a picture of these in

119
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:07,582
a pack of cigarettes,
people would stop smoking?

120
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,085
How long has your back been hurting you?

121
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:14,990
It's chronic.

122
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:17,228
Means I have it all the time.

123
00:06:17,283 --> 00:06:18,656
I know what "chronic" means.

124
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:19,909
What kind of pain are you having?

125
00:06:19,987 --> 00:06:20,935
Oh, man, the pain's bad.

126
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,830
It's like a thousand samurai warriors
stabbing their swords into my spine.

127
00:06:25,058 --> 00:06:27,263
I'm allergic to aspirin, most nsaids.

128
00:06:27,323 --> 00:06:28,584
So, maybe we'll start you on morphine.

129
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,518
No. The only things that will work are, uh,

130
00:06:31,584 --> 00:06:35,839
demerol or dilaudid. A ton of
dilaudid - that will set me straight.

131
00:06:36,247 --> 00:06:38,359
The standard starting dose is two.

132
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:40,621
Did you see that tom cruise samurai movie, hmm?

133
00:06:40,785 --> 00:06:42,147
Pow! Pow! Pow!

134
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,032
Exaggerated and overly specific
description of his pain.

135
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,334
A self-prescription.

136
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,166
"Pow! Pow! Pow!"?

137
00:06:49,268 --> 00:06:50,503
He's a dilaudid junkie.

138
00:06:50,574 --> 00:06:51,425
So what do you do?

139
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:54,629
Check the database for history,
refer to a program, and discharge.

140
00:06:54,717 --> 00:06:55,920
After you give him something.

141
00:06:56,473 --> 00:06:57,870
That's exactly what he wants.

142
00:06:57,938 --> 00:07:00,891
Junkie or not, you still have to
treat his pain as if it were real.

143
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:01,699
Why?

144
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:04,864
The first rule in pain management -
always ERR on the side of caution.

145
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,808
He's in our care. He says he's in pain.

146
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:09,112
Start a central line. His veins are shot.

147
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:19,851
The surgery before was supposed to help.

148
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:22,816
But it never felt right.

149
00:07:23,015 --> 00:07:25,083
Probably would have been a
good idea to quit smoking.

150
00:07:25,182 --> 00:07:26,328
I did!

151
00:07:26,563 --> 00:07:28,105
Four-pack-a-day habit.

152
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:29,113
It was hell.

153
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,214
Here you go, Mrs. Drake.

154
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:31,546
Didn't do any good.

155
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:33,321
Really? Because it looked...

156
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,310
I mean, from the damage, we all thought
you probably were still smoking.

157
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,037
Cold turkey, five years ago, and
what did I get for my trouble?

158
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:43,414
I still had to quit my job at the restaurant.

159
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,063
But even sitting, it hurt.

160
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:46,096
Here you go.

161
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:48,687
Nobody believed me. They all
said it was in my head.

162
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,876
I've seen the films.

163
00:07:50,351 --> 00:07:51,697
It's not all in your head.

164
00:07:52,482 --> 00:07:53,842
You're right about that.

165
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:55,154
Hey, come here.

166
00:07:56,357 --> 00:07:58,445
You're too damn young to be a doctor.

167
00:07:58,553 --> 00:08:00,038
- Hey.
- What?

168
00:08:00,975 --> 00:08:02,605
I'm older than I look.

169
00:08:04,124 --> 00:08:06,521
Do you think this is going to work this time?

170
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,968
I think it's your best option.

171
00:08:08,717 --> 00:08:09,822
Straight shooter, huh?

172
00:08:09,895 --> 00:08:10,698
Yes, ma'am.

173
00:08:10,784 --> 00:08:11,957
I like that.

174
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:29,673
Hi, Mr. Patterson.

175
00:08:30,405 --> 00:08:31,066
Hi.

176
00:08:31,265 --> 00:08:32,612
Hemodynamics stable?

177
00:08:32,739 --> 00:08:35,673
Yeah, map has stayed around 80.
Cardiac output at 5.

178
00:08:35,837 --> 00:08:38,859
- That's good, Dr. Grey?
- That's fine, Mr. Patterson.

179
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:40,558
But it's not good.

180
00:08:40,743 --> 00:08:43,159
Well, heart surgery takes
a lot out of the patient,

181
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:45,985
but we're monitoring your wife very carefully,

182
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:47,645
and she should be fine.

183
00:08:52,835 --> 00:08:55,217
Mr. Sterman, let's see about
getting you out of here today.

184
00:08:55,683 --> 00:08:56,584
How are you feeling?

185
00:08:57,117 --> 00:09:01,539
Pretty okay, except I don't think I ever
want to have a bowel obstruction again.

186
00:09:01,602 --> 00:09:02,304
Really?

187
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,760
We get people in here all the time requesting one.

188
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:08,236
So, you keeping down clear fluids?

189
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:11,744
And my all-time favorite
question - have you pooped yet?

190
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:13,905
I'm not exactly sure.

191
00:09:14,432 --> 00:09:16,972
I think you'd probably know.

192
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:19,260
Passed gas?

193
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:20,791
Yes.

194
00:09:21,011 --> 00:09:23,515
Really yes? Because if I bring
in my handy lie detector...

195
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:24,555
Okay, no.

196
00:09:25,286 --> 00:09:28,152
And I shouldn't try and lie. I know.

197
00:09:28,272 --> 00:09:29,809
I went to medical school.

198
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:31,338
You went to med school?

199
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,929
Yeah, dropped out my last year at clinical.

200
00:09:34,247 --> 00:09:39,085
Too many hours, and I was staring
into the ice-cold eyes of divorce.

201
00:09:39,147 --> 00:09:39,807
Wow.

202
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:44,902
Yeah, I do research now, and
I have a life - a family.

203
00:09:45,547 --> 00:09:47,017
No offense. I mean...

204
00:09:47,091 --> 00:09:49,243
No, no, that's okay.

205
00:09:49,377 --> 00:09:51,450
I'm just one of those people
who believe you can have both.

206
00:09:52,198 --> 00:09:53,278
Maybe so.

207
00:09:53,697 --> 00:09:57,083
But your first responsibility's
always gonna be your patient.

208
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:20,994
Just coffee.

209
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:24,756
Good.

210
00:10:24,897 --> 00:10:26,215
Okay.

211
00:11:03,658 --> 00:11:06,481
We call this "a spaghetti procedure."

212
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:09,577
We cut and deflate the bullae

213
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:12,987
to facilitate gentle manipulation

214
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:15,394
of Mrs. Drake's lung.

215
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:19,121
Dr. Bailey, do you see that?

216
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:20,648
Sir?

217
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:25,496
Oh, my ever-lovin'...

218
00:11:25,624 --> 00:11:27,192
We need to open her up.

219
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,695
I'm taking out the scope.

220
00:11:30,242 --> 00:11:32,025
You heard him, people. Let's move.

221
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,048
Lights.

222
00:11:34,191 --> 00:11:35,029
10 blade.

223
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:36,469
- Here you go.
- Retractors.

224
00:11:37,438 --> 00:11:38,162
Retractors.

225
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,056
Scalpel ready.

226
00:11:43,554 --> 00:11:44,355
Towel.

227
00:11:47,177 --> 00:11:48,522
Rib spreader.

228
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:52,761
Suction.

229
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:03,763
Is that a towel?

230
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,007
Get a pan.

231
00:12:05,514 --> 00:12:06,538
Where did that come from?

232
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,856
Best guess - her surgery five years ago.

233
00:12:11,284 --> 00:12:14,730
Something careless this way comes.

234
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:23,899
- A towel?
- Not good.

235
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:26,685
She complained of pressure on her
chest, but nobody took her seriously.

236
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:29,034
Not good for the patient,
not good for the hospital.

237
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:30,125
Not good.

238
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:32,137
Cristina, hit the files.

239
00:12:32,214 --> 00:12:34,472
Find out everything you can
about that initial operation.

240
00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:35,306
Who was in that room?

241
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:36,776
Who was responsible for closing?

242
00:12:36,863 --> 00:12:38,235
George, stay with the patient.

243
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:39,965
Keep her happy. She seems to like you.

244
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:42,290
Right, okay, um, how long do you think...?

245
00:12:42,772 --> 00:12:45,582
I mean, just technically, I'm off at 6:00.

246
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:47,037
Am I invited?

247
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:48,121
Excuse me?

248
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,889
Am I invited to the party?

249
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,901
Well, yeah. Yes, yeah, of course.

250
00:12:57,764 --> 00:12:59,648
What was I supposed to say?

251
00:13:04,728 --> 00:13:07,824
Okay, yeah, great. All right, 14 cases.

252
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:11,306
What kind? I don't know. Maybe an assortment.

253
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:14,778
Microbrews - locals.

254
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,747
Make sure they throw in some bar nuts.

255
00:13:17,973 --> 00:13:19,806
I'm ordering office supplies.

256
00:13:19,885 --> 00:13:20,883
Oh, yeah, sure.

257
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,419
Microbrews - local. And throw in some bar nuts.

258
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,287
7:00 would be better than 5:00.

259
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:27,471
Hey, any luck?

260
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,599
Hey, if I do, will you invite me to the party?

261
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,879
Yeah, great. Okay, thanks.

262
00:13:35,344 --> 00:13:37,756
- Take it easy.
- Mr. Frost.

263
00:13:37,847 --> 00:13:40,035
- Where have you been?!
- We're going to take care of you, all right?

264
00:13:40,107 --> 00:13:42,293
- Just hang on.
- Where the hell have you been?!

265
00:13:46,082 --> 00:13:51,038
When I tell you to start a central line, you
start a central line - no judgment, no question.

266
00:13:51,135 --> 00:13:53,846
Guy's been in seven hospitals in the
last four months. He's a major addict.

267
00:13:53,947 --> 00:13:56,286
The patient has a three-lumbar fusion.

268
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,246
He's a junkie. We shouldn't be giving him -

269
00:13:58,308 --> 00:14:01,299
Yeah, he's an addict, but his pain is real.

270
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,262
Lose the attitude, get down
there, start a central line.

271
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:24,963
Told me I had a towel inside me.

272
00:14:25,506 --> 00:14:26,561
Who told you that?

273
00:14:27,856 --> 00:14:30,924
A surgeon - an older man.

274
00:14:31,476 --> 00:14:32,576
Handsome.

275
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:34,435
That's Dr. Webber.

276
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,654
He's our chief.

277
00:14:36,152 --> 00:14:36,918
Yeah.

278
00:14:38,348 --> 00:14:44,568
It was a towel that somebody left the last time.

279
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:45,527
Yes, ma'am.

280
00:14:45,987 --> 00:14:47,441
Who would do that?

281
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,867
That doesn't seem right, does it?

282
00:14:56,544 --> 00:14:57,998
No, ma'am, no.

283
00:14:58,534 --> 00:14:59,421
It doesn't.

284
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:04,311
I was walking around with a towel inside of me.

285
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,855
How could that happen?

286
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:49,223
So? What happens now?

287
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:57,549
Now you keep this to yourself
while we work it out.

288
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,134
Do this for me.

289
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,189
You okay?

290
00:16:18,424 --> 00:16:19,540
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

291
00:16:19,622 --> 00:16:21,036
Are you sure? Because you seem not okay.

292
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,193
I'm fine. Cabg was long.

293
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:27,093
Well, let me take you out to dinner tonight.
You can tell me all about it.

294
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:30,189
Real food, waiters, big
chunks of carbs in a basket.

295
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:31,137
I can't.

296
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:32,376
Forget the party.

297
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:33,893
You know about the party?

298
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,748
Your friends will be at the party. You
and I can be alone somewhere else.

299
00:16:36,911 --> 00:16:38,151
How do you know about the party?

300
00:16:38,242 --> 00:16:40,665
Thanks for not inviting me, by the way.
That felt good.

301
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:42,974
Dinner - think about dinner. Perfect opportunity.

302
00:16:43,322 --> 00:16:43,998
Well...

303
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:49,339
What happened?

304
00:16:49,472 --> 00:16:52,354
Started having swelling over her
sternum, then blood started gushing.

305
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,706
Dr. Burke is on his way right now.

306
00:16:53,798 --> 00:16:54,780
Is she dying?

307
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:57,483
Somebody get him out of here.
Keep applying pressure.

308
00:16:57,967 --> 00:16:59,771
Tyler, call for an O.R.

309
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:01,371
What the hell happened? She got her protamine?

310
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:05,104
Per protocol. No allergic,
anaphylactic, or histamine responses.

311
00:17:05,985 --> 00:17:07,126
Her last counts?

312
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:11,329
B.T., P.T.T., I.N.R., platelet
counts were all stable.

313
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,018
Even her H.N.H. were stable.

314
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:14,606
What the hell went wrong? Let's move.

315
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:16,366
Hold on.

316
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:21,324
- I popped a glove.
- What?

317
00:17:21,591 --> 00:17:23,591
In surgery, when I was holding it,

318
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:26,912
I popped a glove with my fingernail.
I think I may have nicked her heart.

319
00:17:27,821 --> 00:17:28,999
Let's go, people.

320
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:38,724
What were you thinking about?

321
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,659
You had every opportunity to speak up before
I closed her chest. Every opportunity.

322
00:17:42,984 --> 00:17:44,054
- Suction...
- Suction...

323
00:17:44,255 --> 00:17:44,910
I'm sorry.

324
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:46,934
And then you confess in front of her husband?

325
00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:50,573
You don't even know if you were the cause.
You have no idea.

326
00:17:50,675 --> 00:17:51,673
I'm sorry.

327
00:17:58,371 --> 00:17:59,133
Over here.

328
00:18:00,255 --> 00:18:01,002
There.

329
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:03,135
Look at the wall rupture.

330
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:05,242
It's a hell of a lot more than a fingernail.

331
00:18:05,677 --> 00:18:07,725
Her ventricular walls are weak.

332
00:18:09,016 --> 00:18:12,261
I just had a conversation with Mr. Patterson.

333
00:18:12,436 --> 00:18:16,065
I want copies of his wife's
chart in my office by 5:00.

334
00:18:16,139 --> 00:18:18,691
Tomorrow, the two of you are
going to meet with me and legal,

335
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:21,682
and you better damn well be able
to explain what happened here.

336
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:26,526
People poking holes in hearts and leaving towels.

337
00:18:27,317 --> 00:18:30,596
You're gonna go back and talk to the husband.

338
00:18:30,806 --> 00:18:32,153
Review the history.

339
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:34,805
Apologize profusely.

340
00:18:35,358 --> 00:18:37,447
Your ass is on the line here, Dr. Grey.

341
00:18:42,275 --> 00:18:43,745
You got called before the chief?

342
00:18:43,811 --> 00:18:44,979
Tomorrow morning.

343
00:18:45,106 --> 00:18:46,888
I could get kicked out of the program.

344
00:18:47,763 --> 00:18:48,956
I could, right?

345
00:18:49,043 --> 00:18:50,037
You're not getting kicked out.

346
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:51,409
Patterson's just gonna sue.

347
00:18:51,517 --> 00:18:52,986
Patterson is not going to sue.

348
00:18:53,068 --> 00:18:54,425
You're not getting kicked out.

349
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:57,184
What were you thinking? Telling Burke? So stupid.

350
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,060
I told her not to.

351
00:18:59,883 --> 00:19:01,014
I got to take this.

352
00:19:02,654 --> 00:19:04,722
Thanks. Thank you. Very comforting.

353
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:05,617
I'll watch your books.

354
00:19:07,221 --> 00:19:12,515
Okay, so the beer is coming at 7:00, and
some of the floor nurses are bringing wine.

355
00:19:12,821 --> 00:19:14,696
You invited nurses?

356
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,194
Did you clear this with Meredith?

357
00:19:17,271 --> 00:19:18,938
A few more people isn't gonna
make a difference, okay?

358
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:20,266
A party is a party.

359
00:19:20,383 --> 00:19:23,030
And the bigger the party,
the less time for bad sex.

360
00:19:23,132 --> 00:19:24,669
Would you stop saying that.

361
00:19:24,745 --> 00:19:27,615
- Okay.
- Hank and I have great sex - all the time.

362
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,276
We'll probably have sex after
the party, or during the party.

363
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:32,790
As long as you clear it with Meredith.

364
00:19:34,368 --> 00:19:36,558
Hank just needs to realize
that doctors can have fun.

365
00:19:36,615 --> 00:19:39,328
We're not all workaholics with god complexes.

366
00:19:39,369 --> 00:19:41,580
We are workaholics with god complexes.

367
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:49,563
And the notary can be there at 6:30, too?

368
00:19:51,211 --> 00:19:54,755
And the home's physician will be there
to attest to her mental competency?

369
00:19:55,749 --> 00:19:56,568
Okay.

370
00:19:57,161 --> 00:20:00,648
Is there anything else I need
to bring beside my license?

371
00:20:01,288 --> 00:20:02,506
My checkbook.

372
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,282
6:30- I'll be there.

373
00:20:06,807 --> 00:20:07,626
I heard.

374
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,088
It's a notary thing - a thing to get notarized.

375
00:20:11,155 --> 00:20:12,423
I'm talking about the heart thing.

376
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:13,663
Do you want to talk about it?

377
00:20:15,143 --> 00:20:16,192
We're adults.

378
00:20:17,017 --> 00:20:18,547
When did that happen?

379
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:23,386
And how do we make it stop?

380
00:20:39,427 --> 00:20:40,252
Dr. Yang.

381
00:20:41,347 --> 00:20:42,156
Dr. Burke.

382
00:20:45,341 --> 00:20:47,461
That bypass graft got a little complicated.

383
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:49,796
It's nothing I couldn't handle.

384
00:20:51,177 --> 00:20:51,741
Good.

385
00:21:01,933 --> 00:21:02,693
Yeah.

386
00:21:07,401 --> 00:21:10,168
Listen, I'll call you back.

387
00:21:13,547 --> 00:21:16,296
That was my lawyer. He's
advising me not to talk to you.

388
00:21:16,383 --> 00:21:19,870
Mr. Patterson, I know that
you're frustrated and angry,

389
00:21:19,952 --> 00:21:24,673
but I need - we need some more
information about your wife.

390
00:21:24,877 --> 00:21:27,141
The walls of her heart are abnormally thin.

391
00:21:27,207 --> 00:21:28,677
Hey, don't blame this on my wife.

392
00:21:28,764 --> 00:21:31,303
I heard from your very mouth
what happened. I know.

393
00:21:31,452 --> 00:21:32,773
But we can't treat her.

394
00:21:32,844 --> 00:21:34,790
No, she was in the best shape of her life.

395
00:21:34,849 --> 00:21:36,101
You ask her cardiologist.

396
00:21:36,178 --> 00:21:37,520
She had lost 100 pounds.

397
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,695
Don't you dare try to hang this on her.

398
00:21:40,047 --> 00:21:42,342
- Mr. Patterson, please.
- We're through talking.

399
00:22:05,545 --> 00:22:08,014
You don't like me very much, do you?

400
00:22:08,252 --> 00:22:13,390
Oh, Jerry, it's not you specifically.
It's just people like you, that's all.

401
00:22:14,153 --> 00:22:16,620
Doc, I'm feeling pretty good.

402
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,909
Pain's about a 3.

403
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:20,768
A 3? That's excellent.

404
00:22:21,115 --> 00:22:25,615
Mr. Frost, I'm glad we could help you out,
as well as county, mercy west, seattle pres.

405
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,853
A lot of people have helped you out lately, Jerry.

406
00:22:27,895 --> 00:22:29,150
We're pleased we could do our part.

407
00:22:29,436 --> 00:22:31,223
Who's on discharge today, Dr. Karev?

408
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:32,410
Izzie Stevens.

409
00:22:32,594 --> 00:22:34,790
Mr. Frost, Dr. Stevens is gonna discharge you.

410
00:22:34,863 --> 00:22:36,548
Whoa, you can't discharge me.

411
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:38,923
- I'm in pain.
- You were in pain. Now you're not.

412
00:22:39,189 --> 00:22:43,111
Dr. Karev here is going to recommend some
wonderful treatment programs for you.

413
00:22:43,183 --> 00:22:43,966
Go home.

414
00:22:44,365 --> 00:22:45,416
Get some help.

415
00:22:45,712 --> 00:22:47,059
You can't just do that!

416
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,527
He just did, my friend.

417
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,823
Okay, any luck yet?

418
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:54,283
Nada.

419
00:22:55,076 --> 00:22:57,442
Ugh. Looks like you're gonna
have to spend another night.

420
00:22:58,097 --> 00:22:59,971
I hate to miss the party.

421
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,660
You gonna make it?

422
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,066
You are the last person on my list,
so it's looking pretty good.

423
00:23:05,152 --> 00:23:08,599
So, doctors have lives after all.
Who'd have thunk?

424
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,773
Dr. Stevens, discharge my guy in 342.

425
00:23:15,168 --> 00:23:16,520
Don't look at me like that.

426
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:17,988
It's not gonna take very long.

427
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:20,221
It's not.

428
00:23:25,926 --> 00:23:26,770
You paged me?

429
00:23:26,964 --> 00:23:29,566
I'm gonna be a while. Do you think you
could get home to sign for the beer?

430
00:23:29,657 --> 00:23:32,125
Why don't you have your boyfriend sign for it?

431
00:23:33,744 --> 00:23:36,729
You have a very annoying way
of sneaking up on people.

432
00:23:36,939 --> 00:23:38,648
Maybe if you were a little less creepy...

433
00:23:38,741 --> 00:23:39,915
I wouldn't come anyway.

434
00:23:40,077 --> 00:23:41,169
I hate big parties.

435
00:23:41,307 --> 00:23:44,416
Is Meredith the only person who
doesn't know the size of this thing?

436
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:45,565
I'm telling her.

437
00:23:45,746 --> 00:23:47,108
You can't. She's gone already.

438
00:23:47,189 --> 00:23:48,091
What, already?

439
00:23:48,311 --> 00:23:52,391
I think she had - um, excuse
me - an errand to run.

440
00:23:53,303 --> 00:23:55,950
You don't think Meredith's going to mind, right?

441
00:23:56,028 --> 00:23:59,785
I want you to make it very clear to her
that I had nothing to do with this party -

442
00:23:59,861 --> 00:24:00,723
nothing.

443
00:24:12,754 --> 00:24:14,516
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late. It was the traffic.

444
00:24:14,576 --> 00:24:15,636
It doesn't matter, dear.

445
00:24:15,763 --> 00:24:17,900
Okay. Don't tell me the notary didn't show.

446
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:20,751
Oh, everybody's here. It's just your mother isn't.

447
00:24:23,122 --> 00:24:23,864
Mom?

448
00:24:24,484 --> 00:24:25,113
Mom?

449
00:24:25,768 --> 00:24:26,972
What do you people want from me?

450
00:24:27,396 --> 00:24:29,389
We need you to sign the lawyer's papers.

451
00:24:29,466 --> 00:24:32,318
I have a cranial reconstruction
in a half an hour. I need to go.

452
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,201
Okay, mom. We're all here.

453
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:35,268
We have a notary.

454
00:24:35,436 --> 00:24:36,747
I need you to focus,

455
00:24:36,961 --> 00:24:38,929
and I need you to sign these papers.

456
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,891
Mom, look at me.

457
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:45,850
It's an emergency surgery.

458
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:46,981
I don't have time for this.

459
00:24:47,084 --> 00:24:48,722
She can't sign anything now.

460
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:51,353
We should have done this earlier in the day.

461
00:24:51,415 --> 00:24:53,177
I couldn't come earlier in the day.

462
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,510
I have a job and a life, and I'm here now.

463
00:24:56,597 --> 00:24:59,336
You're gonna have to come back
tomorrow, when she's lucid.

464
00:24:59,476 --> 00:25:02,097
You know, why did she put this off for so long?

465
00:25:02,183 --> 00:25:03,550
And why did you let her?

466
00:25:03,616 --> 00:25:06,120
Doesn't it strike you as slightly irresponsible?

467
00:25:06,219 --> 00:25:08,620
I mean, what the hell is wrong with you people?!

468
00:26:31,404 --> 00:26:33,821
Izzie, I'm gonna kill you.

469
00:26:40,827 --> 00:26:43,311
You could touch that, but I'd have to kill you.

470
00:26:48,949 --> 00:26:50,299
So, about that towel thing?

471
00:26:50,387 --> 00:26:51,642
It's been taken care of.

472
00:26:52,491 --> 00:26:53,239
Okay.

473
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:56,541
You don't need to concern yourself with it.

474
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:57,958
So, what's gonna happen?

475
00:26:58,047 --> 00:27:01,067
We're not gonna talk about it anymore
is what's gonna happen - we clear?

476
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:04,216
Or you had too much alcohol to understand me?

477
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:05,845
We're very clear.

478
00:27:05,973 --> 00:27:06,649
Good.

479
00:27:07,805 --> 00:27:09,019
You have any bourbon?

480
00:27:17,211 --> 00:27:18,911
You can't discharge a man in pain.

481
00:27:19,153 --> 00:27:20,380
You're hurting me!

482
00:27:20,462 --> 00:27:22,760
You're the one who's making it difficult.
Stop resisting.

483
00:27:22,836 --> 00:27:24,825
Just give me the hit of demerol.

484
00:27:25,387 --> 00:27:26,898
The dilaudid hasn't worn off yet.

485
00:27:26,955 --> 00:27:29,803
- Mr. Frost, you have to...
- Look, I'm not leaving.

486
00:27:29,904 --> 00:27:30,830
I'm calling psych.

487
00:27:30,922 --> 00:27:33,099
No, no. Don't call psych.

488
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:33,964
Wait, wait, wait.

489
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:36,422
Stop, Jerry. Stop. Stop. Stop.

490
00:27:41,268 --> 00:27:42,950
Jerry. Jerry!

491
00:27:43,027 --> 00:27:43,717
Concussion?

492
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:48,638
He's blown his left pupil.

493
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,762
Page Shepherd. We gotta get him down to C.T.

494
00:27:53,365 --> 00:27:55,109
That was one hard fall.

495
00:27:55,197 --> 00:27:56,083
What do you see?

496
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:01,833
Subdural bleed.

497
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,312
With midline shift.

498
00:28:03,568 --> 00:28:05,073
We have to evacuate this now.

499
00:28:05,408 --> 00:28:08,739
Anywhere else you have to be,
Dr. Stevens, or are you in?

500
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:10,459
Brain surgery?

501
00:28:11,141 --> 00:28:12,092
Are you kidding me?

502
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:13,214
That's what I thought.

503
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,066
Where is Izzie?!

504
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,246
She didn't clear it with you?

505
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:46,576
This was supposed to be a meet-the-boyfriend
get-together little thing!

506
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:49,038
Izzie has a lot of friends.

507
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:52,987
Izzie doesn't know this many people.

508
00:28:53,069 --> 00:28:54,624
I told her to clear it with you.

509
00:28:54,748 --> 00:28:56,657
I can't handle this.

510
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,388
You want me to kick everyone out?

511
00:28:58,865 --> 00:29:00,764
I'm gonna kick everyone out.

512
00:29:03,886 --> 00:29:06,402
Baby, you made it! Whoo!

513
00:29:08,598 --> 00:29:09,484
Screw it.

514
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,143
Hold this.

515
00:29:12,114 --> 00:29:13,344
And give me this.

516
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:19,579
I made it!

517
00:29:23,324 --> 00:29:25,643
George! George, come here. Come on.

518
00:29:54,382 --> 00:29:55,149
See it?

519
00:29:55,436 --> 00:29:56,219
It's hard to miss.

520
00:29:57,608 --> 00:29:58,805
Little more than he bargained for.

521
00:29:58,927 --> 00:30:01,364
Maybe he's lucky. Maybe this
is his way out of the hole.

522
00:30:01,978 --> 00:30:02,789
The hole?

523
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:04,006
Interesting expression.

524
00:30:05,848 --> 00:30:08,333
My father was into smack pretty heavy.
He was a musician.

525
00:30:08,605 --> 00:30:10,376
It's tolerated in his line of work.

526
00:30:10,504 --> 00:30:11,823
Not good for the family at home.

527
00:30:20,408 --> 00:30:22,838
Why do we want to be surgeons, anyway?

528
00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:24,856
Surgery is a very serious business.

529
00:30:26,532 --> 00:30:27,441
Full house.

530
00:30:29,008 --> 00:30:30,206
Royal flush.

531
00:30:30,544 --> 00:30:32,561
Get naked, baby boy.

532
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:36,135
- Surgery is stupid.
- You're so sexy!

533
00:30:36,212 --> 00:30:37,104
It's stupid.

534
00:30:37,358 --> 00:30:38,920
- It's stupid.
- Give me that. You're drunk.

535
00:30:39,351 --> 00:30:40,529
I'm not driving.

536
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:41,788
I'm not on call.

537
00:30:41,885 --> 00:30:43,232
I'm in my own house.

538
00:30:43,338 --> 00:30:44,691
My life is crap.

539
00:30:45,187 --> 00:30:47,864
And it's my party, and I'll
get drunk if I want to.

540
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,618
Is, um, Izzie Stevens...?

541
00:30:51,699 --> 00:30:53,225
Oh, you must be Hank.

542
00:30:56,544 --> 00:30:58,585
He's very large and hockey-like.

543
00:30:58,684 --> 00:31:00,076
No, Izzie's not here right now.

544
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:01,649
Okay.

545
00:31:02,533 --> 00:31:06,363
You and Izzie will give birth
to very tall, blond people...

546
00:31:06,773 --> 00:31:07,771
like barbies.

547
00:31:07,921 --> 00:31:09,360
Izzie said she was gonna be at home.

548
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,966
She didn't say there was gonna be a party.

549
00:31:11,065 --> 00:31:12,985
Well, she pisses both of us off.

550
00:31:13,256 --> 00:31:14,994
Would you like some tequila? It helps.

551
00:31:15,095 --> 00:31:16,787
When do you think she's gonna get here?

552
00:31:16,861 --> 00:31:17,668
Don't know.

553
00:31:17,981 --> 00:31:19,875
Look, we're low on ice, Hank.

554
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,719
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

555
00:31:22,942 --> 00:31:24,294
We're interns, Hank.

556
00:31:24,607 --> 00:31:27,310
The hospital owns us. It's what we do.

557
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:30,603
Bye.

558
00:31:30,894 --> 00:31:31,847
Nice to meet you.

559
00:31:32,942 --> 00:31:34,427
Can you guys see him through recovery?

560
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,234
- Yeah, I'll take it.
- No, I can do it.

561
00:31:36,404 --> 00:31:37,702
That's okay, Stevens.

562
00:31:37,893 --> 00:31:39,213
He's my patient now, too.

563
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:41,635
No, I got it. See your hockey player. I'm serious.

564
00:31:42,823 --> 00:31:43,549
Yeah, okay.

565
00:31:44,477 --> 00:31:45,767
I guess. Thanks, Alex.

566
00:31:46,334 --> 00:31:47,288
No problem.

567
00:32:01,858 --> 00:32:02,557
Hey!

568
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,571
Hey.

569
00:32:03,975 --> 00:32:04,890
What are you doing here?

570
00:32:10,614 --> 00:32:12,392
I'm sorry I didn't have a chance to call.

571
00:32:13,283 --> 00:32:14,987
My patient needed brain surgery.

572
00:32:15,377 --> 00:32:17,881
Like, we were inside his brain. How cool is that?

573
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:20,467
Oh, my god.

574
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:25,534
There's a party at your house.

575
00:32:25,633 --> 00:32:27,154
Yeah, did you get a chance to hang out?

576
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,976
I wanted you to meet some
of the people I work with.

577
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:33,267
I don't care about the people you work with.
I just want to see you.

578
00:32:34,115 --> 00:32:37,419
You didn't mind meeting the people I
worked with when they were models.

579
00:32:37,604 --> 00:32:42,129
Yeah, well, when they were models, you
actually showed up to your own parties.

580
00:32:43,384 --> 00:32:44,192
Yeah.

581
00:32:48,724 --> 00:32:50,869
This is my life now, Hank.

582
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:53,096
I work 100-hour weeks.

583
00:32:53,486 --> 00:32:55,661
I can't always show up to my own parties on time.

584
00:32:55,743 --> 00:32:57,873
My patients have to come first. It's just...

585
00:32:58,078 --> 00:33:03,010
Yeah, I just flew across the entire country,
and there's a hundred people at your house.

586
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,062
A hundred people who understand what I do all day.

587
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,196
I shouldn't have to apologize for that.

588
00:33:07,714 --> 00:33:09,199
No, you shouldn't.

589
00:33:16,674 --> 00:33:19,874
Look, let's just go by the
party for a little while.

590
00:33:20,305 --> 00:33:22,910
You'll really like everyone once
you get a chance to know them.

591
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:26,105
I should just go.

592
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,754
Hank, come on.

593
00:33:30,837 --> 00:33:31,695
I'll call you.

594
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:30,864
You know, in some states,
you get arrested for that.

595
00:34:44,403 --> 00:34:46,587
So, you blew me off for a bottle of tequila.

596
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,169
Tequila's no good for you -

597
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,722
doesn't call, doesn't write.

598
00:34:49,937 --> 00:34:52,067
It's not nearly as much fun to wake up to.

599
00:35:06,551 --> 00:35:08,318
Take me for a ride, Derek.

600
00:35:14,205 --> 00:35:16,607
You know, it sounds like the party's winding down.

601
00:35:17,118 --> 00:35:18,987
- Listen to me!
- What?

602
00:35:19,065 --> 00:35:20,862
We should probably sneak inside now.

603
00:35:21,932 --> 00:35:24,036
We've done enough sneaking for the night.

604
00:35:24,103 --> 00:35:25,956
It was good sneaking, but enough sneaking.

605
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,492
Yeah, I'd say we're pretty good sneakers.

606
00:35:33,594 --> 00:35:35,509
You mind moving this tail wagon?

607
00:35:35,581 --> 00:35:36,933
You're blocking me in.

608
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:41,629
Apparently not good enough.

609
00:36:11,163 --> 00:36:12,697
When's your meeting with the chief?

610
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:15,935
In an hour.

611
00:36:21,018 --> 00:36:23,041
Holy mother of destruction.

612
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,371
You missed doctor-palooza.

613
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,320
Apparently, you didn't.

614
00:36:28,976 --> 00:36:31,268
I should probably never speak to you again.

615
00:36:32,555 --> 00:36:33,926
I'm so sorry, Meredith.

616
00:36:34,315 --> 00:36:36,169
I had no idea it was going to get so...

617
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:37,852
It's okay.

618
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,008
Really, I don't care.

619
00:36:40,945 --> 00:36:42,619
What would I be doing, anyway?

620
00:36:42,871 --> 00:36:45,046
Preparing for your career-altering meeting.

621
00:36:45,221 --> 00:36:46,173
Sorry.

622
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:48,210
That heart wall shouldn't have torn.

623
00:36:48,912 --> 00:36:50,525
Anything in the patient's history?

624
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:54,400
Husband said she was in the
best shape of her life.

625
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:57,084
She lost 100 pounds last year.

626
00:36:57,867 --> 00:37:00,442
100 pounds in a year - how's her muscle mass?

627
00:37:04,334 --> 00:37:06,279
Do you even know whose that was?

628
00:37:07,317 --> 00:37:08,460
I'm hoping it was yours.

629
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,576
No.

630
00:37:13,261 --> 00:37:14,688
What do you think?

631
00:37:15,727 --> 00:37:20,091
50 says Meredith gets tossed out on
her ass and Burke walks away clean.

632
00:37:20,183 --> 00:37:21,396
Please be nice to her.

633
00:37:23,045 --> 00:37:25,953
So, I have done a lot of research on this,

634
00:37:26,004 --> 00:37:28,257
and Dr. Burke has been kind enough to help me.

635
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:32,528
And I understand my responsibility
in what I've done wrong here.

636
00:37:32,594 --> 00:37:37,155
However, I do think the patient's
history is significant in this case.

637
00:37:37,227 --> 00:37:39,270
She still weighs 200 pounds,

638
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:41,282
which is why no one even noticed it.

639
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:44,395
But, with that kind of a weight drop,
it doesn't matter how much you weigh -

640
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:46,145
technically, you're anorexic.

641
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,346
Along with all that fat, she
was losing heart muscle.

642
00:37:49,408 --> 00:37:52,644
That certainly could be the reason for
a small poke to become a large tear.

643
00:37:52,701 --> 00:37:54,578
That still doesn't change the fact, though.

644
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,697
The small poke wasn't reported at
the time of the occurrence.

645
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,529
- And if I could change that...
- And you can't.

646
00:38:00,621 --> 00:38:03,871
You've left yourself and the hospital
open to a tremendous amount of liability.

647
00:38:03,929 --> 00:38:07,259
- Not if the weight loss caused the problem.
- I'm sorry, I've no choice...

648
00:38:07,315 --> 00:38:11,879
I've spoken to the husband, and I believe
as long as his wife remains stable -

649
00:38:11,948 --> 00:38:15,310
I can't take your beliefs to the bank, Dr. Burke.

650
00:38:15,424 --> 00:38:17,778
- Dr. Grey made a huge error here.
- And she reported it.

651
00:38:17,844 --> 00:38:18,684
Too late.

652
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:20,599
And in front of the patient's husband.

653
00:38:20,686 --> 00:38:22,576
But she reported it. She spoke up.

654
00:38:26,462 --> 00:38:28,514
Five years ago, as a C.T. fellow,

655
00:38:28,782 --> 00:38:31,295
I had a nagging feeling that I
didn't check the body cavity

656
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:34,050
of a lung patient closely enough before I closed.

657
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:37,162
The patient seemed fine
post-op, and I was in a hurry.

658
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:43,839
And yesterday you and Dr. Bailey pulled a
towel out from under that patient's lung.

659
00:38:44,034 --> 00:38:46,838
Why didn't I report it at an appropriate time?

660
00:38:46,879 --> 00:38:49,701
Maybe because I was afraid that I would be called

661
00:38:49,743 --> 00:38:54,617
into a meeting where some hospital lawyer's
fear of liability could end my career.

662
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:58,927
Even great doctors make mistakes, and when we do,

663
00:38:59,005 --> 00:39:02,742
we've got to have a chance to speak
up without fear of retribution.

664
00:39:03,434 --> 00:39:04,832
Or everyone suffers.

665
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:06,931
Dr. Grey spoke up.

666
00:39:19,177 --> 00:39:22,768
Responsibility - it really does suck.

667
00:39:27,682 --> 00:39:29,030
Meredith. You okay?

668
00:39:29,101 --> 00:39:30,550
Yeah, one-month probation.

669
00:39:30,631 --> 00:39:32,264
- That's good.
- Yep.

670
00:39:32,499 --> 00:39:34,036
Burke saved my ass.

671
00:39:34,118 --> 00:39:37,364
Don't you all have something better to do?
Come on, people, move!

672
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,849
He was always gonna tell them about the towel.

673
00:39:41,911 --> 00:39:43,723
Just wanted to wait for the right time.

674
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:46,063
Information is power.

675
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:21,060
Unfortunately, once you get past the
age of braces and training bras,

676
00:40:21,413 --> 00:40:23,492
responsibility doesn't go away.

677
00:40:27,501 --> 00:40:32,682
Jerry, this is Sloane. She's here to talk to
you, if you want, about options for rehab.

678
00:40:36,621 --> 00:40:38,093
It can't be avoided.

679
00:40:41,501 --> 00:40:42,491
Mrs. Drake,

680
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:46,429
I cannot begin to tell you how truly sorry I am.

681
00:40:47,228 --> 00:40:49,255
Either someone makes us face it,

682
00:40:50,243 --> 00:40:53,493
or we suffer the consequences.

683
00:41:05,475 --> 00:41:08,005
Izzie! I did it! I pooped!

684
00:41:08,076 --> 00:41:09,003
All right!

685
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:15,092
Missed your party?

686
00:41:15,255 --> 00:41:16,218
Life as a surgeon.

687
00:41:16,294 --> 00:41:17,565
And loving every minute of it.

688
00:41:37,215 --> 00:41:41,157
And still, adulthood has its perks.

689
00:41:43,077 --> 00:41:44,383
Thanks for the coffee.

690
00:42:06,225 --> 00:42:11,243
I mean, the shoes, the sex, the no parents
anywhere telling you what to do...

691
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,626
that's pretty damn good.
