1
00:00:02,596 --> 00:00:04,338
Wake up.

2
00:00:04,357 --> 00:00:13,548
Remember when you were a kid and your biggest worry was, like, if you'd get a bike for your birthday or if you'd get to eat cookies for breakfast?

3
00:00:14,788 --> 00:00:15,630
Being an adult?

4
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:17,512
Totally overrated.

5
00:00:19,474 --> 00:00:26,201
I mean, seriously, don't be fooled by all the hot shoes and the great sex and the no parents anywhere telling you what to do.

6
00:00:28,422 --> 00:00:30,966
Adulthood is responsibility.

7
00:00:31,147 --> 00:00:35,938
Her lawyer has been managing her estate with a limited power of attorney, but your mother's Alzheimer's is advancing.

8
00:00:36,057 --> 00:00:39,825
So while she's still lucid enough to consent, she needs to sign everything over to you.

9
00:00:39,884 --> 00:00:45,276
Me?

10
00:00:46,167 --> 00:01:13,996
responsibility it really does suck look I haven't slept in 48 hours I'm getting my first shot at heart surgery this morning I'm missing rounds are you sure there isn't anybody here or the attorney I mean do I really have to be the one to handle this we're talking about her estate her finances her medical care you really want to leave her life in someone else's hands she's your mother really really sucks

11
00:01:15,715 --> 00:01:21,503
Adults have to be places and do things and earn a living and pay the rent.

12
00:01:22,183 --> 00:01:25,868
And if you're training to be a surgeon, holding a human heart in your hands?

13
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:30,475
Hello, talk about responsibility.

14
00:01:34,381 --> 00:01:35,602
What was that, Dr. Gray?

15
00:01:35,623 --> 00:01:36,823
Sorry, it slipped.

16
00:01:37,325 --> 00:01:37,965
My hands.

17
00:01:38,906 --> 00:01:39,528
It's okay, I'm done.

18
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:42,031
You can release Mrs. Patterson's heart now.

19
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:43,713
Very gently.

20
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:49,581
All right.

21
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,201
Let's warm her up.

22
00:01:51,242 --> 00:01:52,024
Get her off bypass.

23
00:01:52,123 --> 00:01:55,087
Kind of makes bikes and cookies look really, really good, doesn't it?

24
00:01:55,929 --> 00:01:57,069
I wish I could hold a heart.

25
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:58,512
A monkey could hold a heart.

26
00:01:59,673 --> 00:02:00,915
You're Matt Burke, didn't ask you.

27
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:03,457
George, I need more ice and chips.

28
00:02:03,638 --> 00:02:04,478
Who else did you invite?

29
00:02:04,498 --> 00:02:06,882
Izzy, we said the list was jocks only.

30
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:08,383
Surgery, trauma, plastics.

31
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:09,044
Who else?

32
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:10,686
Just some people from Peds.

33
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:13,930
You invited the preschoolers to Meredith's house.

34
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,332
Next thing you'll say that you invited the shrinks.

35
00:02:17,814 --> 00:02:18,978
She invited mental defects.

36
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:20,501
This party is DOA.

37
00:02:20,561 --> 00:02:24,449
You know, Meredith thinks this is going to be just like a little small meet your boyfriend cocktail thing.

38
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:25,331
Did you clear this with her?

39
00:02:25,532 --> 00:02:27,698
No, but I will.

40
00:02:27,717 --> 00:02:28,379
I promise.

41
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,948
Why are you wasting the only weekend your boyfriend is in town on a big party?

42
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,731
Is he bad in bed?

43
00:02:34,943 --> 00:02:37,187
No, I just want him to meet some of my friends.

44
00:02:37,727 --> 00:02:37,848
Right.

45
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:40,270
60 Geeks and Scrubs are your friends.

46
00:02:43,376 --> 00:02:43,817
Bad sex.

47
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:44,677
Sucks for you.

48
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:46,921
I heard there's a party tonight at Meredith's house.

49
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:47,262
Oh, really?

50
00:02:47,322 --> 00:02:47,522
A party?

51
00:02:48,144 --> 00:02:48,805
Uh, news to me.

52
00:02:48,824 --> 00:02:49,264
No party.

53
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:50,587
They're losing her or what?

54
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:53,992
Are the grafts here open?

55
00:02:54,013 --> 00:02:54,393
Temperature?

56
00:02:54,713 --> 00:02:56,437
She's at 96 and rising.

57
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:57,878
She should be doing this on her own.

58
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:03,026
That's her phone.

59
00:03:04,474 --> 00:03:08,722
Continue the compressions.

60
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:09,864
Come on, Mrs. Patterson.

61
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:11,566
Paddle sets are below 90.

62
00:03:12,548 --> 00:03:14,390
Charge.

63
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:14,691
10 joules.

64
00:03:15,673 --> 00:03:15,913
Clear.

65
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,838
Come on, Mrs. Patterson.

66
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:21,461
Give me 20.

67
00:03:21,622 --> 00:03:22,463
Charge.

68
00:03:22,484 --> 00:03:22,704
There.

69
00:03:22,984 --> 00:03:23,665
We have rhythm.

70
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:24,026
Nothing yet.

71
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:25,207
There we go.

72
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:26,750
Reluctant heart.

73
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:28,633
All right.

74
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:32,118
Let's close and keep an eye on it.

75
00:03:32,538 --> 00:03:33,299
Good work, everyone.

76
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:37,143
The scariest part about responsibility?

77
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:42,688
When you screw up and let it slip right through your fingers.

78
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:47,873
Hey, I heard you did a cabbage with Brooke.

79
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:48,474
Yeah.

80
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:49,975
Did you get to hold the harp?

81
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:50,236
Yeah.

82
00:03:50,676 --> 00:03:51,177
All right.

83
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:52,419
It's an amazing feeling, isn't it?

84
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:53,560
You never forget the first time.

85
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,760
It was pretty great just to watch.

86
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:56,963
Vicarious thrills, you know?

87
00:03:57,024 --> 00:03:58,224
Yeah.

88
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:14,086
I'll see you later.

89
00:04:14,106 --> 00:04:17,411
Bye.

90
00:04:18,512 --> 00:04:22,778
I think maybe I did something to the heart when I was holding it.

91
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:26,324
I nodded off a little, squeezed it.

92
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:29,288
Oh, please.

93
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:30,470
The heart's a tough muscle.

94
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,632
It can take a squeeze or two.

95
00:04:33,187 --> 00:04:34,528
My fingernail popped a glove.

96
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:36,370
Cut straight through.

97
00:04:37,971 --> 00:04:40,095
George, what if I punctured Mrs. Patterson's heart?

98
00:04:43,278 --> 00:04:48,283
If you hadn't punctured it, you know, you would have known when they reperfused.

99
00:04:48,324 --> 00:04:49,144
They got her heart beating.

100
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:49,966
The woman's okay.

101
00:04:51,586 --> 00:04:52,728
So I shouldn't tell Burke?

102
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:53,249
Tell him what?

103
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,494
You know, um... Nothing happened.

104
00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:58,375
The woman's okay, right?

105
00:05:00,497 --> 00:05:01,177
She's okay.

106
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:02,939
She's fine.

107
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:04,598
She's fine.

108
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:14,475
Nobody knows where they might end up.

109
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:19,803
Nobody knows.

110
00:05:19,824 --> 00:05:28,860
Oh, oh, suppose.

111
00:05:37,108 --> 00:05:38,189
What do you see, George?

112
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:41,014
Hyperinflated lungs, cloudy with boule.

113
00:05:41,995 --> 00:05:43,377
Seriously diminished capacity.

114
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,079
She must be having trouble breathing.

115
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:47,141
Course of action?

116
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,382
A bulectomy procedure.

117
00:05:48,663 --> 00:05:50,644
Remove the boule, reduce the pressure.

118
00:05:50,925 --> 00:05:56,211
Says here we operated on her back in 99, so Mrs. Drake has been through this before, but talk her through it anyway.

119
00:05:56,651 --> 00:05:58,675
And resists the anti-smoking lectures.

120
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:00,416
She feels bad enough already.

121
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:07,127
So do you think if they put a picture of these in a pack of cigarettes, people would stop smoking?

122
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:14,315
How long has your back been hurting you?

123
00:06:14,336 --> 00:06:14,836
It's chronic.

124
00:06:14,857 --> 00:06:17,139
It means I have it all the time.

125
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,401
I know what chronic means.

126
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:19,884
What kind of pain are you having?

127
00:06:20,084 --> 00:06:21,065
Oh, man, the pain's bad.

128
00:06:21,105 --> 00:06:24,670
It's like thousands of samurai warriors stabbing their swords into my spine.

129
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,394
I'm allergic to aspirin, most NSAIDs.

130
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:29,036
So maybe we'll start you on morphine.

131
00:06:29,576 --> 00:06:30,858
Yeah, the only things that'll work are

132
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:34,723
Demerol or Dilaudid, a ton of Dilaudid.

133
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:36,326
That'll set me straight.

134
00:06:36,346 --> 00:06:38,009
The standard starting dose is two.

135
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:40,151
Did you see that Tom Cruise samurai movie?

136
00:06:40,952 --> 00:06:41,012
Hm?

137
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,576
Pow, pow, pow.

138
00:06:43,596 --> 00:06:45,978
Exaggerated and overly specific description of his pain.

139
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,444
A self-prescription, uh, pow, pow, pow.

140
00:06:49,463 --> 00:06:50,565
He's a Dilaudid junkie.

141
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:51,286
So what do you do?

142
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:54,651
Well, you check the database for history, refer to a program, and discharge.

143
00:06:54,932 --> 00:06:56,052
After you give him something.

144
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,869
That's exactly what he wants.

145
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:00,612
Chunky or not, you still have to treat his pain as if it were real.

146
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:01,733
Why?

147
00:07:01,774 --> 00:07:03,136
It's the first rule in pain management.

148
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:04,778
Always err on the side of caution.

149
00:07:05,077 --> 00:07:05,798
He's in our care.

150
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:07,161
He says he's in pain.

151
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:07,961
Start a central line.

152
00:07:07,982 --> 00:07:08,843
His veins are shot.

153
00:07:17,632 --> 00:07:22,579
The surgery before was supposed to help, but it never felt right.

154
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:25,062
Probably would have been a good idea to quit smoking.

155
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:26,093
I did.

156
00:07:26,774 --> 00:07:27,995
Poor pack of day habit.

157
00:07:28,456 --> 00:07:29,098
Oh, it was hell.

158
00:07:29,278 --> 00:07:30,298
Here you go, Mrs. Drake.

159
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,480
Didn't do any damn good.

160
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,362
Really?

161
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:37,170
Because it looked, I mean, from the damage, we all thought you probably were still smoking.

162
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:38,151
Cold turkey.

163
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:40,875
Five years ago, what'd I get for my trouble?

164
00:07:41,576 --> 00:07:43,559
I still had to quit my job at the restaurant.

165
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:45,000
But even sitting, it hurt.

166
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:46,442
Here you go.

167
00:07:46,463 --> 00:07:47,283
Nobody believed me.

168
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:48,505
They all said it was in my head.

169
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:49,908
I've seen the films.

170
00:07:50,588 --> 00:07:51,550
It's not all in your head.

171
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,673
You're right about that.

172
00:07:53,713 --> 00:07:55,115
Hey, come here.

173
00:07:56,529 --> 00:07:58,271
You're too damn young to be a doctor.

174
00:07:58,752 --> 00:07:59,072
Hey.

175
00:08:01,216 --> 00:08:01,336
What?

176
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,437
I'm older than I look.

177
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:06,242
Do you think this is going to work this time?

178
00:08:06,262 --> 00:08:07,882
I think it's your best option.

179
00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:09,985
Great shooter, huh?

180
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:10,567
Yes, ma'am.

181
00:08:10,987 --> 00:08:25,204
I like that.

182
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,620
Hi, Mr. Patterson.

183
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:30,901
Hi.

184
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:32,484
Hemodynamic stable?

185
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:35,167
Yeah, MAP is stayed around 8, cardiac output at 5.

186
00:08:35,226 --> 00:08:37,408
That's good, Dr. Gray.

187
00:08:37,428 --> 00:08:38,671
That's fine, Mr. Patterson.

188
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,413
But it's not good.

189
00:08:40,972 --> 00:08:43,355
Well, heart surgery takes a lot out of the patient.

190
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:47,419
But we're monitoring your wife very carefully, and she should be fine.

191
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:55,087
Mr. Sturman, let's see about getting you out of here today.

192
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:56,710
How you feeling?

193
00:08:57,652 --> 00:09:01,437
Pretty OK, except I don't think I ever want to have a bowel obstruction again.

194
00:09:01,476 --> 00:09:02,077
Really?

195
00:09:02,118 --> 00:09:05,241
Wow, because we get people in here all the time requesting them.

196
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:08,105
So you're keeping non-clear fluids?

197
00:09:08,846 --> 00:09:11,529
And my all-time favorite question to ask a patient, have you pooped yet?

198
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,672
I'm not exactly sure.

199
00:09:13,692 --> 00:09:16,755
I think you probably know.

200
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:19,058
Past gas?

201
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,480
Yes.

202
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:21,743
Really, yes?

203
00:09:21,982 --> 00:09:23,524
Because if I bring in my handy lie detector.

204
00:09:23,644 --> 00:09:24,485
OK, no.

205
00:09:25,596 --> 00:09:28,059
I shouldn't try and lie, I know.

206
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:29,581
I went to medical school.

207
00:09:30,423 --> 00:09:31,163
You went to med school?

208
00:09:31,764 --> 00:09:33,605
Yeah, dropped out my last year of clinical.

209
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:38,951
Too many hours, and I was staring into the ice-cold eyes of divorce.

210
00:09:39,253 --> 00:09:39,452
Wow.

211
00:09:41,254 --> 00:09:41,355
Yeah.

212
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,639
I do research now, and I have a life, a family.

213
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,520
No offense.

214
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,982
You know, I mean... Oh, no, no.

215
00:09:48,423 --> 00:09:49,604
Um, that's okay.

216
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:52,447
I'm just one of those people who believe you can have both.

217
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,629
Maybe so.

218
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:56,850
But your first responsibility is always going to be your patient.

219
00:09:58,482 --> 00:09:58,725
Dr. Shepard?

220
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:26,090
Okay.

221
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:31,195
Okay.

222
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:52,455
You're always the same You're always the same

223
00:10:53,919 --> 00:11:06,279
Call this a spaghetti procedure.

224
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:16,456
We cut and deflate the boulet to facilitate gentle manipulation of Mrs. Drake's lung.

225
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:19,000
Dr. Bailey, you see that?

226
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:20,501
Sir?

227
00:11:23,164 --> 00:11:25,868
Oh, my ever-loving.

228
00:11:25,888 --> 00:11:27,490
We need to open her up.

229
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,491
I'm taking out the scope.

230
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:31,456
You heard him, people.

231
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:32,115
Let's move.

232
00:11:32,216 --> 00:11:32,716
Lights.

233
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,841
All right, let's get set up.

234
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,221
Tin blade.

235
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:37,703
Here you go.

236
00:11:37,724 --> 00:11:40,126
Tractors.

237
00:11:40,147 --> 00:11:40,386
Tractors.

238
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:43,831
That's a couple ready.

239
00:11:43,851 --> 00:11:45,774
Tunnel.

240
00:11:45,793 --> 00:11:47,676
Thank you.

241
00:11:47,696 --> 00:11:48,557
That rib spreader.

242
00:11:52,241 --> 00:11:52,783
Suction.

243
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:03,589
Is that a towel?

244
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,754
Where did that come from?

245
00:12:06,774 --> 00:12:09,758
Best guess, her surgery five years ago.

246
00:12:11,681 --> 00:12:22,355
Something careless this way comes.

247
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:22,996
A towel?

248
00:12:23,197 --> 00:12:23,778
Not good.

249
00:12:24,018 --> 00:12:26,662
She complained of pressure on her chest and nobody took her seriously.

250
00:12:26,741 --> 00:12:30,346
Not good for the patient, not good for the hospital, not good.

251
00:12:30,985 --> 00:12:32,147
Christina, hit the files.

252
00:12:32,226 --> 00:12:34,470
Find out everything you can about that initial operation.

253
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:35,331
Who was in that room?

254
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,893
Who was responsible for closing it?

255
00:12:36,913 --> 00:12:38,094
George, you stay with the patient.

256
00:12:38,335 --> 00:12:38,875
Keep her happy.

257
00:12:38,894 --> 00:12:39,797
She seems to like you.

258
00:12:40,216 --> 00:12:40,778
Right, OK.

259
00:12:40,798 --> 00:12:42,200
Um, how long do you think?

260
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,244
I mean, just technically, I'm off at 6.

261
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:46,885
Am I invited?

262
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:47,986
Excuse me?

263
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:50,591
Am I invited to the party?

264
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,033
Oh, well, yeah.

265
00:12:52,432 --> 00:12:54,054
Yes, yeah, of course.

266
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:59,962
What was I supposed to say?

267
00:13:00,836 --> 00:13:06,201
Okay, yeah, great.

268
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:08,783
All right, 14 cases.

269
00:13:08,803 --> 00:13:09,403
Uh, what kind?

270
00:13:09,423 --> 00:13:13,106
I don't know, maybe an assortment?

271
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:14,849
Microbrews, locals.

272
00:13:14,869 --> 00:13:17,711
Make sure they throw in some bar nuts.

273
00:13:18,051 --> 00:13:19,613
I'm ordering office supplies.

274
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:20,594
Oh, yeah, sure.

275
00:13:22,274 --> 00:13:24,177
Microbrews, local, and throw in some bar nuts.

276
00:13:24,797 --> 00:13:25,998
Seven o'clock would be better than five.

277
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:27,740
Uh, hey, any luck?

278
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:30,642
Hey, if I do, will you invite me to the party?

279
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,745
Yeah, great.

280
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:34,748
Okay, thanks.

281
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:35,993
Take it easy.

282
00:13:36,674 --> 00:13:37,840
Hey, Mr. Frost.

283
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,682
Where the hell have you been?

284
00:13:38,702 --> 00:13:39,745
We're gonna take care of you, all right?

285
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:40,548
Now just hang on.

286
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:41,975
Where the hell have you been?

287
00:13:42,436 --> 00:13:42,657
How's that?

288
00:13:46,147 --> 00:13:48,850
When I tell you to start a central line, you start a central line.

289
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,933
No judgment, no question.

290
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:53,356
The guy's been in seven hospitals in the last four months.

291
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:54,118
He's a major addict.

292
00:13:54,298 --> 00:13:56,081
The patient has a three lumbar fusion.

293
00:13:56,341 --> 00:13:57,062
He's a junkie.

294
00:13:57,222 --> 00:14:00,908
I mean, we shouldn't be giving him... Yeah, he's an addict, but his pain is real.

295
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:03,932
Now, lose the attitude, get down there, start a central line.

296
00:14:15,268 --> 00:14:15,427
Oh, God.

297
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:24,591
Told me I had a towel inside me.

298
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:26,352
Who told you that?

299
00:14:28,296 --> 00:14:29,258
A surgeon.

300
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:31,760
Owner, man.

301
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,224
Handsome.

302
00:14:33,244 --> 00:14:34,524
That's Dr. Weber.

303
00:14:34,905 --> 00:14:35,547
He's our chief.

304
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,731
Yeah.

305
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:44,480
There was a towel that somebody left last time.

306
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:45,442
Yes, ma'am.

307
00:14:46,383 --> 00:14:47,625
Who would do that?

308
00:14:51,048 --> 00:14:52,671
That doesn't seem right, does it?

309
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,881
No, ma'am, no.

310
00:14:59,004 --> 00:14:59,445
It doesn't.

311
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:05,398
That's walking around with a towel inside of me.

312
00:15:05,418 --> 00:15:06,980
How could that happen?

313
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,013
So what happens now?

314
00:15:49,052 --> 00:16:00,447
Now you keep this to yourself while we work it out.

315
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:02,071
Do this for me.

316
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:04,854
Dr. Stevens called the CCU.

317
00:16:04,874 --> 00:16:05,335
Dr. Stevens called CCU.

318
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:19,989
You sure?

319
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:22,331
Because you seem not okay.

320
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:22,711
I'm fine.

321
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:24,333
Cabbage was long.

322
00:16:24,354 --> 00:16:26,035
Well, let me take you out to dinner tonight.

323
00:16:26,056 --> 00:16:26,956
You can tell me all about it.

324
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:30,081
Real food, waiters, big chunks of carbs in a basket.

325
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,022
I can't.

326
00:16:31,682 --> 00:16:32,443
Forget about the party.

327
00:16:32,984 --> 00:16:33,825
You know about the party?

328
00:16:34,065 --> 00:16:35,067
Your friends will be at the party.

329
00:16:35,086 --> 00:16:36,508
You and I can be alone somewhere else.

330
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:38,070
How do you know about the party?

331
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:39,692
Thanks for not inviting me, by the way.

332
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:40,432
That felt good.

333
00:16:41,313 --> 00:16:41,494
Dinner.

334
00:16:41,553 --> 00:16:42,095
Think about dinner.

335
00:16:42,254 --> 00:16:42,936
Perfect opportunity.

336
00:16:44,918 --> 00:16:45,057
Well...

337
00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:49,355
What happened?

338
00:16:49,515 --> 00:16:52,357
Started having some swelling over her sternum, and then the blood just started gushing.

339
00:16:52,398 --> 00:16:53,678
Dr. Burke is on his way right now.

340
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,600
Is she dying?

341
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,162
Somebody get him out of here.

342
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,143
Keep applying pressure.

343
00:16:58,443 --> 00:16:58,543
Sir.

344
00:16:58,563 --> 00:16:59,804
Tyler, call 4-N-O-R.

345
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:00,525
What the hell happened?

346
00:17:00,546 --> 00:17:01,145
She got a protamine?

347
00:17:01,606 --> 00:17:04,869
For a protocol, no allergic, anaphylactic, or histamine responses.

348
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,051
Her last counts?

349
00:17:07,771 --> 00:17:11,155
PT, PTT, INR, platelet counts were all stable.

350
00:17:11,596 --> 00:17:12,777
Even her H and H were stable.

351
00:17:13,196 --> 00:17:13,877
What the hell went wrong?

352
00:17:13,897 --> 00:17:14,357
Let's move.

353
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:17,121
Hold on.

354
00:17:19,446 --> 00:17:20,748
I popped a glove.

355
00:17:20,768 --> 00:17:20,949
What?

356
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:25,252
In surgery, when I was holding it, I popped a glove with my fingernail.

357
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:28,016
I think I may have nicked her heart.

358
00:17:28,036 --> 00:17:28,655
Let's go, people.

359
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:39,346
What were you thinking about?

360
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:41,690
You had every opportunity to speak up before I closed her chest.

361
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:43,131
Every opportunity.

362
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:44,393
Suction.

363
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:44,893
I'm sorry.

364
00:17:44,913 --> 00:17:46,855
And then you go and confess in front of her husband?

365
00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:49,381
You don't even know if you were the cause.

366
00:17:49,421 --> 00:17:50,221
You have no idea.

367
00:17:50,261 --> 00:17:53,846
I'm sorry, Spencer.

368
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,529
There.

369
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:58,573
Loading.

370
00:17:58,593 --> 00:18:00,035
Over here.

371
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:00,595
There.

372
00:18:01,817 --> 00:18:02,557
Look at the wall, Rocha.

373
00:18:02,738 --> 00:18:04,820
It's a hell of a lot more than a fingernail.

374
00:18:05,882 --> 00:18:08,826
Her ventricular walls are weak.

375
00:18:09,328 --> 00:18:12,031
I just had a conversation with Mr. Patterson.

376
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,896
I want copies of his wife's chart in my office by 5.

377
00:18:16,116 --> 00:18:21,263
Tomorrow morning, the two of you are going to meet with me and legal, and you better damn well be able to explain what happened here.

378
00:18:23,747 --> 00:18:27,371
People poking holes in hearts, leaving towels in people.

379
00:18:27,391 --> 00:18:30,074
You're going to go back and talk to the husband.

380
00:18:30,994 --> 00:18:34,400
Review the history, apologize profusely.

381
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,242
Your ass is on the line here, Dr. Gray.

382
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,545
You got called before the chief?

383
00:18:43,865 --> 00:18:44,726
Tomorrow morning.

384
00:18:44,747 --> 00:18:46,849
I mean, I could get kicked out of the program.

385
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:48,852
I could, right?

386
00:18:48,952 --> 00:18:49,814
You're not getting kicked out.

387
00:18:50,153 --> 00:18:51,175
Patterson's just going to sue.

388
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:54,359
Patterson is not going to sue, and you're not getting kicked out.

389
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,343
What the hell were you thinking, telling Burke?

390
00:18:56,363 --> 00:18:57,183
That was so stupid.

391
00:18:57,244 --> 00:18:57,925
I told her not to.

392
00:19:00,048 --> 00:19:00,809
I got to take this.

393
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:03,834
Biggs, thank you.

394
00:19:03,953 --> 00:19:04,815
Very comforting.

395
00:19:04,835 --> 00:19:05,896
I'll watch your books.

396
00:19:07,243 --> 00:19:12,209
Okay, so the beer is coming at 7, and some of the floor nurses are bringing wine.

397
00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:13,191
Nurses?

398
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:14,432
You invited nurses?

399
00:19:15,772 --> 00:19:16,914
Did you clear this with Meredith?

400
00:19:17,295 --> 00:19:19,176
A few more people isn't gonna make a difference, okay?

401
00:19:19,237 --> 00:19:20,157
A party is a party.

402
00:19:20,499 --> 00:19:23,362
And the bigger the party, the less time for bad sex with the hockey player.

403
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:24,803
Would you stop saying that?

404
00:19:24,823 --> 00:19:25,324
Okay.

405
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:26,325
Hank and I have great sex.

406
00:19:26,786 --> 00:19:26,925
Mm-hmm.

407
00:19:26,945 --> 00:19:27,445
All the time.

408
00:19:27,807 --> 00:19:30,430
In fact, we'll probably have sex after the party or during the party.

409
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,711
As long as you clear it with Meredith...

410
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,532
You just need to realize that doctors can have fun.

411
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:39,317
We're not all workaholics with God complexes.

412
00:19:39,336 --> 00:19:41,680
We are workaholics with God complexes.

413
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:49,170
And the notary can be there at 6.30 too.

414
00:19:51,393 --> 00:19:54,237
And the home's physician will be there to attest to her mental competency.

415
00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:56,339
Okay.

416
00:19:57,381 --> 00:20:00,525
Is there anything else I need to bring beside my license?

417
00:20:01,446 --> 00:20:02,428
My checkbook.

418
00:20:02,914 --> 00:20:04,017
It's 6.30.

419
00:20:04,218 --> 00:20:04,798
I'll be there.

420
00:20:04,818 --> 00:20:07,284
I heard.

421
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:10,911
It's a notary thing, a thing to get notarized.

422
00:20:11,151 --> 00:20:12,574
You're talking about the heart thing.

423
00:20:12,594 --> 00:20:13,355
Do you want to talk about that?

424
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:15,941
We're adults.

425
00:20:17,403 --> 00:20:18,306
When did that happen?

426
00:20:21,592 --> 00:20:22,914
And how do we make it stop?

427
00:20:39,465 --> 00:20:42,450
Dr. Yang?

428
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,272
Dr. Burke?

429
00:20:45,393 --> 00:20:47,134
That bypass graph got a little complicated.

430
00:20:48,557 --> 00:21:02,354
There's nothing I couldn't handle.

431
00:21:02,374 --> 00:21:04,217
Good.

432
00:21:04,237 --> 00:21:04,376
Uh-huh.

433
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,038
Yeah.

434
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:06,199
Mm-hmm.

435
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:13,457
Listen, I'll call you back.

436
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:14,298
That was my lawyer.

437
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:16,560
He's advising me not to talk to you.

438
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,065
Mr. Patterson, I know that you're frustrated and angry.

439
00:21:20,085 --> 00:21:24,990
But I need, we need, some more information about your wife.

440
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,693
The walls of her heart are abnormally thin.

441
00:21:26,713 --> 00:21:28,174
Hey, don't blame this on my wife.

442
00:21:28,915 --> 00:21:30,538
I heard from your very mouth what happened.

443
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:31,038
I know.

444
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:32,742
But we can't treat her.

445
00:21:32,762 --> 00:21:34,810
No, she was in the best shape of her life.

446
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,954
You ask a cardiologist.

447
00:21:36,236 --> 00:21:37,460
She had lost 100 pounds.

448
00:21:37,621 --> 00:21:39,205
Don't you dare try to hang this on her.

449
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,413
Mr. Patterson, please.

450
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:42,176
What you talking?

451
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,634
You don't like me very much, do you?

452
00:22:08,555 --> 00:22:10,439
Well, Jerry, it's not you specifically.

453
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:13,042
It's just, uh, it's just people like you, that's all.

454
00:22:14,506 --> 00:22:16,368
Ah, feeling pretty good.

455
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,752
Paying's about a three.

456
00:22:19,034 --> 00:22:19,394
A three?

457
00:22:19,795 --> 00:22:21,377
That's excellent.

458
00:22:21,397 --> 00:22:26,046
Mr. Frost, I'm glad we could help you out, as well as County, Mercy West, Seattle Press.

459
00:22:26,066 --> 00:22:27,608
A lot of people have helped you out lately, Jerry.

460
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:29,291
I'm pleased we could do our part.

461
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,915
Who's on discharge today, Dr. Karev?

462
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:32,116
Izzy Stevens.

463
00:22:32,636 --> 00:22:34,640
Mr. Frost, Dr. Stevens is gonna come in to discharge you.

464
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:36,340
Well, well, well, you can't discharge me.

465
00:22:36,682 --> 00:22:37,142
I'm in pain.

466
00:22:37,162 --> 00:22:37,843
You were in pain.

467
00:22:37,883 --> 00:22:38,463
Now you're not.

468
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:42,788
Dr. Karev here is gonna recommend some wonderful treatment programs for you.

469
00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:43,588
Go home.

470
00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:45,852
Get some help.

471
00:22:45,872 --> 00:22:46,833
You can't just do that.

472
00:22:47,073 --> 00:22:48,114
You just did, my friend.

473
00:22:51,116 --> 00:22:51,538
Okay.

474
00:22:51,897 --> 00:22:52,538
Any luck yet?

475
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,621
Not, uh...

476
00:22:55,106 --> 00:22:57,049
Looks like you're gonna have to spend another night.

477
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,734
I hate to miss the party.

478
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:01,335
You gonna make it?

479
00:23:01,855 --> 00:23:04,640
Well, you are the last person on my list, so it's looking pretty good.

480
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,363
So, doctors have lives after all.

481
00:23:07,443 --> 00:23:08,064
Who'da thunk?

482
00:23:08,765 --> 00:23:11,288
Dr. Stevens, discharge my guy in 3.42.

483
00:23:15,173 --> 00:23:16,174
Don't look at me like that.

484
00:23:16,615 --> 00:23:19,398
It's not gonna take very long.

485
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,540
It's not.

486
00:23:25,886 --> 00:23:26,548
You paged me?

487
00:23:27,048 --> 00:23:27,709
I'm gonna be a while.

488
00:23:27,729 --> 00:23:29,210
Do you think you could get home to sign for the beer?

489
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:31,712
Why don't you have your boyfriend sign for it?

490
00:23:33,835 --> 00:23:36,376
You have a very annoying way of sneaking up on people.

491
00:23:37,077 --> 00:23:38,480
Maybe if you were a little less creepy.

492
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:39,641
I wouldn't come anyway.

493
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,362
I hate big parties.

494
00:23:41,382 --> 00:23:44,404
Is Meredith the only person in this hospital who doesn't know the size of this thing?

495
00:23:44,526 --> 00:23:45,306
I'm telling her.

496
00:23:45,906 --> 00:23:46,326
You can't.

497
00:23:46,386 --> 00:23:47,147
She's gone already.

498
00:23:47,248 --> 00:23:47,528
What?

499
00:23:47,548 --> 00:23:47,868
Already?

500
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:52,012
I think she had, um, excuse me, an errand to run.

501
00:23:53,343 --> 00:23:55,786
You don't think Mary's really going to mind about the party, right?

502
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:59,390
I want you to make it very clear to her that I had nothing to do with this party.

503
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,432
Nothing.

504
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:14,008
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

505
00:24:14,028 --> 00:24:14,648
It's the traffic.

506
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:15,390
It doesn't matter, dear.

507
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:16,611
OK.

508
00:24:16,631 --> 00:24:17,932
Don't tell me the notary didn't show.

509
00:24:18,012 --> 00:24:18,713
Oh, everybody's here.

510
00:24:18,773 --> 00:24:20,615
It's just your mother isn't.

511
00:24:23,109 --> 00:24:23,490
Mom?

512
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:25,835
Mom?

513
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:26,757
What do you people want from me?

514
00:24:27,597 --> 00:24:29,260
We need you to sign the lawyer's papers.

515
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,305
I have a cranial reconstruction in half an hour.

516
00:24:31,325 --> 00:24:31,905
I need to go.

517
00:24:31,925 --> 00:24:33,128
OK, Mom.

518
00:24:33,288 --> 00:24:33,990
We're all here.

519
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,092
We have a notary.

520
00:24:35,712 --> 00:24:36,634
I need you to focus.

521
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,759
And I need you to sign these papers.

522
00:24:40,762 --> 00:24:42,486
Mom, look at me.

523
00:24:44,355 --> 00:24:45,557
It's an emergency surgery.

524
00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:46,779
I don't have time for this.

525
00:24:47,141 --> 00:24:48,983
She can't sign anything now.

526
00:24:49,003 --> 00:24:49,724
She's sundowning.

527
00:24:49,744 --> 00:24:51,288
We should have done this earlier in the day.

528
00:24:51,428 --> 00:24:53,030
I couldn't come earlier in the day.

529
00:24:53,372 --> 00:24:56,317
I have a job and a life, and I'm here now.

530
00:24:56,557 --> 00:24:59,182
Well, you're going to have to come back tomorrow when she's lucid.

531
00:24:59,561 --> 00:25:02,126
You know, why did she put this off for so long?

532
00:25:02,326 --> 00:25:03,429
And why did you let her?

533
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,932
Doesn't it strike you as slightly irresponsible?

534
00:25:05,953 --> 00:25:08,557
I mean, what the hell is wrong with you people?

535
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:28,200
Get it to you first.

536
00:26:31,528 --> 00:26:33,332
Izzy, I'm gonna kill you.

537
00:26:41,047 --> 00:26:49,122
You could touch that, but I'd have to kill you.

538
00:26:49,142 --> 00:26:50,263
So if I could tell a thing?

539
00:26:50,545 --> 00:26:53,089
It's been taken care of.

540
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:53,250
Okay.

541
00:26:54,192 --> 00:26:56,355
You don't need to concern yourself with it.

542
00:26:57,037 --> 00:26:57,858
So what's going to happen?

543
00:26:58,138 --> 00:27:00,462
We're not going to talk about it anymore is what's going to happen.

544
00:27:00,502 --> 00:27:00,983
We clear?

545
00:27:02,006 --> 00:27:04,009
You had too much alcohol to understand me.

546
00:27:05,112 --> 00:27:06,134
You're very clear.

547
00:27:06,153 --> 00:27:06,473
Good.

548
00:27:08,017 --> 00:27:09,078
You have any bourbon?

549
00:27:17,242 --> 00:27:19,046
You can't discharge a man in pain.

550
00:27:19,066 --> 00:27:20,086
Ow, you're hurting me.

551
00:27:20,407 --> 00:27:21,930
You're the one who's making it more difficult.

552
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:23,752
Stop resisting.

553
00:27:23,772 --> 00:27:25,255
Just give me the edidemarol.

554
00:27:26,036 --> 00:27:26,896
Just give me the edidemarol.

555
00:27:27,018 --> 00:27:27,317
Come on.

556
00:27:27,337 --> 00:27:28,640
Mr. Frost, you have to.

557
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,300
I'm not leaving.

558
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,323
I'm not leaving.

559
00:27:30,363 --> 00:27:32,306
No, no, no.

560
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:33,047
Don't go.

561
00:27:33,106 --> 00:27:35,990
Wait, wait, wait.

562
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:36,392
Stop.

563
00:27:39,435 --> 00:27:39,656
Stop.

564
00:27:39,676 --> 00:27:40,196
Stop.

565
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:41,779
Jerry.

566
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:42,840
Jerry.

567
00:27:43,021 --> 00:27:43,942
Concussion?

568
00:27:47,617 --> 00:27:48,479
He's blown his left pupil.

569
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:49,299
Paige Shepherd.

570
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,500
We gotta get him down to CT.

571
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:54,685
That was one hard fall.

572
00:27:55,266 --> 00:27:55,946
What do you see?

573
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:01,692
Subdural bleed.

574
00:28:02,374 --> 00:28:03,154
With midline shift.

575
00:28:03,736 --> 00:28:06,077
We have to evacuate this now.

576
00:28:06,097 --> 00:28:08,540
Anywhere else you have to be, Dr. Stevens, or are you in?

577
00:28:09,761 --> 00:28:11,203
Brain surgery?

578
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:11,364
Mm-hmm.

579
00:28:11,384 --> 00:28:12,424
Are you kidding me?

580
00:28:12,444 --> 00:28:13,086
That's what I thought.

581
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:31,174
Rosemary, heaven restores you in life.

582
00:28:31,195 --> 00:28:38,481
You're coming with me.

583
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:38,781
Here you go.

584
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,183
Where is Izzy?

585
00:28:40,203 --> 00:28:43,527
She didn't clear it with you.

586
00:28:43,547 --> 00:28:47,589
This was supposed to be a meet the boyfriend, get together little thingy.

587
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:49,372
Izzy has a lot of friends.

588
00:28:49,672 --> 00:28:50,633
Excuse me.

589
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,153
Izzy doesn't know this many people!

590
00:28:53,173 --> 00:28:55,055
I told her to clear it with you!

591
00:28:55,075 --> 00:28:56,416
I can't handle this!

592
00:28:57,018 --> 00:28:58,199
You want me to kick everyone out?

593
00:28:59,221 --> 00:29:04,227
I'm gonna kick everyone out!

594
00:29:04,307 --> 00:29:08,834
Baby, you made it!

595
00:29:08,854 --> 00:29:10,615
Screw it.

596
00:29:10,635 --> 00:29:10,997
Hold this.

597
00:29:12,778 --> 00:29:13,599
And give me this.

598
00:29:18,877 --> 00:29:27,173
George!

599
00:29:27,193 --> 00:29:27,576
Georgie, come here!

600
00:29:27,596 --> 00:29:27,938
Come on, Georgie!

601
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:28,318
George, come here!

602
00:29:28,338 --> 00:29:28,500
Come on!

603
00:29:54,518 --> 00:29:54,898
See it?

604
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,221
Yeah, it's hard to miss.

605
00:29:57,284 --> 00:29:58,647
A little more than he bargained for.

606
00:29:58,968 --> 00:29:59,549
Maybe he's lucky.

607
00:29:59,869 --> 00:30:01,273
Maybe this is his way out of the hole.

608
00:30:02,195 --> 00:30:02,717
The hole?

609
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:04,000
Interesting expression.

610
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:07,347
My father was into smack pretty heavy.

611
00:30:07,448 --> 00:30:08,088
He was a musician.

612
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,193
He was tolerated in his line of work.

613
00:30:10,714 --> 00:30:11,817
Not good for the family at home.

614
00:30:20,489 --> 00:30:22,792
Why do we want to be surgeons anyway?

615
00:30:22,873 --> 00:30:24,654
Surgery's a very serious business.

616
00:30:26,718 --> 00:30:27,440
Full house.

617
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:30,144
Right on flash.

618
00:30:30,744 --> 00:30:31,425
Get naked.

619
00:30:31,885 --> 00:30:33,868
Baby boy.

620
00:30:33,888 --> 00:30:34,470
Sexy.

621
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:35,412
Surgery's stupid.

622
00:30:36,073 --> 00:30:36,313
You're sexy.

623
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:37,054
It's stupid.

624
00:30:37,595 --> 00:30:38,056
It's stupid.

625
00:30:38,076 --> 00:30:38,415
Give me that.

626
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:39,577
You're drunk.

627
00:30:39,597 --> 00:30:40,459
I'm not driving.

628
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:41,721
I'm not on call.

629
00:30:42,082 --> 00:30:43,063
I'm in my own house.

630
00:30:43,503 --> 00:30:44,566
My life is crap.

631
00:30:45,446 --> 00:30:48,791
And it's my party, and I'll get drunk if I want to.

632
00:30:49,108 --> 00:30:51,916
Is, um, is he Stevens?

633
00:30:51,936 --> 00:30:53,330
Oh, you must be Hank.

634
00:30:55,707 --> 00:30:58,431
He's very large and hockey-like.

635
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:01,334
No, Izzy's not here right now.

636
00:31:01,354 --> 00:31:02,695
Okay.

637
00:31:02,715 --> 00:31:07,402
You and Izzy will give birth to very tall blonde girls.

638
00:31:07,422 --> 00:31:08,182
Kind of like Barbies.

639
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:09,365
Izzy said she was gonna be at home.

640
00:31:09,424 --> 00:31:10,846
She didn't say there was gonna be a party.

641
00:31:11,126 --> 00:31:12,689
Which pisses both of us off.

642
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,551
Would you like some tequila?

643
00:31:14,852 --> 00:31:15,292
It helps.

644
00:31:15,472 --> 00:31:16,614
When do you think she's gonna get here?

645
00:31:16,673 --> 00:31:17,434
Don't know.

646
00:31:18,237 --> 00:31:19,898
But we're low on ice, Hank.

647
00:31:20,098 --> 00:31:20,700
I'm serious.

648
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:21,681
So am I.

649
00:31:23,077 --> 00:31:24,760
We're interns, Hank.

650
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,862
The hospital owns us.

651
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:26,983
It's what we do.

652
00:31:30,209 --> 00:31:30,368
Bye.

653
00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:32,011
Nice to meet you.

654
00:31:32,031 --> 00:31:34,355
Can you guys see him through recovery?

655
00:31:34,736 --> 00:31:35,497
Yeah, I'll take it.

656
00:31:35,517 --> 00:31:35,998
No, I can do it.

657
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:38,060
It's OK, Seamans.

658
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,603
No, he's my patient now, too.

659
00:31:39,623 --> 00:31:40,104
No, I got it.

660
00:31:40,124 --> 00:31:41,045
See your hockey player.

661
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:41,465
I'm serious.

662
00:31:43,008 --> 00:31:44,730
Yeah, OK.

663
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,010
I guess.

664
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:45,692
Thanks, Alex.

665
00:31:46,814 --> 00:31:47,414
No problem.

666
00:32:01,942 --> 00:32:03,944
Hey.

667
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:04,045
Hey.

668
00:32:04,065 --> 00:32:05,086
What are you doing here?

669
00:32:10,815 --> 00:32:13,479
I'm sorry I didn't have a chance to call.

670
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:15,602
My patient needed brain surgery.

671
00:32:15,622 --> 00:32:17,064
Like we were inside his brain.

672
00:32:17,084 --> 00:32:17,846
How cool is that?

673
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:22,952
Oh, my God.

674
00:32:22,972 --> 00:32:25,497
There's a party at your house.

675
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:27,078
Yeah, did you get a chance to hang out?

676
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,961
Why don't you meet some of the people I work with?

677
00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:32,093
I don't care about the people you work with.

678
00:32:32,113 --> 00:32:32,873
I just want to see you.

679
00:32:34,654 --> 00:32:34,715
Hm.

680
00:32:34,736 --> 00:32:37,858
Well, you didn't mind meeting the people I worked with when they were models.

681
00:32:37,878 --> 00:32:41,723
Yeah, well, when they were models, you actually showed up to your own parties.

682
00:32:43,705 --> 00:32:44,006
Yeah.

683
00:32:48,991 --> 00:32:51,674
This is my life now, Hank.

684
00:32:51,694 --> 00:32:52,855
I work 100-hour weeks.

685
00:32:53,737 --> 00:32:57,902
I can't always show up to my own parties on time, and my patients have to come first.

686
00:32:58,102 --> 00:33:03,028
Yeah, I just flew across the entire country, and there's a hundred people at your house.

687
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:04,810
Yeah, a hundred people will understand what I do all day.

688
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:07,094
I shouldn't have to apologize for that.

689
00:33:07,934 --> 00:33:16,846
No, you shouldn't.

690
00:33:16,865 --> 00:33:19,650
Look, let's just go by the party for a little while.

691
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:25,317
You'll really like everyone once you get a chance to know them.

692
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,218
Let's just go.

693
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:31,463
Hank, come on.

694
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:36,550
I'll call you.

695
00:33:38,273 --> 00:33:50,990
In a place I dream about where the sun never goes out and the sky is deep and blue, won't you take me there with you?

696
00:33:56,692 --> 00:34:02,127
Shade our skin like the sun's shining

697
00:34:28,788 --> 00:34:30,590
You know, in some states you get arrested for that.

698
00:34:44,614 --> 00:34:46,257
So you blew me off for a bottle of tequila.

699
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:48,001
Tequila's no good for you.

700
00:34:48,621 --> 00:34:50,144
Doesn't call, doesn't write.

701
00:34:50,164 --> 00:34:52,027
It's not nearly as much fun to wake up to.

702
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:14,463
Take me for a ride, Derek.

703
00:35:14,483 --> 00:35:17,608
You know, it sounds like the party's winding down.

704
00:35:17,628 --> 00:35:17,807
Yeah.

705
00:35:17,827 --> 00:35:18,329
Listen to me.

706
00:35:18,528 --> 00:35:18,909
What?

707
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,731
You should probably sneak inside, though.

708
00:35:22,112 --> 00:35:24,117
We did enough sneaking for the night.

709
00:35:24,137 --> 00:35:26,000
It was good sneaking, but enough sneaking.

710
00:35:26,061 --> 00:35:27,282
Yeah, I say we're pretty good sneakers.

711
00:35:33,614 --> 00:35:35,639
You mind moving this tail wagon?

712
00:35:35,659 --> 00:35:36,681
You're blocking me in.

713
00:35:40,527 --> 00:35:42,552
Apparently not good enough.

714
00:36:11,286 --> 00:36:12,588
When's your meeting with the chief?

715
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:15,791
In an hour.

716
00:36:21,356 --> 00:36:22,737
Holy mother of destruction.

717
00:36:23,697 --> 00:36:26,679
You missed Dr. Palooza.

718
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:28,201
Apparently, you didn't.

719
00:36:29,242 --> 00:36:31,184
I should probably never speak to you again.

720
00:36:31,204 --> 00:36:33,806
I'm so sorry, Meredith.

721
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:37,750
I had no idea it was going to get so.

722
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:37,949
It's OK.

723
00:36:38,971 --> 00:36:40,652
Really, I don't care.

724
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,492
What would I be doing anyway?

725
00:36:42,914 --> 00:36:44,856
Preparing for your career-altering meeting.

726
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:46,518
Sorry.

727
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:48,101
That heart wall shouldn't have torn.

728
00:36:48,121 --> 00:36:50,405
Anything in the patient's history?

729
00:36:51,847 --> 00:36:54,130
Husband said she was in the best shape of her life.

730
00:36:55,092 --> 00:36:56,755
She lost 100 pounds last year.

731
00:36:56,775 --> 00:36:59,057
100 pounds in a year?

732
00:36:59,077 --> 00:37:00,440
How's her muscle mass?

733
00:37:04,485 --> 00:37:05,887
Do you even know whose that was?

734
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,331
I'm hoping it was yours.

735
00:37:09,373 --> 00:37:09,693
No.

736
00:37:13,706 --> 00:37:14,268
What do you think?

737
00:37:15,974 --> 00:37:20,168
50 says Meredith gets tossed out on her ass, and Burke walks away clean.

738
00:37:20,188 --> 00:37:21,472
Please be nice to her.

739
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:28,077
So I have done a lot of research on this, and Dr. Burke has been kind enough to help me.

740
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:32,224
And I understand my responsibility and what I've done wrong here.

741
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:36,989
However, I do think the patient's history is significant in this case.

742
00:37:37,331 --> 00:37:41,016
She still weighs 200 pounds, which is why no one even noticed it.

743
00:37:41,496 --> 00:37:44,641
But with that kind of a weight drop, it doesn't matter how much you weigh.

744
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,322
Technically, you're anorexic.

745
00:37:46,342 --> 00:37:49,067
So along with all that fat, she was losing muscle, heart muscle.

746
00:37:49,447 --> 00:37:52,692
That certainly could be the reason for a small poke to become a large tear.

747
00:37:52,672 --> 00:37:54,494
That still doesn't change the fact, though.

748
00:37:54,554 --> 00:37:57,715
The small poke wasn't reported by Dr. Gray at the time of the occurrence.

749
00:37:58,077 --> 00:37:59,277
And if I could change that?

750
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:00,237
And you can't.

751
00:38:00,858 --> 00:38:04,061
You've left yourself and the hospital open to a tremendous amount of liability.

752
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:04,501
Oh, no, no.

753
00:38:04,521 --> 00:38:06,322
Not if the patient's weight loss caused the problem.

754
00:38:06,342 --> 00:38:06,784
I'm sorry.

755
00:38:06,903 --> 00:38:08,284
I have no choice here other than to rectify.

756
00:38:08,304 --> 00:38:09,226
I've spoken to the husband.

757
00:38:09,525 --> 00:38:15,010
And I believe that as long as his wife remains stable, I can't take your beliefs to the bank, Dr. Burke.

758
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,911
Dr. Gray made a huge error.

759
00:38:16,952 --> 00:38:17,713
And she reported it.

760
00:38:17,873 --> 00:38:18,454
Too late.

761
00:38:18,893 --> 00:38:20,394
And in front of the patient's husband.

762
00:38:20,815 --> 00:38:21,576
But she reported it.

763
00:38:21,655 --> 00:38:22,577
She spoke up.

764
00:38:26,623 --> 00:38:33,570
Five years ago, as a CT fellow, I had a nagging feeling that I didn't check the body cavity of a lung patient closely enough before I closed.

765
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:36,735
The patient seemed fine post-op, and I was in a hurry.

766
00:38:39,097 --> 00:38:43,282
And yesterday, you and Dr. Bailey pulled a towel out from under that patient's lung.

767
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:46,846
Why didn't I report it at an appropriate time?

768
00:38:46,905 --> 00:38:54,454
Maybe because I was afraid that I would be called into a meeting where some hospital lawyer's fear of liability could end my career.

769
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,271
Even great doctors make mistakes.

770
00:38:57,552 --> 00:39:02,260
And when we do, we've got to have a chance to be able to speak up without fear of retribution.

771
00:39:03,663 --> 00:39:04,423
Or everyone suffers.

772
00:39:05,545 --> 00:39:06,586
Dr. Gray spoke up.

773
00:39:19,347 --> 00:39:20,329
Responsibility.

774
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,432
It really does suck.

775
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,947
Meredith, you OK?

776
00:39:29,088 --> 00:39:30,469
Yeah, one month probation.

777
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:31,391
Good.

778
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:31,773
That's good.

779
00:39:31,793 --> 00:39:32,012
Yeah.

780
00:39:32,673 --> 00:39:34,438
Burke saved my ass in there.

781
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:35,960
Don't you all have something better to do?

782
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:36,922
Come on, people, move.

783
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:41,592
He was always going to tell them about the towel.

784
00:39:42,052 --> 00:39:43,454
Just wanted to wait for the right time.

785
00:39:44,076 --> 00:39:45,940
Information is power.

786
00:40:08,701 --> 00:40:27,619
Unfortunately, once you get past the age of braces and training bras, responsibility doesn't go away.

787
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:29,420
Jerry, this is Sloan.

788
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:36,887
She's here to talk to you, if you want, about options for rehab.

789
00:40:36,907 --> 00:40:38,268
It can't be avoided.

790
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:47,340
Mrs. Drake, I cannot begin to tell you how truly sorry I am.

791
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:53,208
Either someone makes us face it, or we suffer the consequences.

792
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:55,952
Easy.

793
00:40:55,972 --> 00:41:05,144
I did it.

794
00:41:05,164 --> 00:41:07,248
I pooped.

795
00:41:07,387 --> 00:41:09,471
All right.

796
00:41:13,788 --> 00:41:31,514
Missed your party?

797
00:41:31,534 --> 00:41:31,894
Life as a surgeon.

798
00:41:31,914 --> 00:41:32,516
And loving every minute of it.

799
00:41:32,536 --> 00:41:33,257
You watch TV, and pass me the phone.

800
00:41:33,277 --> 00:41:33,717
I need a conversation.

801
00:41:33,737 --> 00:41:34,559
You're feeling down, just like this town.

802
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:35,019
And your eyes say, oh.

803
00:41:37,378 --> 00:41:41,364
And still, adulthood has its perks.

804
00:41:41,784 --> 00:41:44,206
Thanks for the coffee.

805
00:41:44,226 --> 00:41:51,315
The kind who'd take her clothes off and sit in a room full of frozen faces.

806
00:41:54,759 --> 00:42:00,724
I heard she went to find God in the Indian subcontinent.

807
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:04,769
It's mad she had to go so far.

808
00:42:06,353 --> 00:42:11,023
I mean the shoes, the sex, the no parents anywhere telling you what to do.

809
00:42:15,572 --> 00:42:26,235
That's pretty damn good.
