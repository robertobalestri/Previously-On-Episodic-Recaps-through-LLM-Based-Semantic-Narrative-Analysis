1
00:00:02,863 --> 00:00:06,848
Remember when you were a kid, and your biggest worry was,

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,639
like, if you'd get a bike for your birthday

3
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:12,429
or if you'd get to eat cookies for breakfast?

4
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:16,520
Being an adult -- totally overrated.

5
00:00:18,804 --> 00:00:22,794
I mean, seriously, don't be fooled by all the hot shoes and the great sex

6
00:00:22,854 --> 00:00:25,327
and the no parents anywhere telling you what to do.

7
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:29,356
Adulthood is responsibility.

8
00:00:29,874 --> 00:00:32,486
The lawyer has been managing her estate with a limited power of attorney,

9
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:34,681
but your mother's alzheimer's is advancing.

10
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:36,842
So, while she's still lucid enough to consent,

11
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,837
she needs to sign everything over to you.

12
00:00:40,919 --> 00:00:41,735
Me?

13
00:00:44,926 --> 00:00:48,086
Responsibility -- it really does suck.

14
00:00:48,153 --> 00:00:50,872
Look, I haven't slept in 48 hours.

15
00:00:50,949 --> 00:00:53,827
I'm getting my first shot at heart surgery this morning.

16
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:55,280
I'm missing rounds.

17
00:00:55,413 --> 00:00:59,612
Are you sure there isn't anybody here, or the attorney...?

18
00:00:59,846 --> 00:01:02,536
I mean, do I really have to be the one to handle this?

19
00:01:02,632 --> 00:01:05,699
We're talking about her estate, finances, medical care.

20
00:01:05,746 --> 00:01:07,885
You really want to leave her life in someone else's hands?

21
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:08,992
She's your mother.

22
00:01:10,686 --> 00:01:12,857
Really, really sucks.

23
00:01:14,384 --> 00:01:17,414
Adults have to be places and do things

24
00:01:17,455 --> 00:01:20,497
and earn a living and pay the rent.

25
00:01:20,741 --> 00:01:22,493
And if you're training to be a surgeon,

26
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,915
holding a human heart in your hands --

27
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,675
Hello! Talk about responsibility!

28
00:01:32,995 --> 00:01:34,228
What was that, Dr. Grey?

29
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:35,877
Sorry, it slipped.

30
00:01:35,954 --> 00:01:36,767
My hands...

31
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,627
It's okay. I'm done.

32
00:01:39,194 --> 00:01:41,064
You can release Mrs. Patterson's heart now,

33
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:42,650
very gently.

34
00:01:46,604 --> 00:01:47,473
All right.

35
00:01:48,172 --> 00:01:49,342
Let's warm her up.

36
00:01:49,886 --> 00:01:50,870
Get her off bypass.

37
00:01:50,925 --> 00:01:54,227
Kind of makes bikes and cookies look really, really good, doesn't it?

38
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:56,129
I wish I could hold a heart.

39
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:57,596
A monkey could hold a heart.

40
00:01:58,273 --> 00:01:59,936
You're mad Burke didn't ask you.

41
00:02:00,007 --> 00:02:02,339
George, I need more ice and chips.

42
00:02:02,405 --> 00:02:03,392
Who did you invite?

43
00:02:03,471 --> 00:02:07,268
We said the list was jocks only -- surgery, trauma, plastics.

44
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,098
Who else?

45
00:02:08,297 --> 00:02:09,603
Some people from peds.

46
00:02:10,273 --> 00:02:12,619
You invited the preschoolers to Meredith's house.

47
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,076
Next thing, you'll say that you invited the shrinks.

48
00:02:16,464 --> 00:02:18,047
She invited mental defects.

49
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,290
This party is D.O.A.

50
00:02:19,357 --> 00:02:23,094
Meredith thinks this is going to be a small, meet-your-boyfriend cocktail thing.

51
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,150
Did you clear this with her?

52
00:02:24,214 --> 00:02:25,112
No, but I will.

53
00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:27,375
I promise.

54
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:31,066
Why are you wasting the only weekend your boyfriend is in town on a big party?

55
00:02:31,369 --> 00:02:32,479
Is he bad in bed?

56
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,198
No. I just want him to meet some of my friends.

57
00:02:36,263 --> 00:02:39,530
Right. 60 geeks in scrubs are your friends.

58
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,548
Bad sex -- sucks for you.

59
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,536
I heard there's a party tonight. At Meredith's house.

60
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,625
- A party? 
- Uh, news to me.

61
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:48,418
No party.

62
00:02:48,499 --> 00:02:49,693
We losing her or what?

63
00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:52,222
- Are the grafts...?
- They're open.

64
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:55,386
- Temperature?
- She's at 96 and rising.

65
00:02:55,464 --> 00:02:56,989
She should be doing this on her own.

66
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:01,914
That's her falling.

67
00:03:03,231 --> 00:03:04,480
Continue the progressions.

68
00:03:07,347 --> 00:03:08,689
Come on, Mrs. Patterson.

69
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,685
- Paddles.
- Sets are below 90.

70
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:11,730
Charge.

71
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:13,767
10 joules.

72
00:03:14,284 --> 00:03:15,043
Clear.

73
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,601
Come on, Mrs. Patterson.

74
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:20,782
- Give me 20.
- Charge.

75
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:22,424
There. We have rhythm.

76
00:03:24,393 --> 00:03:25,728
Reluctant heart.

77
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,505
All right.

78
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:29,251
Let's close.

79
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,581
Keep an eye on her.

80
00:03:31,185 --> 00:03:32,173
Good work, everyone.

81
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:36,049
The scariest part about responsibility?

82
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:41,856
When you screw up and let it slip right through your fingers.

83
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,950
Hey, I heard you did a cabg with Burke.

84
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:48,103
Did you get to hold the heart?

85
00:03:48,335 --> 00:03:49,224
Yeah.

86
00:03:49,351 --> 00:03:52,137
It's an amazing feeling. You never forget the first time.

87
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,827
It was pretty great just to watch.

88
00:03:54,303 --> 00:03:56,089
Vicarious thrills, you know?

89
00:03:56,546 --> 00:03:57,349
Yeah.

90
00:04:03,985 --> 00:04:04,814
See you later.

91
00:04:05,188 --> 00:04:05,957
Bye.

92
00:04:17,073 --> 00:04:22,003
I think maybe I did something to the heart when I was holding it.

93
00:04:22,904 --> 00:04:25,509
I nodded off a little, squeezed it.

94
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:27,752
Oh, please.

95
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:29,287
The heart's a tough muscle.

96
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,423
It can take a squeeze or two.

97
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:35,601
My fingernail popped a glove, cut straight through.

98
00:04:36,462 --> 00:04:39,206
George, what if I punctured Mrs. Patterson's heart?

99
00:04:41,869 --> 00:04:44,070
If you had punctured it,

100
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:47,116
you would have known when they reperfused.

101
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:49,103
They got her heart beating. The woman's okay.

102
00:04:50,154 --> 00:04:52,354
- So, I shouldn't tell Burke?
- Tell him what?

103
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,248
You  know, um...

104
00:04:55,457 --> 00:04:57,432
nothing happened. The woman's okay, right?

105
00:04:59,025 --> 00:05:00,033
She's  okay.

106
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,560
She's fine.

107
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,694
She's  fine.

108
00:05:35,862 --> 00:05:36,991
What do you see, George?

109
00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:40,027
Hyperinflated lungs -- cloudy with bullae.

110
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:42,090
Seriously diminished capacity.

111
00:05:42,152 --> 00:05:44,138
She must be having trouble breathing.

112
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:45,976
Course of action?

113
00:05:46,048 --> 00:05:49,571
A bullectomy procedure. Remove the bullae. Reduce the pressure.

114
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:51,952
It says here we operated on her back in '99.

115
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:55,157
So Mrs. Drake has been through this before, but talk her through it anyway.

116
00:05:55,234 --> 00:05:57,547
And resist the anti-smoking lectures.

117
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,294
She feels bad enough already.

118
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:06,432
So, do you think, if they put a picture of these in a pack of cigarettes, people would stop smoking?

119
00:06:10,271 --> 00:06:11,935
How long has your back been hurting you?

120
00:06:12,425 --> 00:06:13,840
It's chronic.

121
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,078
Means I have it all the time.

122
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:17,506
I know what "chronic" means.

123
00:06:17,642 --> 00:06:18,759
What kind of pain are you having?

124
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:19,785
Oh, man, the pain's bad.

125
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,680
It's like a thousand samurai warriors stabbing their swords into my spine.

126
00:06:23,908 --> 00:06:26,113
I'm allergic to aspirin, most nsaids.

127
00:06:26,173 --> 00:06:27,434
So, maybe we'll start you on morphine.

128
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,368
No. The only things that will work are, uh,

129
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:34,689
demerol or dilaudid. A ton of dilaudid -- that will set me straight.

130
00:06:35,097 --> 00:06:37,209
The standard starting dose is two.

131
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,471
Did you see that tom cruise samurai movie, hmm?

132
00:06:39,635 --> 00:06:40,997
Pow! Pow! Pow!

133
00:06:42,128 --> 00:06:44,882
Exaggerated and overly specific description of his pain.

134
00:06:44,975 --> 00:06:46,184
A self-prescription.

135
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,016
"Pow! Pow! Pow!"?

136
00:06:48,118 --> 00:06:49,353
He's a dilaudid junkie.

137
00:06:49,424 --> 00:06:50,275
So what do you do?

138
00:06:50,351 --> 00:06:53,479
Check the database for history, refer to a program, and discharge.

139
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:54,770
After you give him something.

140
00:06:55,323 --> 00:06:56,720
That's exactly what he wants.

141
00:06:56,788 --> 00:06:59,741
Junlie or not, you still have to treat his pain as if it were real.

142
00:06:59,946 --> 00:07:00,549
Why?

143
00:07:00,617 --> 00:07:03,714
The first rule in pain management -- always ERR on the side of caution.

144
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,657
He's in our care. He says he's in pain.

145
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:07,965
Start a central line. His veins are shot.

146
00:07:16,326 --> 00:07:18,706
The surgery before was supposed to help.

147
00:07:19,434 --> 00:07:21,666
But it never felt right.

148
00:07:21,865 --> 00:07:23,933
Probably would have been a good idea to quit smoking.

149
00:07:24,032 --> 00:07:25,178
I did!

150
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:26,955
Four-pack-a-day habit.

151
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:27,963
It was hell.

152
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,064
Here you go, Mrs. Drake.

153
00:07:29,135 --> 00:07:30,396
Didn't do any good.

154
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:32,171
Really? Because it looked...

155
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,160
I mean, from the damage, we all thought you probably were still smoking.

156
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,887
Cold turkey, five years ago, and what did I get for my trouble?

157
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,264
I still had to quit my job at the restaurant.

158
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,913
But even sitting, it hurt.

159
00:07:44,051 --> 00:07:44,946
Here you go.

160
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,537
Nobody believed me. They all said it was in my head.

161
00:07:47,609 --> 00:07:48,726
I've seen the films.

162
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:50,547
It's not all in your head.

163
00:07:51,332 --> 00:07:52,692
You're right about that.

164
00:07:53,179 --> 00:07:54,004
Hey, come here.

165
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:57,295
You're too damn young to be a doctor.

166
00:07:57,403 --> 00:07:58,888
- Hey.
- What?

167
00:07:59,825 --> 00:08:01,455
I'm older than I look.

168
00:08:02,974 --> 00:08:05,371
Do you think this is going to work this time?

169
00:08:05,503 --> 00:08:06,818
I think it's your best option.

170
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:08,672
Straight shooter, huh?

171
00:08:08,745 --> 00:08:09,548
Yes, ma'am.

172
00:08:09,634 --> 00:08:10,807
I like that.

173
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:28,523
Hi, Mr. Patterson.

174
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:29,916
Hi.

175
00:08:30,115 --> 00:08:31,462
Hemodynamics stable?

176
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:34,523
Yeah, map has stayed around 80. Cardiac output at 5.

177
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:37,709
- That's good, Dr. Grey?
- That's fine, Mr. Patterson.

178
00:08:37,955 --> 00:08:39,408
But it's not good.

179
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:42,009
Well, heart surgery takes a lot out of the patient,

180
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:44,835
but we're monitoring your wife very carefully,

181
00:08:45,077 --> 00:08:46,495
and she should be fine.

182
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:54,067
Mr. Sterman, let's see about getting you out of here today.

183
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,434
How are you feeling?

184
00:08:55,967 --> 00:09:00,389
Pretty okay, except I don't think I ever want to have a bowel obstruction again.

185
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:01,154
Really?

186
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,610
We get people in here all the time requesting one.

187
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:07,086
So, you keeping down clear fluids?

188
00:09:07,394 --> 00:09:10,594
And my all-time favorite question -- have you pooped yet?

189
00:09:10,702 --> 00:09:12,755
I'm not exactly sure.

190
00:09:13,282 --> 00:09:15,822
I think you'd probably know.

191
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,110
Passed gas?

192
00:09:18,827 --> 00:09:19,641
Yes.

193
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:22,365
Really yes? Because if I bring in my handy lie detector...

194
00:09:22,463 --> 00:09:23,405
Okay, no.

195
00:09:24,136 --> 00:09:27,002
And I shouldn't try and lie. I know.

196
00:09:27,122 --> 00:09:28,659
I went to medical school.

197
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:30,188
You went to med school?

198
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,779
Yeah, dropped out my last year at clinical.

199
00:09:33,097 --> 00:09:37,935
Too many hours, and I was staring into the ice-cold eyes of divorce.

200
00:09:37,997 --> 00:09:38,657
Wow.

201
00:09:39,015 --> 00:09:43,752
Yeah, I do research now, and I have a life -- a family.

202
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:45,867
No offense. I mean...

203
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:48,093
No, no, that's okay.

204
00:09:48,227 --> 00:09:50,300
I'm just one of those people who believe you can have both.

205
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,128
Maybe so.

206
00:09:52,547 --> 00:09:55,933
But your first responsibility's always gonna be your patient.

207
00:10:18,978 --> 00:10:19,844
Just coffee.

208
00:10:22,864 --> 00:10:23,606
Good.

209
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:24,348
Okay.

210
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:25,065
Okay.

211
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:05,331
We call this "a spaghetti procedure."

212
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:08,427
We cut and deflate the bullae

213
00:11:08,618 --> 00:11:11,837
to facilitate gentle manipulation

214
00:11:12,268 --> 00:11:14,244
of Mrs. Drake's lung.

215
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:17,971
Dr. Bailey, do you see that?

216
00:11:18,663 --> 00:11:19,498
Sir?

217
00:11:21,817 --> 00:11:24,346
Oh, my ever-lovin'...

218
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:26,042
We need to open her up.

219
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,545
I'm taking out the scope.

220
00:11:29,092 --> 00:11:30,875
You heard him, people. Let's move.

221
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,898
Lights.

222
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:33,879
10 blade.

223
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,319
- Here you go.
- Retractors.

224
00:11:36,288 --> 00:11:37,012
Retractors.

225
00:11:38,882 --> 00:11:39,906
Scalpel ready.

226
00:11:42,404 --> 00:11:43,205
Towel.

227
00:11:46,027 --> 00:11:47,372
Rib spreader.

228
00:11:50,885 --> 00:11:51,611
Suction.

229
00:12:01,365 --> 00:12:02,613
Is that a towel?

230
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,857
Get a pan.

231
00:12:04,364 --> 00:12:05,388
Where did that come from?

232
00:12:05,451 --> 00:12:08,706
Best guess -- her surgery five years ago.

233
00:12:10,134 --> 00:12:13,580
Something careless this way comes.

234
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:21,199
-  A towel?
- Not good.

235
00:12:21,286 --> 00:12:23,985
She complained of pressure on her chest, but nobody took her seriously.

236
00:12:24,062 --> 00:12:26,334
Not good for the patient, not good for the hospital.

237
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:27,425
Not good.

238
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:29,437
Cristina, hit the files.

239
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:31,772
Find out everything you can about that initial operation.

240
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:32,606
Who was in that room?

241
00:12:32,663 --> 00:12:34,076
Who was responsible for closing?

242
00:12:34,163 --> 00:12:35,535
George, stay with the patient.

243
00:12:35,623 --> 00:12:37,265
Keep her happy. She seems to like you.

244
00:12:37,378 --> 00:12:39,590
Right, okay, um, how long do you think...?

245
00:12:40,072 --> 00:12:42,882
I mean, just technically, I'm off at 6:00.

246
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:44,337
Am I invited?

247
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:45,421
Excuse me?

248
00:12:45,555 --> 00:12:47,189
Am I invited to the party?

249
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:51,201
Well, yeah. Yes, yeah, of course.

250
00:12:55,064 --> 00:12:56,948
What was I supposed to say?

251
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:05,124
Okay, yeah, great. All right, 14 cases.

252
00:13:05,732 --> 00:13:08,606
What kind? I don't know. Maybe an assortment.

253
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,078
Microbrews -- locals.

254
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,047
Make sure they throw in some bar nuts.

255
00:13:15,273 --> 00:13:17,106
I'm ordering office supplies.

256
00:13:17,185 --> 00:13:18,183
Oh, yeah, sure.

257
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,719
Microbrews -- local. And throw in some bar nuts.

258
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,587
7:00 would be better than 5:00.

259
00:13:23,673 --> 00:13:24,771
Hey, any luck?

260
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,899
Hey, if I do, will you invite me to the party?

261
00:13:30,238 --> 00:13:32,179
Yeah, great. Okay, thanks.

262
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:35,056
- Take it easy. 
- Mr. Frost.

263
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,335
- Where have you been?! 
- We're going to take care of you, all right?

264
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,593
- Just hang on.
- Where the hell have you been?!

265
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:48,338
When I tell you to start a central line, you start a central line -- no judgment, no question.

266
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:51,146
Guy's been in seven hospitals in the last four months. He's a major addict.

267
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,586
The patient has a three-lumbar fusion.

268
00:13:53,668 --> 00:13:55,546
He's a junkie. We shouldn't be giving him --

269
00:13:55,608 --> 00:13:58,599
Yeah, he's an addict, but his pain is real.

270
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,562
Lose the attitude, get down there, start a central line.

271
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:22,263
Told me I had a towel inside me.

272
00:14:22,806 --> 00:14:23,861
Who told you that?

273
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:28,224
A surgeon -- an older man.

274
00:14:28,776 --> 00:14:29,876
Handsome.

275
00:14:30,476 --> 00:14:31,735
That's Dr. Webber.

276
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,954
He's our chief.

277
00:14:33,452 --> 00:14:34,218
Yeah.

278
00:14:35,648 --> 00:14:41,868
It was a towel that somebody left the last time.

279
00:14:41,975 --> 00:14:42,827
Yes, ma'am.

280
00:14:43,287 --> 00:14:44,741
Who would do that?

281
00:14:47,982 --> 00:14:50,167
That doesn't seem right, does it?

282
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:55,298
No, ma'am, no.

283
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:56,721
It doesn't.

284
00:14:58,134 --> 00:15:01,611
I was walking around with a towel inside of me.

285
00:15:02,287 --> 00:15:04,155
How could that happen?

286
00:15:43,914 --> 00:15:46,523
So? What happens now?

287
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,849
Now you keep this to yourself while we work it out.

288
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,434
Do this for me.

289
00:16:14,577 --> 00:16:15,289
You okay?

290
00:16:15,524 --> 00:16:16,640
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

291
00:16:16,722 --> 00:16:18,136
Are you sure? Because you seem not okay.

292
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,293
I'm fine. Cabg was long.

293
00:16:21,391 --> 00:16:24,193
Well, let me take you out to dinner tonight. You can tell me all about it.

294
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:27,289
Real food, waiters, big chunks of carbs in a basket.

295
00:16:27,525 --> 00:16:28,237
I  can't.

296
00:16:28,631 --> 00:16:29,476
Forget the party.

297
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:30,993
You know about the party?

298
00:16:31,094 --> 00:16:33,848
Your friends will be at the party. You and I can be alone somewhere else.

299
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:35,251
How do you know about the party?

300
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:37,765
Thanks for not inviting me, by the way. That felt good.

301
00:16:37,969 --> 00:16:40,074
Dinner -- think about dinner. Perfect opportunity.

302
00:16:40,422 --> 00:16:41,098
Well...

303
00:16:45,784 --> 00:16:46,439
What happened?

304
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,454
Started having swelling over her sternum, then blood started gushing.

305
00:16:49,511 --> 00:16:50,806
Dr. Burke is on his way right now.

306
00:16:50,898 --> 00:16:51,880
Is she dying?

307
00:16:52,081 --> 00:16:54,583
Somebody get him out of here. Keep applying pressure.

308
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:56,871
Tyler, call for an O.R.

309
00:16:56,955 --> 00:16:58,471
What the hell happened? She got her protamine?

310
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:02,204
Per protocol. No allergic, anaphylactic, or histamine responses.

311
00:17:03,085 --> 00:17:04,226
Her last counts?

312
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:08,429
B.T., P.T.T., I.N.R., platelet counts were all stable.

313
00:17:08,516 --> 00:17:10,118
Even her H.N.H. were stable.

314
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:11,706
What the hell went wrong? Let's move.

315
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:13,466
Hold on.

316
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,424
- I popped a glove.
- What?

317
00:17:18,691 --> 00:17:20,691
In surgery, when I was holding it,

318
00:17:20,835 --> 00:17:24,012
I popped a glove with my fingernail. I think I may have nicked her heart.

319
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:26,099
Let's go, people.

320
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,659
You had every opportunity to speak up before I closed her chest. Every opportunity.

321
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:37,910
I'm sorry.

322
00:17:37,977 --> 00:17:39,934
And then you confess in front of her husband?

323
00:17:40,944 --> 00:17:43,573
You don't even know if you were the cause. You have no idea.

324
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:44,673
I'm sorry.

325
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:52,133
Over here.

326
00:17:53,255 --> 00:17:54,002
There.

327
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:56,135
Look at the wall rupture.

328
00:17:56,301 --> 00:17:58,242
It's a hell of a lot more than a fingernail.

329
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,725
Her ventricular walls are weak.

330
00:18:02,016 --> 00:18:05,261
I just had a conversation with Mr. Patterson.

331
00:18:05,436 --> 00:18:09,065
I want copies of his wife's chart in my office by 5:00.

332
00:18:09,139 --> 00:18:11,691
Tomorrow, the two of you are going to meet with me and legal,

333
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:14,682
and you better damn well be able to explain what happened here.

334
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,526
People poking holes in hearts and leaving towels.

335
00:18:20,317 --> 00:18:23,596
You're gonna go back and talk to the husband.

336
00:18:23,806 --> 00:18:25,153
Review the history.

337
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:27,805
Apologize profusely.

338
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,447
Your ass is on the line here, Dr. Grey.

339
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:36,745
You got called before the chief?

340
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:37,979
Tomorrow morning.

341
00:18:38,106 --> 00:18:39,888
I could get kicked out of the program.

342
00:18:40,763 --> 00:18:41,956
I could, right?

343
00:18:42,043 --> 00:18:43,037
You're not getting kicked out.

344
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:44,409
Patterson's just gonna sue.

345
00:18:44,517 --> 00:18:45,986
Patterson is not going to sue.

346
00:18:46,068 --> 00:18:47,425
You're not getting kicked out.

347
00:18:47,512 --> 00:18:50,184
What were you thinking? Telling Burke? So stupid.

348
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,060
I told her not to.

349
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,014
I got to take this.

350
00:18:55,654 --> 00:18:57,722
Thanks. Thank you. Very comforting.

351
00:18:57,792 --> 00:18:58,617
I'll watch your books.

352
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:05,515
Okay, so the beer is coming at 7:00, and some of the floor nurses are bringing wine.

353
00:19:05,821 --> 00:19:07,696
You invited nurses?

354
00:19:08,612 --> 00:19:10,194
Did you clear this with Meredith?

355
00:19:10,271 --> 00:19:11,938
A few more people isn't gonna make a difference, okay?

356
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:13,266
A party is a party.

357
00:19:13,383 --> 00:19:16,030
And the bigger the party, the less time for bad sex.

358
00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:17,669
Would you stop saying that.

359
00:19:17,745 --> 00:19:20,615
- Okay.
- Hank and I have great sex -- all the time.

360
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,276
We'll probably have sex after the party, or during the party.

361
00:19:23,373 --> 00:19:25,790
As long as you clear it with Meredith.

362
00:19:27,368 --> 00:19:29,558
Hank just needs to realize that doctors can have fun.

363
00:19:29,615 --> 00:19:32,328
We're not all workaholics with god complexes.

364
00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:34,580
We are workaholics with god complexes.

365
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:42,563
And the notary can be there at 6:30, too?

366
00:19:44,211 --> 00:19:47,755
And  the home's physician will be there to attest to her mental competency?

367
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:49,568
Okay.

368
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:53,648
Is there anything else I need to bring beside my license?

369
00:19:54,288 --> 00:19:55,506
My checkbook.

370
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,282
6:30 -- I'll be there.

371
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:00,626
I heard.

372
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:04,088
It's a notary thing -- a thing to get notarized.

373
00:20:04,155 --> 00:20:05,423
I'm talking about the heart thing.

374
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,663
Do you want to talk about it?

375
00:20:08,143 --> 00:20:09,192
We're adults.

376
00:20:10,017 --> 00:20:11,547
When did that happen?

377
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:16,386
And how do we make it stop?

378
00:20:32,427 --> 00:20:33,252
Dr. Yang.

379
00:20:34,347 --> 00:20:35,156
Dr. Burke.

380
00:20:38,341 --> 00:20:40,461
That bypass graft got a little complicated.

381
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,796
It's nothing I couldn't handle.

382
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:44,741
Good.

383
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:55,693
Yeah.

384
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:03,168
Listen, I'll call you back.

385
00:21:06,547 --> 00:21:09,296
That was my lawyer. He's advising me not to talk to you.

386
00:21:09,383 --> 00:21:12,870
Mr. Patterson, I know that you're frustrated and angry,

387
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:17,673
but I need -- we need some more information about your wife.

388
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:20,141
The walls of her heart are abnormally thin.

389
00:21:20,207 --> 00:21:21,677
Hey, don't blame this on my wife.

390
00:21:21,764 --> 00:21:24,303
I heard from your very mouth what happened. I know.

391
00:21:24,452 --> 00:21:25,773
But we can't treat her.

392
00:21:25,844 --> 00:21:27,790
No, she was in the best shape of her life.

393
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:29,101
You ask her cardiologist.

394
00:21:29,178 --> 00:21:30,520
She had lost 100 pounds.

395
00:21:30,587 --> 00:21:32,695
Don't you dare try to hang this on her.

396
00:21:33,047 --> 00:21:35,342
- Mr. Patterson, please.
- We're through talking.

397
00:21:55,095 --> 00:21:57,564
You don't like me very much, do you?

398
00:21:57,802 --> 00:22:02,940
Oh, Jerry, it's not you specifically. It's just people like you, that's all.

399
00:22:03,703 --> 00:22:06,170
Doc, I'm feeling pretty good.

400
00:22:06,385 --> 00:22:08,459
Pain's about a 3.

401
00:22:08,521 --> 00:22:10,318
A 3? That's excellent.

402
00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:15,165
Mr. Frost, I'm glad we could help you out, as well as county, mercy west, seattle pres.

403
00:22:15,228 --> 00:22:17,403
A lot of people have helped you out lately, Jerry.

404
00:22:17,445 --> 00:22:18,700
We're pleased we could do our part.

405
00:22:18,986 --> 00:22:20,773
Who's on discharge today, Dr. Karev?

406
00:22:20,901 --> 00:22:21,960
Izzie Stevens.

407
00:22:22,144 --> 00:22:24,340
Mr. Frost, Dr. Stevens is gonna discharge you.

408
00:22:24,413 --> 00:22:26,098
Whoa, you can't discharge me.

409
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:28,473
- I'm in pain.
- You were in pain. Now you're not.

410
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:32,661
Dr. Karev here is going to recommend some wonderful treatment programs for you.

411
00:22:32,733 --> 00:22:33,516
Go home.

412
00:22:33,915 --> 00:22:34,966
Get some help.

413
00:22:35,262 --> 00:22:36,609
You can't just do that!

414
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,077
He just did, my friend.

415
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:42,373
Okay, any luck yet?

416
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:43,833
Nada.

417
00:22:44,626 --> 00:22:46,992
Ugh. Looks like you're gonna have to spend another night.

418
00:22:47,647 --> 00:22:49,521
I hate to miss the party.

419
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:51,210
You gonna make it?

420
00:22:51,347 --> 00:22:54,616
You are the last person on my list, so it's looking pretty good.

421
00:22:54,702 --> 00:22:58,149
So, doctors have lives after all. Who'd have thunk?

422
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:01,323
Dr. Stevens, discharge my guy in 342.

423
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,070
Don't look at me like that.

424
00:23:06,228 --> 00:23:07,538
It's not gonna take very long.

425
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:09,771
It's not.

426
00:23:15,476 --> 00:23:16,320
You paged me?

427
00:23:16,514 --> 00:23:19,116
I'm gonna be a while. Do you think you could get home to sign for the beer?

428
00:23:19,207 --> 00:23:21,675
Why don't you have your boyfriend sign for it?

429
00:23:23,344 --> 00:23:26,329
You have a very annoying way of sneaking up on people.

430
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,248
Maybe if you were a little less creepy...

431
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:29,515
I wouldn't come anyway.

432
00:23:29,677 --> 00:23:30,769
I hate big parties.

433
00:23:30,907 --> 00:23:34,016
Is Meredith the only person who doesn't know the size of this thing?

434
00:23:34,107 --> 00:23:35,165
I'm telling her.

435
00:23:35,346 --> 00:23:36,708
You can't. She's gone already.

436
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:37,691
What, already?

437
00:23:37,911 --> 00:23:41,991
I think she had -- um, excuse me -- an errand to run.

438
00:23:42,903 --> 00:23:45,550
You don't think Meredith's going to mind, right?

439
00:23:45,628 --> 00:23:49,385
I want you to make it very clear to her that I had nothing to do with this party --

440
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,323
nothing.

441
00:24:02,354 --> 00:24:04,116
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late. It was the traffic.

442
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,236
It doesn't matter, dear.

443
00:24:05,363 --> 00:24:07,500
Okay. Don't tell me the notary didn't show.

444
00:24:07,561 --> 00:24:10,351
Oh, everybody's here. It's just your mother isn't.

445
00:24:12,722 --> 00:24:13,464
Mom?

446
00:24:14,084 --> 00:24:14,713
Mom?

447
00:24:15,368 --> 00:24:16,572
What do you people want from me?

448
00:24:16,996 --> 00:24:18,989
We need you to sign the lawyer's papers.

449
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:21,918
I have a cranial reconstruction in a half an hour. I need to go.

450
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:23,801
Okay, mom. We're all here.

451
00:24:23,873 --> 00:24:24,868
We have a notary.

452
00:24:25,036 --> 00:24:26,347
I need you to focus,

453
00:24:26,561 --> 00:24:28,529
and I need you to sign these papers.

454
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,491
Mom, look at me.

455
00:24:33,883 --> 00:24:35,450
It's an emergency surgery.

456
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:36,581
I don't have time for this.

457
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,322
She can't sign anything now.

458
00:24:38,496 --> 00:24:40,953
We should have done this earlier in the day.

459
00:24:41,015 --> 00:24:42,777
I couldn't come earlier in the day.

460
00:24:42,879 --> 00:24:46,110
I have a job and a life, and I'm here now.

461
00:24:46,197 --> 00:24:48,936
You're gonna have to come back tomorrow, when she's lucid.

462
00:24:49,076 --> 00:24:51,697
You know, why did she put this off for so long?

463
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:53,150
And why did you let her?

464
00:24:53,216 --> 00:24:55,720
Doesn't it strike you as slightly irresponsible?

465
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:58,220
I mean, what the hell is wrong with you people?!

466
00:26:14,804 --> 00:26:17,221
Izzie, I'm gonna kill you.

467
00:26:24,327 --> 00:26:26,811
You could touch that, but I'd have to kill you.

468
00:26:32,449 --> 00:26:33,799
So, about that towel thing?

469
00:26:33,887 --> 00:26:35,142
It's been taken care of.

470
00:26:35,991 --> 00:26:36,739
Okay.

471
00:26:37,547 --> 00:26:40,041
You don't need to concern yourself with it.

472
00:26:40,323 --> 00:26:41,458
So, what's gonna happen?

473
00:26:41,547 --> 00:26:44,567
We're not gonna talk about it anymore is what's gonna happen -- we clear?

474
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:47,716
Or you had too much alcohol to understand me?

475
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,345
We're very clear.

476
00:26:49,473 --> 00:26:50,149
Good.

477
00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:52,519
You have any bourbon?

478
00:27:00,711 --> 00:27:02,411
You can't discharge a man in pain.

479
00:27:02,653 --> 00:27:03,880
You're hurting me!

480
00:27:03,962 --> 00:27:06,260
You're the one who's making it difficult. Stop resisting.

481
00:27:06,336 --> 00:27:08,325
Just give me the hit of demerol.

482
00:27:08,887 --> 00:27:10,398
The dilaudid hasn't worn off yet.

483
00:27:10,455 --> 00:27:13,303
- Mr. Frost, you have to...
- Look, I'm not leaving.

484
00:27:13,404 --> 00:27:14,330
I'm calling psych.

485
00:27:14,422 --> 00:27:16,599
No, no. Don't call psych.

486
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,464
Wait, wait, wait.

487
00:27:17,945 --> 00:27:19,922
Stop, Jerry. Stop. Stop. Stop.

488
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,450
Jerry. Jerry!

489
00:27:26,527 --> 00:27:27,217
Concussion?

490
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:32,138
He's blown his left pupil.

491
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:34,262
Page Shepherd. We gotta get him down to C.T.

492
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:38,609
That was one hard fall.

493
00:27:38,697 --> 00:27:39,583
What do you see?

494
00:27:44,301 --> 00:27:45,333
Subdural bleed.

495
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,812
With midline shift.

496
00:27:47,068 --> 00:27:48,573
We have to evacuate this now.

497
00:27:48,908 --> 00:27:52,239
Anywhere else you have to be, Dr. Stevens, or are you in?

498
00:27:52,987 --> 00:27:53,959
Brain surgery?

499
00:27:54,641 --> 00:27:55,592
Are you kidding me?

500
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:56,714
That's what I thought.

501
00:28:21,316 --> 00:28:22,566
Where is Izzie?!

502
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,746
She didn't clear it with you?

503
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:30,076
This was supposed to be a meet-the-boyfriend get-together little thing!

504
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:32,538
Izzie has a lot of friends.

505
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:36,487
Izzie doesn't know this many people.

506
00:28:36,569 --> 00:28:38,124
I told her to clear it with you.

507
00:28:38,248 --> 00:28:40,157
I can't handle this.

508
00:28:40,276 --> 00:28:41,888
You want me to kick everyone out?

509
00:28:42,365 --> 00:28:44,264
I'm gonna kick everyone out.

510
00:28:47,386 --> 00:28:49,902
Baby, you made it! Whoo!

511
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:52,984
Screw it.

512
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,643
Hold this.

513
00:28:55,614 --> 00:28:56,844
And give me this.

514
00:29:01,803 --> 00:29:03,079
I made it!

515
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:09,143
George! George, come here. Come on.

516
00:29:37,882 --> 00:29:38,649
See it?

517
00:29:38,936 --> 00:29:39,719
It's hard to miss.

518
00:29:41,108 --> 00:29:42,305
Little more than he bargained for.

519
00:29:42,427 --> 00:29:44,864
Maybe he's lucky. Maybe this is his way out of the hole.

520
00:29:45,478 --> 00:29:46,289
The hole?

521
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:47,506
Interesting expression.

522
00:29:49,348 --> 00:29:51,833
My father was into smack pretty heavy. He was a musician.

523
00:29:52,105 --> 00:29:53,876
It's tolerated in his line of work.

524
00:29:54,004 --> 00:29:55,323
Not good for the family at home.

525
00:30:03,908 --> 00:30:06,338
Why do we want to be surgeons, anyway?

526
00:30:06,409 --> 00:30:08,356
Surgery is a very serious business.

527
00:30:10,032 --> 00:30:10,941
Full house.

528
00:30:12,508 --> 00:30:13,706
Royal flush.

529
00:30:14,044 --> 00:30:16,061
Get naked, baby boy.

530
00:30:17,766 --> 00:30:19,635
- Surgery is stupid.
- You're so sexy!

531
00:30:19,712 --> 00:30:20,604
It's stupid.

532
00:30:20,858 --> 00:30:22,420
- It's stupid.
- Give me that. You're drunk.

533
00:30:22,851 --> 00:30:24,029
I'm not driving.

534
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:25,288
I'm not on call.

535
00:30:25,385 --> 00:30:26,732
I'm in my own house.

536
00:30:26,838 --> 00:30:28,191
My life is crap.

537
00:30:28,687 --> 00:30:31,364
And it's my party, and I'll get drunk if I want to.

538
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,118
Is, um, Izzie Stevens...?

539
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:36,725
Oh, you must be Hank.

540
00:30:40,044 --> 00:30:42,085
He's very large and hockey-like.

541
00:30:42,184 --> 00:30:43,576
No, Izzie's not here right now.

542
00:30:44,351 --> 00:30:45,149
Okay.

543
00:30:46,033 --> 00:30:49,863
You and Izzie will give birth to very tall, blond people...

544
00:30:50,273 --> 00:30:51,271
like barbies.

545
00:30:51,421 --> 00:30:52,860
Izzie said she was gonna be at home.

546
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,466
She didn't say there was gonna be a party.

547
00:30:54,565 --> 00:30:56,485
Well, she pisses both of us off.

548
00:30:56,756 --> 00:30:58,494
Would you like some tequila? It helps.

549
00:30:58,595 --> 00:31:00,287
When do you think she's gonna get here?

550
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:01,168
Don't know.

551
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:03,375
Look, we're low on ice, Hank.

552
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:05,219
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

553
00:31:06,442 --> 00:31:07,794
We're interns, Hank.

554
00:31:08,107 --> 00:31:10,810
The hospital owns us. It's what we do.

555
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:14,103
Bye.

556
00:31:14,394 --> 00:31:15,347
Nice to meet you.

557
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:17,927
Can you guys see him through recovery?

558
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,734
- Yeah, I'll take it.
- No, I can do it.

559
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:21,202
That's okay, Stevens.

560
00:31:21,393 --> 00:31:22,713
He's my patient now, too.

561
00:31:22,831 --> 00:31:25,135
No, I got it. See your hockey player. I'm serious.

562
00:31:26,323 --> 00:31:27,049
Yeah, okay.

563
00:31:27,977 --> 00:31:29,267
I guess. Thanks, Alex.

564
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:30,788
No problem.

565
00:31:45,358 --> 00:31:46,057
Hey!

566
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,071
Hey.

567
00:31:47,475 --> 00:31:48,390
What are you doing here?

568
00:31:54,114 --> 00:31:55,892
I'm sorry I didn't have a chance to call.

569
00:31:56,783 --> 00:31:58,487
My patient needed brain surgery.

570
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:01,381
Like, we were inside his brain. How cool is that?

571
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:03,967
Oh, my god.

572
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:09,034
There's a party at your house.

573
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:10,654
Yeah, did you get a chance to hang out?

574
00:32:10,736 --> 00:32:12,476
I wanted you to meet some of the people I work with.

575
00:32:13,283 --> 00:32:16,767
I don't care about the people you work with. I just want to see you.

576
00:32:17,615 --> 00:32:20,919
You didn't mind meeting the people I worked with when they were models.

577
00:32:21,104 --> 00:32:25,629
Yeah, well, when they were models, you actually showed up to your own parties.

578
00:32:26,884 --> 00:32:27,692
Yeah.

579
00:32:32,224 --> 00:32:34,369
This is my life now, Hank.

580
00:32:34,937 --> 00:32:36,596
I work 100-hour weeks.

581
00:32:36,986 --> 00:32:39,161
I can't always show up to my own parties on time.

582
00:32:39,243 --> 00:32:41,373
My patients have to come first. It's just...

583
00:32:41,578 --> 00:32:46,510
Yeah, I just flew across the entire country, and there's a hundred people at your house.

584
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,562
A hundred people who understand what I do all day.

585
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,696
I shouldn't have to apologize for that.

586
00:32:51,214 --> 00:32:52,699
No, you shouldn't.

587
00:33:00,174 --> 00:33:03,374
Look, let's just go by the party for a little while.

588
00:33:03,805 --> 00:33:06,410
You'll really like everyone once you get a chance to know them.

589
00:33:08,547 --> 00:33:09,605
I should just go.

590
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,254
Hank, come on.

591
00:33:14,337 --> 00:33:15,195
I'll call you.

592
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,364
You know, in some states, you get arrested for that.

593
00:34:27,903 --> 00:34:30,087
So, you blew me off for a bottle of tequila.

594
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:31,669
Tequila's no good for you --

595
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,222
doesn't call, doesn't write.

596
00:34:33,437 --> 00:34:35,567
It's not nearly as much fun to wake up to.

597
00:34:50,051 --> 00:34:51,818
Take me for a ride, Derek.

598
00:34:57,705 --> 00:35:00,107
You know, it sounds like the party's winding down.

599
00:35:00,618 --> 00:35:02,487
- Listen to me!
- What?

600
00:35:02,565 --> 00:35:04,362
We should probably sneak inside now.

601
00:35:05,432 --> 00:35:07,536
We've done enough sneaking for the night.

602
00:35:07,603 --> 00:35:09,456
It was good sneaking, but enough sneaking.

603
00:35:09,523 --> 00:35:10,992
Yeah, I'd say we're pretty good sneakers.

604
00:35:17,094 --> 00:35:19,009
You mind moving this tail wagon?

605
00:35:19,081 --> 00:35:20,433
You're blocking me in.

606
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:25,129
Apparently not good enough.

607
00:35:47,463 --> 00:35:48,997
When's your meeting with the chief?

608
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:52,235
In an hour.

609
00:35:57,318 --> 00:35:59,341
Holy mother of destruction.

610
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,671
You missed doctor-palooza.

611
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,620
Apparently, you didn't.

612
00:36:05,276 --> 00:36:07,568
I should probably never speak to you again.

613
00:36:08,855 --> 00:36:10,226
I'm so sorry, Meredith.

614
00:36:10,615 --> 00:36:12,469
I had no idea it was going to get so...

615
00:36:13,289 --> 00:36:14,152
It's okay.

616
00:36:14,828 --> 00:36:16,308
Really, I don't care.

617
00:36:17,245 --> 00:36:18,919
What would I be doing, anyway?

618
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:21,346
Preparing for your career-altering meeting.

619
00:36:21,521 --> 00:36:22,473
Sorry.

620
00:36:22,631 --> 00:36:24,510
That heart wall shouldn't have torn.

621
00:36:25,212 --> 00:36:26,825
Anything in the patient's history?

622
00:36:27,813 --> 00:36:30,700
Husband said she was in the best shape of her life.

623
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:33,384
She lost 100 pounds last year.

624
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:36,742
100 pounds in a year -- how's her muscle mass?

625
00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:42,579
Do you even know whose that was?

626
00:36:43,617 --> 00:36:44,760
I'm hoping it was yours.

627
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:45,876
No.

628
00:36:49,461 --> 00:36:50,888
What do you think?

629
00:36:51,927 --> 00:36:56,291
50 says Meredith gets tossed out on her ass and Burke walks away clean.

630
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:57,596
Please be nice to her.

631
00:36:59,245 --> 00:37:02,153
So, I have done a lot of research on this,

632
00:37:02,204 --> 00:37:04,457
and Dr. Burke has been kind enough to help me.

633
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:08,728
And I understand my responsibility in what I've done wrong here.

634
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:13,355
However, I do think the patient's history is significant in this case.

635
00:37:13,427 --> 00:37:15,470
She still weighs 200 pounds,

636
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:17,482
which is why no one even noticed it.

637
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:20,595
But, with that kind of a weight drop, it doesn't matter how much you weigh -- 

638
00:37:20,669 --> 00:37:22,345
technically, you're anorexic.

639
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,546
Along with all that fat, she was losing heart muscle.

640
00:37:25,608 --> 00:37:28,844
That certainly could be the reason for a small poke to become a large tear.

641
00:37:28,901 --> 00:37:30,778
That still doesn't change the fact, though.

642
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,897
The poke wasn't reported at the time of the occurrence.

643
00:37:33,933 --> 00:37:36,729
- And if I could change that... 
- And you can't.

644
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:40,071
You've left yourself and the hospital open to a tremendous amount of liability.

645
00:37:40,129 --> 00:37:43,459
- Not if the weight loss caused the problem.
- I'm sorry, I've no choice...

646
00:37:43,515 --> 00:37:48,079
I've spoken to the husband, and I believe as long as his wife remains stable --

647
00:37:48,148 --> 00:37:51,510
I can't take your beliefs to the bank, Dr. Burke.

648
00:37:51,624 --> 00:37:53,978
- Dr. Grey made a huge error here.
- And she reported it.

649
00:37:54,044 --> 00:37:54,884
Too late.

650
00:37:54,956 --> 00:37:56,799
And in front of the patient's husband.

651
00:37:56,886 --> 00:37:58,776
But she reported it. She spoke up.

652
00:38:02,662 --> 00:38:04,714
Five years ago, as a C.T. fellow,

653
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:07,495
I had a nagging feeling that I didn't check the body cavity

654
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,250
of a lung patient closely enough before I closed.

655
00:38:10,378 --> 00:38:13,362
The patient seemed fine post-op, and I was in a hurry.

656
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:20,039
And yesterday you and Dr. Bailey pulled a towel out from under that patient's lung.

657
00:38:20,234 --> 00:38:23,038
Why didn't I report it at an appropriate time?

658
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:25,901
Maybe because I was afraid that I would be called

659
00:38:25,943 --> 00:38:30,817
into a meeting where some hospital lawyer's fear of liability could end my career.

660
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:35,127
Even great doctors make mistakes, and when we do,

661
00:38:35,205 --> 00:38:38,942
we've got to have a chance to speak up without fear of retribution.

662
00:38:39,634 --> 00:38:41,032
Or everyone suffers.

663
00:38:41,544 --> 00:38:43,131
Dr. Grey spoke up.

664
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:58,968
Responsibility -- it really does suck.

665
00:39:03,882 --> 00:39:05,230
Meredith. You okay?

666
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,750
Yeah, one-month probation.

667
00:39:06,831 --> 00:39:08,464
- That's good.
- Yep.

668
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:10,236
Burke saved my ass.

669
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:13,564
Don't you all have something better to do? Come on, people, move!

670
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,049
He was always gonna tell them about the towel.

671
00:39:18,111 --> 00:39:19,923
Just wanted to wait for the right time.

672
00:39:20,015 --> 00:39:22,263
Information is power.

673
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:57,260
Unfortunately, once you get past the age of braces and training bras,

674
00:39:57,613 --> 00:39:59,692
responsibility doesn't go away.

675
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:08,882
Jerry, this is sloane. She's here to talk to you, if you want, about options for rehab.

676
00:40:12,821 --> 00:40:14,293
It can't be avoided.

677
00:40:17,701 --> 00:40:18,691
Mrs. Drake,

678
00:40:19,439 --> 00:40:22,629
I cannot begin to tell you how truly sorry I am.

679
00:40:23,428 --> 00:40:25,455
Either someone makes us face it,

680
00:40:26,443 --> 00:40:29,693
or we suffer the consequences.

681
00:40:41,675 --> 00:40:44,205
Izzie! I did it! I pooped!

682
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:45,203
All right!

683
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:51,292
Missed your party?

684
00:40:51,455 --> 00:40:52,418
Life as a surgeon.

685
00:40:52,494 --> 00:40:53,765
And loving every minute of it.

686
00:41:13,415 --> 00:41:17,357
And still, adulthood has its perks.

687
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:20,583
Thanks for the coffee.

688
00:41:42,425 --> 00:41:47,443
I mean, the shoes, the sex, the no parents anywhere telling you what to do...

689
00:41:51,524 --> 00:41:54,826
that's pretty damn good.
