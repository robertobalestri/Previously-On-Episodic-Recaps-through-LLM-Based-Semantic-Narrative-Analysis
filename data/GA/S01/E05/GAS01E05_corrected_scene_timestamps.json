Meredith helps Jerry understand the next steps and encourages him to consider treatment for his addiction. Meanwhile, Meredith approaches Mrs. Drake to apologize for the surgical towel left inside her during a previous operation, taking responsibility for the hospital\u2019s mistake. Jerry, relieved after his ordeal, celebrates finally having a bowel movement, a small but meaningful victory for him. Meredith\u2019s internal monologue reflects on how adulthood brings unavoidable responsibilities, and that facing them\u2014no matter how difficult\u2014is part of growing up.",
