As she wakes, her voiceover reflects on the simplicity of childhood worries\u2014like hoping for a bike on her birthday or wanting cookies for breakfast\u2014and contrasts them with the overwhelming responsibilities of adulthood. She muses that adulthood is overrated, despite its supposed perks, because it is defined by responsibility. Meredith is then approached by a lawyer, who informs her that her mother, Ellis Grey, is in the early stages of advancing Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The lawyer explains that while Ellis is still lucid enough to consent, Meredith must arrange for her mother to sign over her estate, finances, and medical care. Overwhelmed and sleep-deprived, Meredith asks why she has to handle this alone, but the lawyer insists that as Ellis\u2019s daughter, the responsibility falls to her. Meredith\u2019s narration continues, emphasizing the burdens of adult life and the weight of responsibility she now carries.",
