George says that his mom irons his scrubs and he wants out, hinting he wants to be Meredith's roommate, but she doesn't think it's a good idea. Izzie tries to ask as well but Meredith says no. Meredith says she just wants two strangers who she doesn't have to talk to or be nice to.

Bailey arrives and assigns the interns their tasks. As Bailey goes up the stairs, Meredith asks if she could assist her in the OR and offers her a mocha latte. The interns immediately crowd Bailey, saying if Meredith gets to cut they all should. Bailey says that it isn't their job and their job is to make their resident happy, which Bailey isn't. She takes the mocha latte and leaves, saying they won't hold a scalpel until she is as happy as Mary Poppins.

Meredith heads to an elevator, where Derek is waiting as well. He notes that Seattle has ferry boats, which he didn't know as he has only been living there for six weeks. As the doors open, he says he's from New York. When the doors close, Meredith says she won't go out with him. Derek says he never asked, but asks if she wants to. She says no, and she won't sleep with him, since he is her boss. Derek dismisses her, and Meredith says he's sexually harassing her. She says she's drawing a line, and Derek asks if she needs a marker. Meredith stares at him, and drops her folders and they make out until the doors open. Meredith picks up her folders and leaves.

Meredith arrives at a trauma room where the nurse says that they have a rape victim who was found down at the park and has major injuries. Meredith starts to zone out when she sees that the victim's shoes are the same as hers, but when a nurse calls her she snaps out of her daze and starts giving orders.

The rape victim is in surgery. Derek says she will spend a lot of time in recovery and rehab, and is shocked to see that she is alive after what that guy did to her. Burke notes that she tried to fight back, but Derek replies that she kicked his ass since the rape kit was negative. Burke calls her a warrior, but Meredith says her name is Allison. Burke says that he found the cause of the rupture, but doesn't know what it is. He asks the room, and Meredith replies that it is the rapist's penis and the doctors mumble in disgust.

As Derek and Burke scrub out, they discuss Allison's recovery. Burke says they should get a drink later and Derek can tell him why he left New York for Seattle, but he says there is nothing to tell, Webber made him an offer he couldn't refuse and leaves.

George brags to Cristina about being on the code team, but she tells him to stop talking. She says she has a B.A. from Smith, a PhD from Berkeley, and a M.D. from Stanford and she is delivering labs and says it'll take her all day to get through them. Bailey overhears this and tells her she should get started. Cristina tries to say she wasn't complaining but Bailey overrides her and says she has an reassigned intern and that Cristina should show him how Bailey does things. The intern introduces himself as Alex Karev, and Cristina remembers he's the one that called Meredith a nurse, and she tells him she hates him on principle, and Alex says he does too as they walk away.

Izzie then asks the room if anybody speaks Chinese, but nobody answers.

Meredith arrives at the Chief's office. Patricia is there and realizes the box has the rapist's penis. She asks if she can see it but immediately changes her mind. Richard comes in and says that he heard Meredith's mother is leaving Mayo, and she explains that her mother is just taking a break. Meredith says that she was told to bring the "penis box" to him. Richard corrects her, saying the police need it, and until that she needs take it with her since all medical matter must stay with the person who collected it until it is placed into police custody.

Cristina and Alex are giving lab results to a family, who tells the patient that they have a disorder called multinucleate cell angiohistiocytoma, it's not a cancerous sarcoma, it's a very rare but minor disease and that they will be discharged that day. The family is relieved and one hugs Cristina. She glares at Alex, who's smiling at her.

Meredith places her penis box on a counter where George is working. He asks what it is, and Meredith says he doesn't want to know, but he says he really wants to, and Meredith tells him what it is. He regrets wanting to know. Cristina and Alex walk by and she complains why she gets hugged all the time, and Alex says it's because she's an ovarian sister. Cristina is insulted and George says Meredith is carrying a penis around in a jar. Cristina takes a look, makes a joke about it, and leaves. George asks Meredith if she's ok and she explains to him that Allison has the same shoes she was wearing, and says they are uncomfortable and barely wears them, but she did that day.

The intern says she knows but Meredith is shocked and tells her that the baby turned blue. The intern tells Meredith isn't authorized to be there. She asks if she is going to do any tests but the intern says it's benign and it goes away with age. She tells Meredith to leave, and she does so.

Izzie brings Cristina, thinking that she knows Chinese and asks if she could translate for Ms. Lu. Ms. Lu keeps reiterating that her daughter is outside with a gash on her head, and she wants to help stitch it up, but she cannot. However, Cristina says she is from Beverly Hills and the only Chinese she knows is from a Mr. Chou's menu. She also informs her that she is Korean, and she leaves.

Burke asks Richard why he asked Derek to come to Seattle Grace. Richard tells him it's because Derek is an old student of his. Burke then realizes there could be another reason and says that Chief of Surgery is his. Richard says he won't be leaving for a while and Burke storms off.

When they get inside, Meredith calls for security and shows Bailey the rapist. She instructs Meredith to take him to OR 1 and inform the Chief that they have him.

As the rapist is in surgery, Cristina and Meredith talk about Allison and the rapist. Bailey then asks why they don't reattach the penis, and Meredith says that they can't reattach without a clean cut, and Allison's digestive juices didn't leave much to work with. Meredith says he will be peeing out of a bag for a long time and Cristina notes he won't be able to ever have sex again, which she says is a shame. Bailey sarcastically says that they should take a moment to grieve, and they return to operating again.

The intern gets her resident, Dr. Kay. He asks what's wrong and Mr and Mrs. Johnson says if their child is sick they want him treated. Kay asks who told them that and the intern says it's Meredith. When Kay asks if she's authorized to be here, Burke says he did. He asks the intern if she's 100% sure that the murmur is benign and when the intern says 75%, Burke says that the baby is on his service now and introduces himself to the baby's parents. The intern asks Kay if he can steal patients and Kay says he can since he's an attending. Burke introduces himself to the parents and gives Meredith instructions.

After Izzie is all done with suturing for the day, she sees Ms. Lu. She beckons Izzie outside and sees her with a girl, Ahn, who has a big laceration on her forehead. Izzie comes over and says she'll help. She examines the laceration. Ahn explains that a machine broke in the factory and injured her.
