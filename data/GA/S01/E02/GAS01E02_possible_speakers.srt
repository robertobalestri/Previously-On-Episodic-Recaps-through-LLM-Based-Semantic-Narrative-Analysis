00:20:44,058 --> 00:20:45,662
Cristina Yang / Patient (PVM): Make out with Dr. McDreamy?

442
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:54,255
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): You know, that and carrying around a penis just makes everything seem so shiny and happy.

443
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,221
Izzie Stevens / Patient OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): George said Allison was wearing your shoes.

444

445
00:20:58,807 --> 00:20:59,569

00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:02,097
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): It's weird that you care.

447
00:21:03,942 --> 00:21:04,967

448
00:21:30,511 --> 00:21:31,615
Hospital Staff (Nurse or Receptionist) / Mrs. Liu OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Can I have security, please?

451
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:45,268
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Let's get them to OR1.

452
00:21:45,307 --> 00:21:48,015
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Meredith, you call the chief and let him know we got the rapist.

453
00:22:02,575 --> 00:22:05,779
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I saw Allison.

454
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:07,683

455
00:22:08,184 --> 00:22:09,067

456
00:22:09,406 --> 00:22:11,332
George O'Malley / Patient OR Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): It's like that old saying, you should see the other guy.

457
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,895
Cristina Yang / Patient OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Why are we not attempting to reattach the severed penis?

458
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,337
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Patient (PVM): Teeth don't slice, they tear.

459
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:16,942

460
00:22:17,221 --> 00:22:18,846

461
00:22:19,028 --> 00:22:22,250
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Besides, the digestive juices didn't leave much of the flesh to work with.

462
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:22,852
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Right.

463
00:22:22,872 --> 00:22:23,570
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): So what do we do?

464
00:22:23,913 --> 00:22:25,634
Cristina Yang / Patient (PVM): Sew him up minus a large part of the family jewels.

465
00:22:26,055 --> 00:22:26,914
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): And his outlook?

466
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:30,117
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): He'll be urinating out of a bag for a very, very long time.

467
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,759
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Not to mention he'll never be able to have sex again.

468
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:32,601

470
00:22:33,362 --> 00:22:34,781

472
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:41,568

473
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,112
Richard Webber / Dr. Richard Webber (PVM): We got the rapist.

474
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,433
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Richard Webber (PVM): He stumbled right into the hospital.

475
00:22:47,095 --> 00:22:47,736

476
00:22:50,855 --> 00:22:51,454
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Richard Webber (PVM): Listen, Bert.

477
00:22:51,714 --> 00:22:52,016
Richard Webber / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Why?

478
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:53,698
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Richard Webber (PVM): You really want to know?

479
00:22:54,357 --> 00:22:56,382
Richard Webber / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): I want to know when you stop thinking of me as your number one.

480
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,548
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. Richard Webber (PVM): Richard, I do more in this hospital than any other surgeon you have.

481
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:04,309
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Richard Webber (PVM): You do only exactly as much as is necessary.

482
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,294
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Richard Webber (PVM): You never take an extra step.

483
00:23:06,492 --> 00:23:07,713
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Richard Webber (PVM): You never give an extra minute.

484
00:23:08,717 --> 00:23:11,538
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Richard Webber (PVM): You're comfortable and arrogant, and it doesn't impress me.

485
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:13,442
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Richard Webber (PVM): You want to be chief?

486
00:23:13,461 --> 00:23:13,942
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Richard Webber (PVM): Earn it.

487
00:23:44,751 --> 00:23:47,596
Dr. Alex Karev / Dr. Isobel Stevens OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I'm sorry.

488

490
00:23:49,837 --> 00:23:51,019

491
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:52,520
Dr. Alex Karev / Dr. Isobel Stevens OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I'm sorry.

492
00:23:52,540 --> 00:24:01,392

495
00:24:13,795 --> 00:24:14,634
Dr. Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Maybe it's a tumor.

496
00:24:15,076 --> 00:24:16,278
Dr. George O'Malley / Patient (PVM): You wish I had a tumor.

497
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:18,882
Dr. Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Look, I'd rip your face off if it meant I got to scrub in.

498
00:24:19,362 --> 00:24:20,942
Dr. Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I've been suturing all day.

499
00:24:20,962 --> 00:24:23,125
Dr. Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): My hands are numb.

500
00:24:23,548 --> 00:24:24,627
Dr. George O'Malley / Patient OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): At least you're helping people.

501
00:24:24,949 --> 00:24:28,452
Meredith Grey / Patient OR Dr. Cutlin (PVM): At least you get to practice freaking medicine.

502
00:24:28,472 --> 00:24:29,875
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Cutlin (PVM): I had to send my Chinese lady away.

503
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:32,519

504
00:24:32,557 --> 00:24:35,102

505
00:24:35,122 --> 00:24:36,182
Alex Karev / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Boo hoo.

506
00:24:36,202 --> 00:24:40,548
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): So the police say they can't send a crime scene guy down for hours.

507
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:42,672
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): So I have to spend the night with a penis.

508
00:24:44,373 --> 00:24:45,712
Izzie Stevens / Patient OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Alex, don't say it.

509
00:24:46,173 --> 00:24:47,214
Alex Karev / Patient (PVM): Oh, it's too easy anyway.

510
00:24:50,357 --> 00:24:52,358
Meredith Grey / Patient OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Who here feels like they have no idea what they're doing?

511
00:24:55,063 --> 00:24:56,963
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I mean, are we supposed to be learning something?

512
00:24:56,983 --> 00:24:58,444
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Because I don't feel like I'm learning anything.

513
00:24:58,704 --> 00:24:59,747
George O'Malley / Patient (PVM): Except how not to sleep.

514
00:24:59,925 --> 00:25:10,297
Meredith Grey / Patient OR Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): You know, it's like there's this wall, and the attendings and the residents are over there being surgeons, and we're over here being... Suturing, code running, lab delivering, penis minders.

515
00:25:10,317 --> 00:25:11,576
Cristina Yang / Patient OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I hate being an intern.

516
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:44,336

523
00:26:06,569 --> 00:26:07,991
Another intern / Applicant (PVM): You are so out of line.

524
00:26:09,153 --> 00:26:10,654
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Cutlin (PVM): She says the murmur might not be benign.

525
00:26:11,656 --> 00:26:13,440
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I think we should do an echo to check.

526
00:26:14,101 --> 00:26:14,961
Attending physician / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): This is your career.

527
00:26:16,364 --> 00:26:18,404

528
00:26:20,008 --> 00:26:20,709

530
00:26:25,295 --> 00:26:26,256
Attending physician / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Who said your baby was sick?

531
00:26:26,415 --> 00:26:29,078
Parent (Mr. Liu or Mrs. Liu) / Applicant (PVM): Her, the surgical intern who has no business on our service.

532
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:30,740

533
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:34,487
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Applicant OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I was just actually... Hey, dude.

534
00:26:34,507 --> 00:26:35,228
Izzie Stevens / Applicant OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Could you excuse me for a second?

535
00:26:36,134 --> 00:26:39,377

Dr. K / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): No, sir.

537
00:26:41,461 --> 00:26:41,922

540
00:26:43,363 --> 00:26:43,762

Dr. Preston Burke: That okay with you, Dr. K?

549
00:26:57,635 --> 00:26:58,177
