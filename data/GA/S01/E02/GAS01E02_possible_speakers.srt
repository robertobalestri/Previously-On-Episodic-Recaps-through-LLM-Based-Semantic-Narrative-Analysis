281
00:12:39,984 --> 00:12:40,803
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey (PVM): But today I did.

285
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:48,831

286
00:12:51,332 --> 00:12:52,014

444
00:20:57,064 --> 00:20:57,423
Meredith Grey / Alex Kreb (PVM): Yeah.

445
00:20:58,807 --> 00:20:59,569

446
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:02,097
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): It's weird that you care.

447
00:21:03,942 --> 00:21:04,967
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey (PVM): I think it's weird.

448
00:21:30,511 --> 00:21:31,615
Hospital Staff (e.g., Nurse or Security) / Meredith Grey (PVM): Can I have security, please?

449

450
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:44,046
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Take a look.

451
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:45,268
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Let's get them to OR1.

452
00:21:45,307 --> 00:21:48,015
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Meredith, you call the chief and let him know we got the rapist.

453
00:22:02,575 --> 00:22:05,779
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Cutlin OR Meredith Grey (PVM): I saw Allison.

454
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:07,683

455
00:22:08,184 --> 00:22:09,067

456
00:22:09,406 --> 00:22:11,332
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Meredith Grey (PVM): It's like that old saying, you should see the other guy.

457
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,895
Dr. Preston Burke / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Meredith Grey (PVM): Why are we not attempting to reattach the severed penis?

458
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,337
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Teeth don't slice, they tear.

459
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:16,942
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Meredith Grey (PVM): You can only reattach with a clean cut.

460
00:22:17,221 --> 00:22:18,846
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Meredith Grey (PVM): She wanted to slice him off with a knife.

461
00:22:19,028 --> 00:22:22,250
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Besides, the digestive juices didn't leave much of the flesh to work with.

462
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:22,852
Dr. George O'Malley / Meredith Grey (PVM): Right.

463
00:22:22,872 --> 00:22:23,570
Dr. Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey (PVM): So what do we do?

464
00:22:23,913 --> 00:22:25,634
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Sew him up minus a large part of the family jewels.

465
00:22:26,055 --> 00:22:26,914
Dr. George O'Malley / Meredith Grey (PVM): And his outlook?

466
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:30,117
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Meredith Grey (PVM): He'll be urinating out of a bag for a very, very long time.

467
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,759
Dr. Alex Karev / Meredith Grey (PVM): Not to mention he'll never be able to have sex again.

468
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:32,601
Dr. Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Meredith Grey (PVM): Oh, too bad.

469
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,342
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Meredith Grey (PVM): Shane.

470
00:22:33,362 --> 00:22:34,781
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Meredith Grey (PVM): Let's all take a moment to grieve.

471
00:22:35,462 --> 00:22:41,230

472
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:41,568

473
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,112
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Richard Webber (PVM): We got the rapist.

474
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,433
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Richard Webber (PVM): He stumbled right into the hospital.

475
00:22:47,095 --> 00:22:47,736
Dr. Richard Webber / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Yeah, I heard.

476
00:22:50,855 --> 00:22:51,454
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Richard Webber (PVM): Listen, Bert.

477
00:22:51,714 --> 00:22:52,016
Dr. Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Why?

478
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:53,698
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Richard Webber (PVM): You really want to know?

479
00:22:54,357 --> 00:22:56,382
Dr. Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): I want to know when you stop thinking of me as your number one.

480
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,548
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Richard Webber OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Richard, I do more in this hospital than any other surgeon you have.

481
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:04,309
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Richard Webber (PVM): You do only exactly as much as is necessary.

482
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,294
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Richard Webber (PVM): You never take an extra step.

483
00:23:06,492 --> 00:23:07,713
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Richard Webber (PVM): You never give an extra minute.

484
00:23:08,717 --> 00:23:11,538
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Richard Webber (PVM): You're comfortable and arrogant, and it doesn't impress me.

485
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:13,442
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Richard Webber (PVM): You want to be chief?

486
00:23:13,461 --> 00:23:13,942
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Richard Webber (PVM): Earn it.

487
00:23:44,751 --> 00:23:47,596
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): I'm sorry.

488

495
00:24:13,795 --> 00:24:14,634
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey (PVM): Maybe it's a tumor.

496
00:24:15,076 --> 00:24:16,278
Meredith Grey / Alex Kreb (PVM): You wish I had a tumor.

497
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:18,882
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): Look, I'd rip your face off if it meant I got to scrub in.

498
00:24:19,362 --> 00:24:20,942

500
00:24:23,548 --> 00:24:24,627

501
00:24:24,949 --> 00:24:28,452
George O'Malley / Alex Kreb OR Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): At least you get to practice freaking medicine.

502
00:24:28,472 --> 00:24:29,875
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): I had to send my Chinese lady away.

503

504
00:24:32,557 --> 00:24:35,102

506
00:24:36,202 --> 00:24:40,548
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): So the police say they can't send a crime scene guy down for hours.

507
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:42,672
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): So I have to spend the night with a penis.

508
00:24:44,373 --> 00:24:45,712

509
00:24:46,173 --> 00:24:47,214

510
00:24:50,357 --> 00:24:52,358
George O'Malley / Alex Kreb OR Patient (PVM): Who here feels like they have no idea what they're doing?

511
00:24:55,063 --> 00:24:56,963
Izzie Stevens / Patient (PVM): I mean, are we supposed to be learning something?

512
00:24:56,983 --> 00:24:58,444
Izzie Stevens / Patient (PVM): Because I don't feel like I'm learning anything.

513
00:24:58,704 --> 00:24:59,747
George O'Malley / Meredith Grey (PVM): Except how not to sleep.

514
00:24:59,925 --> 00:25:10,297
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): You know, it's like there's this wall, and the attendings and the residents are over there being surgeons, and we're over here being... Suturing, code running, lab delivering, penis minders.

515
00:25:10,317 --> 00:25:11,576

525
00:26:11,656 --> 00:26:13,440

526
00:26:14,101 --> 00:26:14,961

527
00:26:16,364 --> 00:26:18,404

535
00:26:36,134 --> 00:26:39,377

536
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,640
Another doctor / Meredith Grey (PVM): No, sir.
