Dr. Meredith Grey began her first day as a surgical intern at Seattle Grace Hospital, reflecting on the daunting challenges ahead. Dr. Richard Webber addressed the new interns, warning them that their seven years of residency would be both the best and worst of their lives, and that many would not make it through. Meredith faced immediate awkwardness with Dr. Derek Shepherd, her attending surgeon, after they spent the previous night together. Meredith insisted they pretend it never happened, emphasizing the need for professional boundaries.

Dr. Miranda Bailey introduced Meredith, Cristina Yang, George O'Malley, and Izzie Stevens to their first grueling 48-hour shift, making it clear they were at the bottom of the surgical hierarchy. As the group navigated the hospital, they bantered about Meredith's famous mother, Ellis Grey, and the pressures of living up to a renowned legacy. Meredith visited Ellis, who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and struggled with the emotional distance between them.

Searching for roommates, Meredith interviewed several applicants, including George and Izzie. Both tried to persuade her with promises of cleanliness and quiet, but Meredith hesitated, preferring strangers she wouldn't have to interact with. Despite her reservations, she began to consider George and Izzie as potential roommates.

Dr. Bailey assigned tasks to the interns: George was put in charge of the code team, Meredith took the trauma pager, Cristina was responsible for delivering labs, and Izzie was assigned to sutures. The interns competed for opportunities to assist in surgery, but Bailey reminded them their primary job was to keep her happy, not to hold scalpels.

Meredith and Derek spoke about Seattle's ferry boats, with Derek flirting and Meredith insisting they maintain professional boundaries and not repeat their previous night together. Their conversation revealed Meredith's reluctance to settle in Seattle.

A trauma case arrived when a 25-year-old rape victim named Allison was brought in with severe injuries. Meredith and other doctors coordinated Allison's care, noting her resilience. During the examination, they discovered Allison had bitten off her attacker's penis, shocking the team. Meredith was tasked with maintaining custody of the severed organ until the police arrived.

Dr. Addison Montgomery, a new attending, discussed her recent move from New York to Seattle, revealing she had been recruited by Chief Webber. Tensions simmered between Dr. Preston Burke and Webber over surgical assignments and the arrival of Shepherd.

George and Izzie discussed the responsibilities of the code team, while Cristina teased George about his optimism. The interns interacted with a lab technician delivering results, and Cristina claimed Alex Karev as her shadow for the day. Alex's abrasive attitude annoyed Meredith, who expressed her dislike for him.

George led a code in the ER, revealing his inexperience and anxiety. Izzie treated Mrs. Liu, a patient who did not speak English, and struggled to communicate with her. Meredith continued to safeguard the severed penis from the rape case, and the interns joked about the bizarre responsibility.

Dr. Bailey diagnosed a patient with a rare but minor disorder, reassuring them they did not need surgery and would be discharged. The interns discussed the severed penis, with Cristina explaining its origin and the chain of custody rules.

Meredith was deeply affected by Allison's case, noticing they wore the same shoes that day, which made her reflect on the randomness of trauma. She confided in her colleagues about feeling tired and overwhelmed.

Izzie discovered a baby with a heart murmur and confronted the attending physician, who dismissed her concerns. Izzie persisted and sought help from Dr. Burke, who initially refused to intervene without a consult. After Meredith advocated for the baby's care, Burke agreed to run tests but warned Meredith against going behind other doctors' backs.

Mrs. Liu, fearing deportation, resisted treatment for her wound. Izzie reassured her, promising not to report her status, and treated her outside the hospital, risking her own job. Mrs. Liu was grateful, and Izzie gave her instructions for follow-up care.

The team operated on Allison, but her prognosis remained uncertain. The rapist was brought into the hospital, and the staff discussed the impossibility of reattaching his penis due to the nature of the injury. Dr. Bailey explained the consequences for the attacker, and the interns reflected on the brutality of the case.

Burke and Webber argued about surgical assignments and leadership, with Bailey challenging Burke to earn the position of chief by going beyond the minimum requirements. Alex apologized to Izzie for his earlier behavior.

The interns gathered, exhausted and doubting their abilities. George lamented losing five patients on the code team, feeling like the angel of death, and Cristina comforted him by explaining the realities of code patients. Meredith, Izzie, and George discussed the divide between interns and attendings, feeling isolated from the real practice of medicine.

Meredith finally decided to let George and Izzie move in as her roommates, admitting she needed connection despite her desire for boundaries. The group celebrated, and Meredith reflected on the importance of crossing lines rather than drawing them.

As the episode ended, Meredith and Derek shared a quiet moment, acknowledging the complexity of their relationship and the risks of crossing professional boundaries. Meredith concluded that while boundaries can protect, they can also isolate, and sometimes taking risks leads to spectacular outcomes.
