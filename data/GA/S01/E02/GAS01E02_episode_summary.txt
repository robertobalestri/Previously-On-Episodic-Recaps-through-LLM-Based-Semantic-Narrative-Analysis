At Seattle Grace Hospital, Dr. Richard Webber addressed the incoming class of surgical interns, warning them that residency would be both the best and worst time of their lives, and that not everyone would be able to withstand the pressure. Among the new interns were Dr. Meredith Grey, Dr. Cristina Yang, Dr. Izzie Stevens, Dr. George O'Malley, and Dr. Alex Karev. As the group prepared for their first grueling 48-hour shift, Dr. Miranda Bailey introduced herself as their resident and made it clear that they were at the very bottom of the hospital hierarchy. She assigned George to run the code team, Meredith to handle the trauma pager, Cristina to deliver labs, and Izzie to sutures, emphasizing that their job was to keep her happy by doing the grunt work.

Meredith and Dr. Derek Shepherd, an attending surgeon, struggled with the aftermath of their one-night stand. Meredith insisted they pretend it never happened, since Derek was her superior, but Derek's flirtatious attitude made her uncomfortable as she tried to set boundaries. Their awkward dynamic was interrupted when Dr. Webber asserted his authority as chief of surgery.

Meanwhile, the interns gossiped about Meredith's background, revealing that her mother was the renowned surgeon Ellis Grey. Meredith was searching for roommates, and both Cristina and Izzie expressed interest in moving in, while George was desperate to leave his parents' house. Though hesitant, Meredith eventually agreed to let them move in.

As the interns began their duties, they eagerly sought surgical opportunities but quickly learned that Dr. Bailey expected them to focus on menial tasks. Izzie and Alex competed to finish their patient rounds faster, while George grew frustrated by the emotional toll of running the code team, where most patients could not be revived.

A trauma case soon arrived: a 25-year-old rape victim named Allison. Alex and Cristina led the response, and the interns discovered that Allison had fought back fiercely, biting off her attacker's penis, which Meredith identified in a specimen jar. The rape kit was negative, confirming Allison had successfully defended herself. The brutality of the case left the interns shaken.

Elsewhere, Izzie struggled to communicate with a Chinese-speaking patient, Mrs. Liu, and sought help from Cristina, who revealed she was Korean and did not speak Chinese. The language barrier complicated Mrs. Liu's care, and Mrs. Liu's fear of being reported as undocumented made her reluctant to enter the hospital. Meredith, Izzie, and George promised not to report her and treated her wound outside, with Meredith giving her a card to return for follow-up care.

Tensions among the hospital's attendings surfaced when Dr. Preston Burke confronted Dr. Webber about bringing Derek Shepherd to Seattle Grace, feeling threatened about his own chances of becoming chief of surgery. Webber criticized Burke for only doing what was necessary and challenged him to earn the position.

During her rounds, Meredith noticed a baby in the pediatric ward with a heart murmur and tried to get Dr. Burke to check on him. Burke refused without a consult from Pediatrics, citing hospital rules. Meredith later went behind the pediatrician's back to alert the baby's parents, leading to a confrontation between services. Burke ultimately took over the case, ordered tests, and confirmed a congenital heart defect, scheduling surgery for the next day. He sternly warned Meredith never to undermine another doctor again.

Meanwhile, the police searched for Allison's attacker, knowing he would eventually need medical attention. When the rapist was brought into the hospital, severely injured, the surgical team determined that reattaching his penis was impossible due to the nature of the injury. Dr. Bailey delivered the news that he would be incontinent and impotent for life.

The episode also highlighted the loneliness of patients like Allison, who had no family in Seattle. The interns reflected on their own support systems and the importance of having people who care. Izzie and George bonded over the difficulties of their day, with Izzie confessing to kissing another doctor, Eric, in the elevator, and the two joked about the absurdity of their lives as interns.

At the end of the episode, Meredith decided to let George and Izzie move in with her, breaking her own rule about keeping boundaries. The interns celebrated, and Cristina teased Meredith about becoming soft. Meredith reflected on the importance and limitations of boundaries, realizing that while they can protect, they can also isolate. She acknowledged that sometimes, crossing lines is necessary for growth and connection. The episode closed with Meredith and Derek sharing a quiet moment, the tension and attraction between them unresolved, as Meredith contemplated the risks and rewards of crossing personal and professional boundaries.
