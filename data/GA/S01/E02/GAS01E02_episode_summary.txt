**Episode Summary:**

The episode opens with Meredith's narration about the challenges and high attrition rate of surgical residency, establishing the theme of boundaries—both professional and personal. Meredith and Derek awkwardly navigate the aftermath of their night together, agreeing to keep their relationship secret due to Derek's position as her superior. Dr. Bailey firmly assigns the interns their duties, making it clear that none will operate until she is satisfied with their performance.

Meredith is approached by Izzie and George about becoming roommates, but she is initially reluctant and interviews other candidates, ultimately rejecting them and her fellow interns. The interns express frustration at being kept from surgeries, but Bailey reminds them their job is to please her, not to operate.

A major trauma case arrives: Allison, a young woman who fought off her attacker, is brought in with severe injuries. During surgery, Meredith discovers Allison bit off her attacker's penis, which she must now keep in her custody for the police. The case emotionally affects Izzie, who relates to Allison through their shared shoes, while Cristina and Alex Karev—newly introduced as her shadow—immediately clash over their competitive natures.

George, leading a code team, loses a patient and is shaken by the experience. Izzie struggles to communicate with Mrs. Lu, a patient who speaks only Chinese, and is recognized from her modeling days. Meredith and Cristina bond over the stress of the day and Meredith's secret kiss with Derek in the elevator, reinforcing their friendship.

Security brings in a man with a severe groin injury, revealed to be Allison's attacker. The surgical team determines his penis cannot be reattached, ensuring lasting consequences for his crime. Meanwhile, Dr. Burke confronts the chief about his own prospects for chief of surgery, feeling threatened by Derek's recruitment. The chief challenges Burke to prove himself worthy.

Izzie discovers Mrs. Lu is undocumented and afraid to seek care. She treats Mrs. Lu outside the hospital and arranges a secret follow-up, demonstrating her compassion and willingness to bend rules for patients. Meredith's instincts about a baby's heart murmur are validated when Burke confirms the defect and schedules surgery, but he warns her not to bypass protocol again.

The interns gather, sharing their doubts and exhaustion, feeling unprepared for the realities of surgical life. Cristina questions Burke about her own confidence, and George confides in her about the emotional toll of losing patients. Meredith and George bond over their shared anxieties and family issues while sitting with the unconscious Allison.

Derek and Meredith continue to navigate their complicated relationship, with Meredith insisting on boundaries despite their mutual attraction. Allison's condition deteriorates, requiring emergency brain surgery, and her prognosis remains uncertain.

Burke and Derek acknowledge their rivalry for chief of surgery but agree not to view each other as enemies. Meredith completes the chain-of-custody paperwork for the severed penis, marking the end of the traumatic case. Burke invites Meredith to assist in the baby's heart surgery, giving her a coveted opportunity to operate.

The episode concludes with Meredith deciding to let Izzie and George move in, symbolizing her willingness to cross personal boundaries. She reflects on the risks and rewards of crossing lines, both in medicine and life, as she chooses to take the stairs instead of the elevator with Derek, acknowledging her struggle with self-control. Meredith's closing narration ties together the episode's themes of boundaries, risk, and the potential for spectacular outcomes.
