At Seattle Grace Hospital, Meredith Grey began her first day as a surgical intern, her thoughts narrating the immense pressure and challenges that awaited her and her fellow interns. Dr. Richard Webber, the Chief of Surgery, addressed the new group, warning them about the grueling nature of their residency and the high rate of failure among interns. Meredith and Dr. Derek Shepherd, her attending surgeon, exchanged awkward words about their one-night stand, with Meredith insisting they pretend it never happened because of their professional relationship.

Dr. Miranda Bailey, the strict resident supervisor, introduced herself to the interns—Meredith, Cristina Yang, Izzie Stevens, George O'Malley, and Alex Karev. She assigned them to a demanding 48-hour shift and made it clear that they were at the bottom of the hospital hierarchy, needing to prove themselves before being allowed near an operating table.

As the day unfolded, the interns discussed Meredith's background, revealing that her mother was the renowned surgeon Ellis Grey. Away from the hospital, Meredith visited her mother, who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease in a care facility. The interns bonded over their anxieties and the daunting expectations placed upon them, with Meredith reflecting on the importance of maintaining boundaries with colleagues.

Meredith also spent time interviewing potential roommates for her house. Izzie tried to convince her by promising to be quiet and responsible, while George admitted that his mother still ironed his scrubs. Though initially reluctant, Meredith eventually agreed to let both Izzie and George move in.

Back at the hospital, Dr. Bailey assigned specific duties to each intern: George was put in charge of the code team, Meredith took the trauma pager, Cristina was tasked with delivering lab results, and Izzie was assigned to sutures. The interns competed for opportunities to assist in surgeries, but Bailey reminded them that no one would hold a scalpel until she was satisfied with their work.

Meredith and Derek continued to navigate their complicated relationship, exchanging flirtatious banter while Meredith insisted on keeping things professional. The interns joked about the need to draw lines between their personal and professional lives.

A rape victim named Allison arrived in the emergency room with severe injuries. Derek and Meredith took charge of her care, coordinating her treatment and preparing her for scans. The interns were shocked to learn that Allison had bitten off her attacker's penis during the assault. Meredith was given the responsibility of maintaining the chain of custody for the severed organ until the police arrived.

Meanwhile, Izzie struggled to communicate with a non-English-speaking patient, Mrs. Liu, who feared being reported due to her immigration status. Izzie and Meredith promised to help her without jeopardizing her safety, ultimately treating her wound outside the hospital to avoid legal complications.

Cristina and Alex competed to deliver lab results and see patients as quickly as possible, each trying to prove their competence. George, overwhelmed by his responsibilities on the code team, lost several patients and felt like the “angel of death.” Cristina reassured him that most code patients could not be revived and that it was not his fault.

Meredith noticed a baby in the nursery with a heart murmur and brought it to Dr. Burke's attention. Although Dr. Burke initially refused to intervene without a consult from pediatrics, he eventually agreed to run tests and confirmed a congenital heart defect that required surgery. Meredith was warned not to overstep her boundaries again.

The rapist, severely injured, was brought into the hospital. The surgical team, including Bailey, Shepherd, Burke, and the interns, discussed the impossibility of reattaching his penis due to the extent of the injury. They operated to save his life, but he would suffer permanent consequences.

Throughout the exhausting shift, the interns supported each other through their emotional turmoil and reflected on the challenges of being new doctors. Meredith, Cristina, and Izzie discussed the loneliness of patients like Allison, who had no family in Seattle, and compared it to their own experiences.

By the end of the episode, Meredith decided to let Izzie and George move in with her, realizing that boundaries sometimes keep out people who should be let in. Meredith and Derek shared a moment, hinting at the ongoing tension between them. Meredith reflected on the importance of taking risks and crossing lines, concluding that while some boundaries are necessary, others are meant to be challenged.
