1
00:00:01,246 --> 00:00:02,849
Previously on Grey's Anatomy.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,637
The seven years you spend here as a surgical resident will be the best and worst of your life.

3
00:00:07,677 --> 00:00:09,320
You will be pushed to the breaking point.

4
00:00:09,461 --> 00:00:12,066
Eight of you will switch to an easier specialty.

5
00:00:12,086 --> 00:00:13,888
Five of you will crack under the pressure.

6
00:00:13,968 --> 00:00:15,170
Two of you will be asked to leave.

7
00:00:15,672 --> 00:00:17,635
Dr. Shepherd, we should pretend it never happened.

8
00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:18,556
What never happened?

9
00:00:18,577 --> 00:00:19,780
You sleeping with me last night?

10
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,161
Or are you throwing me out this morning?

11
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:23,265
You're an attending, and I'm your intern.

12
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:25,367
Stop looking at me like that.

13
00:00:25,586 --> 00:00:26,088
Like what?

14
00:00:26,347 --> 00:00:27,349
Like you've seen me naked.

15
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,053
Your first shift starts now and lasts 48 hours.

16
00:00:31,373 --> 00:00:36,520
You're interns, grunts, nobodies, bottom of the surgical food chain.

17
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:37,280
What are you doing here?

18
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:40,325
You and I are going to have so much fun together.

19
00:00:40,344 --> 00:00:42,326
You know Meredith is inbred?

20
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:45,570
Like it's uncommon around here to be a doctor's parent.

21
00:00:45,591 --> 00:00:46,292
No, royally inbred.

22
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:47,412
Her mother is Alice Gray.

23
00:00:47,453 --> 00:00:48,494
Shut up, the Alice Gray.

24
00:00:48,594 --> 00:00:49,595
She's a living ledger.

25
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:52,472
What's your name?

26
00:00:52,491 --> 00:00:53,533
It's me, Mom.

27
00:00:53,552 --> 00:01:00,843
Meredith.

28
00:01:00,862 --> 00:01:09,075
All right.

29
00:01:09,174 --> 00:01:15,382
We're gonna survive this, right?

30
00:01:15,403 --> 00:01:17,906
It's all about lines.

31
00:01:18,628 --> 00:01:21,051
The finish line at the end of residency...

32
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:25,292
Waiting in line for a chance at the operating table.

33
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:30,920
And then there's the most important line.

34
00:01:32,102 --> 00:01:35,085
A line separating you from the people you work with.

35
00:01:39,191 --> 00:01:41,734
It doesn't help to get too familiar.

36
00:01:43,477 --> 00:01:47,763
To make friends.

37
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,174
You need boundaries between you and the rest of the world.

38
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:58,325
Other people are far too messy.

39
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:01,469
It's all about lines.

40
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:04,534
Drawing lines in the sand.

41
00:02:05,635 --> 00:02:08,000
And praying like hell no one crosses them.

42
00:02:09,222 --> 00:02:14,189
Look, I'm sure you're very nice, but I'm very particular about who lives in my house and you're just not right.

43
00:02:14,237 --> 00:02:14,699
Why?

44
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,260
Look, I'm quiet.

45
00:02:16,622 --> 00:02:18,664
No loud music, no parties.

46
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:20,247
Where were you when the Challenger exploded?

47
00:02:21,088 --> 00:02:21,930
The what?

48
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:22,711
The space shuttle.

49
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:23,492
Challenger.

50
00:02:24,334 --> 00:02:25,536
Uh, I think I was in kindergarten.

51
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:27,258
Exactly.

52
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,020
No.

53
00:02:29,622 --> 00:02:31,906
Why do you put up posters for roommates if you don't want roommates?

54
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:32,907
I do want roommates.

55
00:02:32,948 --> 00:02:34,349
We're together 100 hours a week.

56
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,532
You want to live together, too?

57
00:02:35,852 --> 00:02:36,593
Oh, yeah.

58
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,514
See, you bring bribes down, huh?

59
00:02:37,534 --> 00:02:38,395
I need a place to live.

60
00:02:38,417 --> 00:02:40,058
My mom irons my scrubs.

61
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:41,241
I have to get out of there.

62
00:02:41,525 --> 00:02:42,406
It's not a bribe.

63
00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:43,546
I don't think it's a good idea.

64
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:45,268
I can put down last, first, and deposit.

65
00:02:45,288 --> 00:02:45,748
It's totally a bribe.

66
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,009
I can cook.

67
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:48,390
And I'm an obsessive cleaner.

68
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:48,891
No.

69
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:52,835
I just want two total strangers who I don't have to talk to or be nice to.

70
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:54,176
And it's not a bribe.

71
00:02:54,296 --> 00:02:55,377
It's a mocha latte.

72
00:02:55,957 --> 00:02:57,659
George, you're running the code team.

73
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,140
Meredith, take the trauma pager.

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,824
Christina, deliver the weekend labs to the patients.

75
00:03:01,843 --> 00:03:02,784
Izzy, you're on sutures.

76
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:09,550
Dr. Bailey, I was hoping to assist you in the OR today, maybe do a minor procedure.

77
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:10,771
I think I'm ready.

78
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:11,998
Mocha latte?

79
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,241
If she gets a cut, I want a cut too.

80
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:14,722
Yeah, me too.

81
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:15,843
I wouldn't mind another shot.

82
00:03:15,883 --> 00:03:16,824
I mean, if everybody else is.

83
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:17,405
Stop talking.

84
00:03:18,826 --> 00:03:21,210
Every intern wants to perform their first surgery.

85
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,711
That's not your job.

86
00:03:22,951 --> 00:03:23,973
Do you know what your job is?

87
00:03:24,234 --> 00:03:25,555
To make your resident happy.

88
00:03:25,855 --> 00:03:26,896
Do I look happy?

89
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:27,116
No.

90
00:03:27,317 --> 00:03:27,617
Why?

91
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:29,379
Because my interns are whiny.

92
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,262
You know what will make me look happy?

93
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:39,611
Having the code team staffed, having the trauma pages answered, having the weekend labs delivered, and having someone down in the pit doing the sutures.

94
00:03:41,278 --> 00:03:44,723
No one holds a scalpel till I'm so happy I'm Mary freakin' Poppins.

95
00:03:45,664 --> 00:03:46,967
Mogulotting my ass.

96
00:03:47,487 --> 00:03:48,650
Why are you all standing there?

97
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,069
Move!

98
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:02,409
Seattle has ferry boats.

99
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:02,729
Yes.

100
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:03,752
I didn't know that.

101
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:05,234
I've been living here six weeks.

102
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,695
I didn't know there were ferry boats.

103
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,508
Seattle is surrounded by water on three sides.

104
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:12,072
Hence the fairy boats.

105
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:12,973
Now I have to like it here.

106
00:04:13,894 --> 00:04:15,036
I wasn't planning on liking it here.

107
00:04:16,076 --> 00:04:16,718
I'm from New York.

108
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,822
Genetically engineered to dislike everywhere, except Manhattan.

109
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:22,305
I have a thing for fairy boats.

110
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:30,115
I'm not going out with you.

111
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:33,641
Did I ask you to go out with me?

112
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:34,422
Do you want to go out with me?

113
00:04:35,937 --> 00:04:38,661
I'm not dating you, and I'm definitely not sleeping with you again.

114
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,742
You're my boss.

115
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:41,144
I'm your boss's boss.

116
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:44,589
You're my teacher, and my teacher's teacher, and you're my teacher.

117
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,451
I'm your sister.

118
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:46,072
I'm your daughter.

119
00:04:46,512 --> 00:04:47,634
You're sexually harassing me.

120
00:04:47,694 --> 00:04:50,459
I'm riding an elevator.

121
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:52,100
Look, I'm drawing a line.

122
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:53,603
The line is drawn.

123
00:04:53,644 --> 00:05:00,012
There's a big line.

124
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:04,560
So this line, is it imaginary, or do I need to get you a marker?

125
00:05:27,322 --> 00:05:28,023
We'll talk later.

126
00:05:34,232 --> 00:05:34,932
You the surgeon?

127
00:05:34,952 --> 00:05:35,653
Yeah.

128
00:05:35,673 --> 00:05:37,257
We've got a rape victim.

129
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,461
You better get in there.

130
00:05:40,482 --> 00:05:43,425
25-year-old female found down at the park, status post-trauma.

131
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:46,630
She came in with a GCS of 6, BP 80 over 60.

132
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:54,382
Exam is significant for blood head trauma, unequal breath sounds, right pupil is dilated, and she's ready for x-ray.

133
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:55,624
You ready to roll?

134
00:05:58,894 --> 00:06:00,357
Hey.

135
00:06:00,377 --> 00:06:00,617
Yeah.

136
00:06:04,442 --> 00:06:05,464
Call ahead to clear CT.

137
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:06,446
Let them know I'm coming.

138
00:06:06,726 --> 00:06:08,108
Load up the portable monitor.

139
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:10,232
Call respiratory for a ventilator.

140
00:06:10,473 --> 00:06:11,754
I'll get x-rays while I'm down there.

141
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:21,129
She's going to spend a hell of a long time in recovery and rehab.

142
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:22,050
She survives.

143
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:24,639
What is she, like 5'2", 100 pounds?

144
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,622
She's still breathing after what this guy did to her?

145
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:27,903
Catch the guy?

146
00:06:28,084 --> 00:06:29,906
They should castrate him.

147
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:31,488
See how shitty her hands are?

148
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:32,411
She tried to fight back.

149
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,192
Tried to?

150
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,514
Rape kid came back negative.

151
00:06:35,014 --> 00:06:35,795
She kicked his ass.

152
00:06:37,016 --> 00:06:41,463
Oh, so we have a warrior among us, huh?

153
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:41,944
Allison.

154
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:46,310
Her name is Allison.

155
00:06:48,714 --> 00:06:50,617
Allison.

156
00:06:50,637 --> 00:06:51,379
I think I've met her.

157
00:06:51,528 --> 00:06:52,668
on the cause of our rupture.

158
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:57,175
What is this?

159
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,865
Does anyone know what this is?

160
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:07,447
Oh, my god.

161
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:08,408
What?

162
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:09,050
Spit it out, Gray.

163
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,552
She bit it off.

164
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:11,512
Bit off what?

165
00:07:11,892 --> 00:07:15,437
That's his penis.

166
00:07:17,701 --> 00:07:20,403
She bit off his penis.

167
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:46,526
Ouch.

168
00:07:46,545 --> 00:07:57,903
If she can fight the infection, she'll be fine.

169
00:07:57,923 --> 00:08:00,987
It's all gonna depend on whether or not she wakes up in the next 72 hours.

170
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:06,709
Yeah, we should get a drink later and tell me the long story of what makes a hot shot doc leave the Big Apple for Seattle.

171
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,732
It's a short story, actually.

172
00:08:08,752 --> 00:08:11,696
Your chief of surgery made me an offer I couldn't refuse.

173
00:08:12,295 --> 00:08:13,057
Richard asked you to come?

174
00:08:14,057 --> 00:08:15,120
Yeah.

175
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:15,339
Why?

176
00:08:17,302 --> 00:08:17,641
Oh, nothing.

177
00:08:18,923 --> 00:08:19,303
See you later.

178
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:28,814
Do you know what the code team does?

179
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:30,848
Saves lives.

180
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,293
Eyes shock a heart, and someone lives to see another day.

181
00:08:35,134 --> 00:08:35,816
That's upbeat.

182
00:08:36,277 --> 00:08:38,360
It's, um, glass half full.

183
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:40,945
Bambi, don't say another word till after the hunter shoots your mother.

184
00:08:40,985 --> 00:08:44,610
I don't like you.

185
00:08:45,652 --> 00:08:46,352
I have a B.A.

186
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:47,654
from Smith, a Ph.D.

187
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:49,057
from Berkeley, and an M.D.

188
00:08:49,097 --> 00:08:51,400
from Stanford, and I'm delivering lab results.

189
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:52,643
It's gonna take me all day to get through these.

190
00:08:53,384 --> 00:08:54,886
Then get started.

191
00:08:55,322 --> 00:08:56,565
Oh, I wasn't complaining.

192
00:08:56,725 --> 00:08:57,385
I don't complain.

193
00:08:57,426 --> 00:08:59,710
Intern was reassigned, so he's mine now.

194
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,272
Have him shadow you for the day.

195
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:02,894
You show him how I do things.

196
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:06,340
Alex Kreb.

197
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,041
Nice to meet you.

198
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:08,984
The figure who called Meredith a nurse.

199
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:10,025
Yeah.

200
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:11,528
I hate you on principle.

201
00:09:11,548 --> 00:09:13,671
And you're the pushy, overbearing kiss-ass.

202
00:09:13,691 --> 00:09:15,094
I, uh, I hate you too.

203
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:16,655
Oh, it should be fun then.

204
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:29,942
I'm Dr. O'Malley.

205
00:09:29,982 --> 00:09:31,105
I'll be running this code.

206
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:31,626
What do we got?

207
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,390
We have a 57-year-old male.

208
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:34,594
See you, sisterly.

209
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,922
We're charging you 200, please.

210
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:39,743
We're charged.

211
00:09:39,763 --> 00:09:40,003
Cleared.

212
00:09:40,864 --> 00:09:42,705
All right, Mrs. Liu, I'm Dr. Stevens.

213
00:09:43,265 --> 00:09:44,447
I'm gonna sew up your wound.

214
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,629
You're gonna need, yeah, about six stitches.

215
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:48,331
Are you allergic to any medication?

216
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:54,636
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't, I don't, um... Do you speak English?

217
00:09:55,739 --> 00:10:07,230
I'll find, um... Does anybody here speak Chinese?

218
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:17,153
Hi.

219
00:10:17,173 --> 00:10:18,115
Is the chief in?

220
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:18,797
He's on his way.

221
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:19,938
Is that it?

222
00:10:20,801 --> 00:10:21,964
Yeah.

223
00:10:21,984 --> 00:10:22,544
Can I see it?

224
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:25,110
No.

225
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:25,792
Forget I asked.

226
00:10:26,413 --> 00:10:27,755
Meredith, it's good to see you.

227
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:29,879
Hey, I heard your mother was leaving the mail.

228
00:10:30,081 --> 00:10:31,403
She going back with the UN?

229
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:33,869
She's taking time off.

230
00:10:33,989 --> 00:10:35,412
Writing another book, I suppose.

231
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,063
Listen, so they said to bring this to you, so?

232
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:42,028
Yes, for the police.

233
00:10:42,048 --> 00:10:42,169
Right.

234
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,250
When did the police say they were coming?

235
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,015
You know how slow they are, so she'd better take it with her.

236
00:10:46,496 --> 00:10:46,697
What?

237
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:48,801
You have to take it with you.

238
00:10:50,244 --> 00:10:51,285
Chain of custody rules.

239
00:10:51,726 --> 00:10:56,796
All medical matter in a rape must stay with the person who collected it until it's placed into police custody.

240
00:10:56,816 --> 00:11:00,302
You collected the specimen, so you have custody.

241
00:11:00,501 --> 00:11:01,543
Custody of a penis?

242
00:11:01,923 --> 00:11:03,926
Yes, until the cops come for it.

243
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:04,485
OK.

244
00:11:05,307 --> 00:11:06,808
Well, what am I supposed to do with a penis?

245
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:14,417
You have a disorder called multinucleic cell angio-histiocytoma.

246
00:11:14,777 --> 00:11:16,379
It's not a cancer or sarcoma.

247
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,101
It's a very rare but minor.

248
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,323
You'll be discharged today, OK?

249
00:11:22,024 --> 00:11:24,086
I don't need a surgery?

250
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:24,167
No.

251
00:11:24,187 --> 00:11:25,067
I'm not going to die.

252
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:26,149
I'm fine.

253
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:27,471
Fit as a fiddle or whatever.

254
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:43,327
What's that?

255
00:11:43,347 --> 00:11:43,828
Don't ask.

256
00:11:43,849 --> 00:11:44,551
You don't want to know.

257
00:11:44,591 --> 00:11:45,793
I do want to know.

258
00:11:45,832 --> 00:11:46,794
Really.

259
00:11:47,296 --> 00:11:48,057
You really want to know?

260
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:50,623
It's a severed penis.

261
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:52,767
OK.

262
00:11:53,388 --> 00:11:55,149
Well, I didn't really want to know.

263
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:56,572
Why do I have to be the one who gets hugged?

264
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:58,072
Because I don't do that.

265
00:11:58,273 --> 00:12:00,014
Besides, you're the ovarian sister here.

266
00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:01,437
Did you just call me an ovarian?

267
00:12:01,456 --> 00:12:02,418
An ovarian?

268
00:12:03,298 --> 00:12:05,422
Because when does that possession of ovaries become an insult?

269
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,624
Married is carrying a penis around in a jar.

270
00:12:08,504 --> 00:12:09,446
Oh, from the rape surgery?

271
00:12:09,785 --> 00:12:11,567
Yeah, and it's not a jar.

272
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:12,448
It's a cooler.

273
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:17,455
Talk about taking a bite out of crime.

274
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,049
You OK?

275
00:12:26,272 --> 00:12:26,491
Yeah.

276
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:28,874
Allison's shoes are.

277
00:12:29,453 --> 00:12:32,557
What?

278
00:12:32,576 --> 00:12:34,259
The rape victim, Allison, her shoes.

279
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:37,081
I have the same ones in my locker.

280
00:12:37,302 --> 00:12:39,583
And I normally never wear them because they're not comfortable.

281
00:12:39,984 --> 00:12:40,804
But today I did.

282
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:44,128
And she was wearing the same shoes.

283
00:12:44,187 --> 00:12:46,870
And it's just stupid.

284
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:47,811
And I'm tired.

285
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:48,831
And forget it.

286
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,014
You know what you need?

287
00:12:56,855 --> 00:12:57,235
No.

288
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:01,120
It's sick and twisted.

289
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,081
We said last time was the last time.

290
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:07,006
You've been doing it without me?

291
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:08,707
Nancy Reagan lied.

292
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:10,791
You can't just say no.

293
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:11,892
Come on.

294
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:13,514
Do you know what would happen if anyone knew?

295
00:13:14,174 --> 00:13:14,654
I'm doing it.

296
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:20,701
You can come with me, or you can stay here and be miserable.

297
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:30,157
You are such a woman.

298
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:32,339
That's a code.

299
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:39,264
Yeah, I got it.

300
00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:55,379
You are really cute.

301
00:14:20,302 --> 00:14:35,306
What are you doing in here?

302
00:14:35,326 --> 00:14:38,350
The, uh, there were no tests ordered, and the baby has a murmur.

303
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:39,373
I know.

304
00:14:40,855 --> 00:14:41,755
He turned blue.

305
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,317
Your surgery, you're not authorized to be in here.

306
00:14:44,558 --> 00:14:46,480
Do you know how much trouble you can get into for this?

307
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,942
Are you going to do any tests?

308
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:50,644
It's a benign systolic ejection murmur.

309
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:51,725
It goes away with age.

310
00:14:51,745 --> 00:14:52,686
So you're not going to do tests?

311
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,447
He's not your patient.

312
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:54,768
He's not even on your service.

313
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,350
Are you sure it's benign?

314
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,711
I'm a doctor, too, you know.

315
00:14:58,792 --> 00:14:59,592
You should get out of here.

316
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:08,922
Dr. Palmer, agent of the pharmacy.

317
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:10,942
You get a good kiss?

318
00:15:11,101 --> 00:15:11,783
No, her.

319
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:13,927
She won't let me sew her up.

320
00:15:15,028 --> 00:15:21,378
I wouldn't have called you, but I can't get hold of the translator.

321
00:15:21,398 --> 00:15:22,679
Can you just ask her what's wrong?

322
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,245
No.

323
00:15:28,388 --> 00:15:28,808
Why not?

324
00:15:31,753 --> 00:15:33,115
Because I grew up in Beverly Hills.

325
00:15:33,154 --> 00:15:35,678
The only Chinese I know is from a Mr. Chow's menu.

326
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:38,503
Besides, I'm Korean.

327
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:51,374
Chief, so you asked Shepherd to come to Grace?

328
00:15:52,134 --> 00:15:53,855
He's an old student of mine.

329
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:53,976
Oh.

330
00:15:54,437 --> 00:15:56,599
Well, he left a Manhattan private practice because you asked.

331
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,620
Yes.

332
00:15:58,601 --> 00:15:59,101
No other reason?

333
00:16:00,102 --> 00:16:01,365
Just a favor for an old professor?

334
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:03,407
It'll be years before I retire.

335
00:16:03,506 --> 00:16:05,729
Chief, the surgery is mine.

336
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:07,051
Chief, the surgery is mine.

337
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:07,711
It was yours.

338
00:16:07,772 --> 00:16:08,673
Now I'm not so sure.

339
00:16:08,712 --> 00:16:12,196
I am the best surgeon at Grace with the lowest mortality rate.

340
00:16:12,216 --> 00:16:13,498
You can't just bring some guy here for me.

341
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,460
Now ask me why I'm not so sure about you.

342
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,442
Ask me what?

343
00:16:21,462 --> 00:16:23,205
OB nurse to labor and delivery.

344
00:16:23,745 --> 00:16:29,432
Available over the doorstep.

345
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:30,873
Don't people get sick anymore?

346
00:16:30,893 --> 00:16:38,841
I mean, how are we supposed to get any of our time if everyone's gonna just live?

347
00:16:38,861 --> 00:16:42,304
Look, I'll take ten, you take ten.

348
00:16:42,686 --> 00:16:43,485
Get in, get out.

349
00:16:43,506 --> 00:16:45,649
No smiling, no hugging, no letting them cry.

350
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:46,830
Just be quick about it.

351
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:48,975
You're the one that's slow.

352
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:49,937
I am not slow.

353
00:16:49,996 --> 00:16:50,677
You are slow.

354
00:16:50,697 --> 00:16:51,238
You want to bet?

355
00:16:51,918 --> 00:16:52,440
Yeah, you are.

356
00:16:54,662 --> 00:16:55,562
A comprehensive workup.

357
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,625
Did not reveal any vascular abnormalities.

358
00:16:57,645 --> 00:16:58,706
Your Doppler was negative.

359
00:16:58,787 --> 00:17:03,131
For deep venous thrombosis, so there's no need for chronic anticoagulation or an IBC filter.

360
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:04,673
Your biopsy was, however, positive.

361
00:17:04,693 --> 00:17:05,894
For a mixed anaerobics.

362
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:07,576
Non-group-based streptococci infection.

363
00:17:07,718 --> 00:17:10,000
Your BUN and creatinine elevations had us worried.

364
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:11,863
About rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.

365
00:17:11,903 --> 00:17:13,845
Which could have signaled an autoimmune disease.

366
00:17:13,944 --> 00:17:14,826
What does that mean?

367
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,298
We're not going to amputate your leg.

368
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:17,278
Huh?

369
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:18,340
You get to keep your kidneys.

370
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,343
Congratulations.

371
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:20,825
You can go home today.

372
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:21,566
Yeah, yeah.

373
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,267
Congratulations.

374
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:22,627
Whatever.

375
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:28,477
Congratulations.

376
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:29,759
There's nothing wrong with you.

377
00:17:29,778 --> 00:17:30,500
You're going to be fine.

378
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:31,741
Congratulations.

379
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,030
What's your favorite age group?

380
00:17:37,652 --> 00:17:38,732
Queen.

381
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:38,933
No.

382
00:17:39,654 --> 00:17:40,336
Twisted Sister.

383
00:17:40,756 --> 00:17:41,116
Oh.

384
00:17:41,755 --> 00:17:43,916
Not like there's a right or wrong answer to that question.

385
00:17:44,057 --> 00:17:47,161
Yeah, the Go-Go's, Duran Duran, Eurythmics.

386
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,243
Have a nice day.

387
00:17:50,263 --> 00:17:53,627
You can go home today.

388
00:17:53,647 --> 00:18:07,002
Time of death, 1545.

389
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:27,614
Remember, call every hospital in the county.

390
00:18:28,935 --> 00:18:34,041
Sooner or later, the guy that did this is gonna seek medical attention, and when he does, that penis you're carrying around's gonna nail it.

391
00:18:34,982 --> 00:18:36,064
Where is her family?

392
00:18:36,104 --> 00:18:36,825
Doesn't have any.

393
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:38,165
No siblings?

394
00:18:39,366 --> 00:18:39,528
No.

395
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:40,969
Both parents are dead.

396
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:43,432
She just moved to Seattle three weeks ago.

397
00:18:44,252 --> 00:18:45,394
Welcome to the city.

398
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:54,275
Meredith, you OK?

399
00:18:55,696 --> 00:18:57,198
Yeah, I'm fine.

400
00:18:57,258 --> 00:18:59,539
I just have to do something.

401
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:01,221
I have to go.

402
00:19:02,663 --> 00:19:03,844
All right, I'm going to sit with her.

403
00:19:03,864 --> 00:19:06,006
Dr. Burke, there's a baby up in Peds.

404
00:19:06,026 --> 00:19:08,749
I saw him have his head fell, and I think I hear a murmur.

405
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,770
Did Peds call us for a consult?

406
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:11,531
Actually, no.

407
00:19:11,571 --> 00:19:12,491
They're not doing anything about it.

408
00:19:12,512 --> 00:19:13,113
So you want me to what?

409
00:19:13,532 --> 00:19:14,795
If you could just go up and look at him.

410
00:19:14,855 --> 00:19:16,175
Not without a Peds consultant.

411
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:18,478
I'm a busy man, Gray, and there are rules.

412
00:19:18,498 --> 00:19:20,460
Look, it's not like I'm the chief or something.

413
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:28,770
Dr. Palmer, page the box.

414
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:32,337
Dr. Palmer, page the box.

415
00:19:32,357 --> 00:19:34,000
You're hot.

416
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,481
You're drunk.

417
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:35,143
Hold still.

418
00:19:38,308 --> 00:19:43,900
Wait, you're that girl from the magazine, that red bikini?

419
00:19:44,622 --> 00:19:45,323
Yeah, it was Pink.

420
00:19:45,603 --> 00:19:45,903
I'm done.

421
00:19:45,923 --> 00:19:47,545
You can see the nurse outside now.

422
00:19:47,865 --> 00:19:50,028
Is she crazy or something?

423
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:52,570
No, I don't think so.

424
00:19:55,213 --> 00:19:55,314
Okay.

425
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:56,715
Please, please sit down.

426
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,057
I really need to look at your arm.

427
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:00,240
Okay.

428
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:06,627
When I left her, she was very young.

429
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:12,974
It wasn't a good place, but we got the money.

430
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,108
What are you doing down here?

431
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,031
Just sitting here with my penis.

432
00:20:25,532 --> 00:20:26,032
What about you?

433
00:20:26,554 --> 00:20:27,295
Hiding from Alex.

434
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,124
I kissed Eric.

435
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:33,663
You kissed Eric?

436
00:20:34,204 --> 00:20:34,986
In the elevator.

437
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:36,548
Well, you kissed him in the elevator.

438
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,211
I was having a bad day.

439
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:41,375
I am having a bad day.

440
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:44,000
So what do you do on your bad days?

441
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:45,662
Make out with Dr. McDreamy?

442
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:54,255
You know, that and carrying around a penis just makes everything seem so shiny and happy.

443
00:20:54,876 --> 00:20:56,221
George said Allison was wearing your shoes.

444
00:20:57,064 --> 00:20:57,424
Yeah.

445
00:20:58,808 --> 00:20:59,570
It's weird, right?

446
00:21:01,195 --> 00:21:02,098
It's weird that you care.

447
00:21:03,943 --> 00:21:04,967
I think it's weird.

448
00:21:30,512 --> 00:21:31,615
Can I have security, please?

449
00:21:36,227 --> 00:21:43,785
What do we got?

450
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:44,046
Take a look.

451
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:45,268
Let's get them to OR1.

452
00:21:45,308 --> 00:21:48,015
Meredith, you call the chief and let him know we got the rapist.

453
00:22:02,575 --> 00:22:05,780
I saw Allison.

454
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,684
You can't believe the beating that she took.

455
00:22:08,185 --> 00:22:09,067
And then to see this.

456
00:22:09,407 --> 00:22:11,332
It's like that old saying, you should see the other guy.

457
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,896
Why are we not attempting to reattach the severed penis?

458
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,338
Teeth don't slice, they tear.

459
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:16,942
You can only reattach with a clean cut.

460
00:22:17,222 --> 00:22:18,846
She wanted to slice him off with a knife.

461
00:22:19,028 --> 00:22:22,250
Besides, the digestive juices didn't leave much of the flesh to work with.

462
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:22,852
Right.

463
00:22:22,872 --> 00:22:23,571
So what do we do?

464
00:22:23,913 --> 00:22:25,634
Sew him up minus a large part of the family jewels.

465
00:22:26,055 --> 00:22:26,915
And his outlook?

466
00:22:27,415 --> 00:22:30,118
He'll be urinating out of a bag for a very, very long time.

467
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,759
Not to mention he'll never be able to have sex again.

468
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:32,601
Oh, too bad.

469
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,342
Shane.

470
00:22:33,362 --> 00:22:34,782
Let's all take a moment to grieve.

471
00:22:35,463 --> 00:22:41,230
Clamp.

472
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:41,569
Richard.

473
00:22:43,271 --> 00:22:44,112
We got the rapist.

474
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,434
He stumbled right into the hospital.

475
00:22:47,095 --> 00:22:47,736
Yeah, I heard.

476
00:22:50,855 --> 00:22:51,455
Listen, Bert.

477
00:22:51,715 --> 00:22:52,016
Why?

478
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:53,698
You really want to know?

479
00:22:54,358 --> 00:22:56,382
I want to know when you stop thinking of me as your number one.

480
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,548
Richard, I do more in this hospital than any other surgeon you have.

481
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:04,310
You do only exactly as much as is necessary.

482
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,294
You never take an extra step.

483
00:23:06,493 --> 00:23:07,714
You never give an extra minute.

484
00:23:08,717 --> 00:23:11,539
You're comfortable and arrogant, and it doesn't impress me.

485
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,442
You want to be chief?

486
00:23:13,461 --> 00:23:13,942
Earn it.

487
00:23:44,752 --> 00:23:47,596
I'm sorry.

488
00:23:47,615 --> 00:23:49,038
I have patients lined up.

489
00:23:49,117 --> 00:23:49,759
I don't have time.

490
00:23:49,838 --> 00:23:51,019
I don't understand you.

491
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:52,521
I'm sorry.

492
00:23:52,541 --> 00:24:01,392
Dr. Bailey to ortho staff.

493
00:24:01,571 --> 00:24:05,936
Dr. Bailey to ortho staff.

494
00:24:05,997 --> 00:24:13,545
My head hurts.

495
00:24:13,795 --> 00:24:14,635
Maybe it's a tumor.

496
00:24:15,076 --> 00:24:16,278
You wish I had a tumor.

497
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:18,882
Look, I'd rip your face off if it meant I got to scrub in.

498
00:24:19,362 --> 00:24:20,943
I've been suturing all day.

499
00:24:20,963 --> 00:24:23,126
My hands are numb.

500
00:24:23,548 --> 00:24:24,628
At least you're helping people.

501
00:24:24,949 --> 00:24:28,453
At least you get to practice freaking medicine.

502
00:24:28,473 --> 00:24:29,875
I had to send my Chinese lady away.

503
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,519
She was, like, camped out down there.

504
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:35,102
Oh, poor Izzy, turning away a patient.

505
00:24:35,122 --> 00:24:36,183
Boo hoo.

506
00:24:36,203 --> 00:24:40,548
So the police say they can't send a crime scene guy down for hours.

507
00:24:40,568 --> 00:24:42,672
So I have to spend the night with a penis.

508
00:24:44,373 --> 00:24:45,713
Alex, don't say it.

509
00:24:46,174 --> 00:24:47,215
Oh, it's too easy anyway.

510
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:52,359
Who here feels like they have no idea what they're doing?

511
00:24:55,063 --> 00:24:56,964
I mean, are we supposed to be learning something?

512
00:24:56,984 --> 00:24:58,445
Because I don't feel like I'm learning anything.

513
00:24:58,705 --> 00:24:59,747
Except how not to sleep.

514
00:24:59,926 --> 00:25:10,297
You know, it's like there's this wall, and the attendings and the residents are over there being surgeons, and we're over here being... Suturing, code running, lab delivering, penis minders.

515
00:25:10,317 --> 00:25:11,577
I hate being an intern.

516
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:44,336
Hi.

517
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:48,000
Hi.

518
00:25:50,923 --> 00:25:52,423
Is he yours?

519
00:25:52,444 --> 00:25:53,325
Yeah.

520
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:59,171
He's adorable.

521
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:03,173
Thanks.

522
00:26:03,193 --> 00:26:04,194
Oh, please.

523
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:07,992
You are so out of line.

524
00:26:09,153 --> 00:26:10,655
She says the murmur might not be benign.

525
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:13,440
I think we should do an echo to check.

526
00:26:14,101 --> 00:26:14,961
This is your career.

527
00:26:16,364 --> 00:26:18,405
There really is no reason to get along.

528
00:26:20,008 --> 00:26:20,709
What's the problem?

529
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:24,733
If our baby is sick, we want him treated now.

530
00:26:25,295 --> 00:26:26,256
Who said your baby was sick?

531
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:29,079
Her, the surgical intern who has no business on our service.

532
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,741
Who authorized you being here?

533
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:34,487
I was just actually... Hey, dude.

534
00:26:34,507 --> 00:26:35,228
Could you excuse me for a second?

535
00:26:36,135 --> 00:26:39,378
Are you messing with my intern, Dr. K?

536
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,640
No, sir.

537
00:26:41,461 --> 00:26:41,922
Give me the check.

538
00:26:42,061 --> 00:26:42,923
There's nothing wrong with him.

539
00:26:42,982 --> 00:26:43,343
I checked.

540
00:26:43,363 --> 00:26:43,763
Are you sure?

541
00:26:43,784 --> 00:26:44,003
Yes.

542
00:26:46,046 --> 00:26:47,067
You can guarantee that he's fine.

543
00:26:47,086 --> 00:26:48,228
You're 100% sure.

544
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,290
How sure are you?

545
00:26:51,951 --> 00:26:52,752
I don't know, 75%.

546
00:26:53,353 --> 00:26:54,755
Not good enough.

547
00:26:54,775 --> 00:26:55,615
He's my patient now.

548
00:26:56,056 --> 00:26:57,076
That okay with you, Dr. K?

549
00:26:57,636 --> 00:26:58,178
Absolutely.

550
00:26:59,098 --> 00:26:59,920
We can take our patient.

551
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:00,780
He's an attending.

552
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,222
Which means I can do whatever I want.

553
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:07,875
Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, I'm Dr. Burke, head of cardio.

554
00:27:08,676 --> 00:27:12,563
We're going to run some tests and get you an answer within the hour.

555
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:12,823
Great.

556
00:27:13,304 --> 00:27:14,005
Excuse me.

557
00:27:15,105 --> 00:27:18,951
I want an EKG, chest x-ray, and an echo.

558
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:19,814
I don't have all day.

559
00:27:20,273 --> 00:27:20,954
You're a busy man.

560
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:25,722
I'm a busy man.

561
00:27:25,742 --> 00:27:26,384
Anybody else?

562
00:27:27,025 --> 00:27:27,164
No.

563
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:28,006
No more.

564
00:27:28,026 --> 00:27:28,847
Then I need a bed.

565
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:31,352
Ms.

566
00:27:31,392 --> 00:27:31,692
Liu?

567
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,076
Dr. Cutlin, thoracic surgery.

568
00:27:39,096 --> 00:27:48,357
Dr. Frank Cutlin, thoracic surgery.

569
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:48,577
Ms.

570
00:27:48,617 --> 00:27:49,038
Liu!

571
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:49,901
Ms.

572
00:27:49,922 --> 00:27:50,482
Liu, wait!

573
00:27:50,663 --> 00:27:50,763
Ms.

574
00:27:50,784 --> 00:27:51,044
Liu!

575
00:27:52,346 --> 00:27:53,088
What is it?

576
00:28:03,126 --> 00:28:25,133
It's okay.

577
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:25,353
It's okay.

578
00:28:25,373 --> 00:28:25,573
I'll help.

579
00:28:43,053 --> 00:28:43,634
It's deep.

580
00:28:44,476 --> 00:28:44,816
It's deep.

581
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:45,979
I need to clean it out.

582
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:47,300
Clean it.

583
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,305
Machine is broken in the factory.

584
00:28:49,325 --> 00:28:49,664
It's gone.

585
00:28:50,247 --> 00:28:51,127
Can you speak English?

586
00:28:52,411 --> 00:28:53,893
Just, if you could come inside.

587
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:55,316
No, no, not inside.

588
00:28:55,336 --> 00:28:56,278
No, no, no.

589
00:28:56,337 --> 00:28:56,719
Jail.

590
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,201
Jail?

591
00:28:58,561 --> 00:29:00,266
She came inside.

592
00:29:00,286 --> 00:29:00,346
No.

593
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:01,387
She been caught.

594
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:02,789
Me, no.

595
00:29:03,932 --> 00:29:04,773
You're illegal.

596
00:29:05,597 --> 00:29:06,239
That's okay.

597
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:07,401
We don't have to tell them that.

598
00:29:07,421 --> 00:29:08,982
I just need to get you inside.

599
00:29:09,002 --> 00:29:10,384
I have to sew that up.

600
00:29:10,404 --> 00:29:11,267
No, no inside.

601
00:29:11,606 --> 00:29:12,347
Please, I promise.

602
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:14,392
I promise you won't go to jail.

603
00:29:14,511 --> 00:29:15,373
It's raining.

604
00:29:15,393 --> 00:29:18,877
Please, come inside.

605
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:20,641
Okay, okay, okay.

606
00:29:21,603 --> 00:29:22,203
Not inside.

607
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,913
Wait here, okay?

608
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:29,153
Wait.

609
00:29:29,213 --> 00:29:29,775
I'll come back.

610
00:29:29,815 --> 00:29:30,896
I'll be back.

611
00:29:37,103 --> 00:29:37,403
Well?

612
00:29:38,044 --> 00:29:38,806
It's a birth defect.

613
00:29:39,326 --> 00:29:41,209
Tetralogy of a lower pulmonary atresia.

614
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:41,931
You were right.

615
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,593
Book an OR for tomorrow.

616
00:29:44,374 --> 00:29:46,076
Thank you for backing me up on this.

617
00:29:46,116 --> 00:29:47,660
No, no, no, wait.

618
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,160
You were right.

619
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:57,474
But if you ever pull a stunt like that again, going to the parents behind a doctor's back, trying to steal a patient from another service, I will make your residency here hell on earth.

620
00:30:15,763 --> 00:30:28,843
I came home in the morning and everything was gone.

621
00:30:29,143 --> 00:30:31,306
Oh, what have I done?

622
00:30:33,048 --> 00:30:37,674
I dropped dead in the hallway, cursing the dawn.

623
00:30:38,476 --> 00:30:42,362
Oh, come on, son, why must I burn?

624
00:30:43,844 --> 00:31:03,912
I'm just trying to learn.

625
00:31:18,184 --> 00:31:23,872
Okay, you're all sewn up.

626
00:31:23,892 --> 00:31:24,813
That's pretty good.

627
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:28,557
I could have done a better job if I'd had more light.

628
00:31:29,838 --> 00:31:30,720
You might have a scar.

629
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:32,362
It's good.

630
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:40,832
You're gonna need to come back in five days, okay?

631
00:31:40,872 --> 00:31:44,817
I'm gonna need to check the wound and remove the stitches, okay?

632
00:31:46,686 --> 00:31:49,771
Here's my pager number on this card.

633
00:31:50,232 --> 00:31:50,593
Right here.

634
00:31:51,193 --> 00:31:51,473
Okay?

635
00:31:52,055 --> 00:31:53,738
We'll meet right back here.

636
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:54,479
Okay?

637
00:31:54,819 --> 00:31:55,820
You have to come back.

638
00:31:56,923 --> 00:32:00,929
But you can't tell anybody that I helped you outside of the hospital or I might lose my job.

639
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,151
Understand?

640
00:32:02,892 --> 00:32:03,192
Yes.

641
00:32:03,252 --> 00:32:04,934
Come back and don't tell.

642
00:32:05,536 --> 00:32:05,777
Yes.

643
00:32:07,138 --> 00:32:07,398
Okay.

644
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,039
That's it.

645
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:08,381
I'm done.

646
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:09,102
You can go.

647
00:32:10,183 --> 00:32:11,184
I'll see you in five days.

648
00:32:11,826 --> 00:32:12,406
Yes, Eel.

649
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:25,957
She is my only family here.

650
00:32:26,739 --> 00:32:32,914
You are a good person and a good doctor.

651
00:32:32,934 --> 00:32:33,436
Thank you.

652
00:32:35,561 --> 00:32:35,843
Thank you.

653
00:32:35,863 --> 00:32:36,183
Thank you.

654
00:32:57,123 --> 00:33:06,017
Do you think I'm too confident?

655
00:33:06,657 --> 00:33:08,801
No.

656
00:33:10,064 --> 00:33:14,510
Don't lie.

657
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,772
You are my boss.

658
00:33:19,111 --> 00:33:20,112
All right, then.

659
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:22,753
Anything you say in the next 30 seconds is free, starting now.

660
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:27,818
I think you're cocky.

661
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:30,181
Arrogant, bossy, and pushy.

662
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:31,882
You also have a God complex.

663
00:33:31,902 --> 00:33:33,824
You never think about anybody but your damn self.

664
00:33:34,044 --> 00:33:35,025
But I... But what?

665
00:33:35,045 --> 00:33:36,346
I still have 22 more seconds.

666
00:33:36,365 --> 00:33:36,967
I'm not done.

667
00:33:39,729 --> 00:33:42,991
I need a drink, a man, or a massage.

668
00:33:43,011 --> 00:33:47,236
I've already drunk a massage by a man.

669
00:33:48,115 --> 00:33:48,797
What's wrong with you?

670
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,762
I lost five patients on the code team today.

671
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,886
I feel like the angel of death.

672
00:33:57,048 --> 00:34:00,113
George, 95% of all code patients can't be revived.

673
00:34:00,473 --> 00:34:02,316
Most of them are seriously dead before you can get there.

674
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:07,403
What?

675
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:11,751
Why didn't you tell me that when I was going on and on about how great it was gonna be?

676
00:34:11,771 --> 00:34:12,371
Because.

677
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:32,318
His heart surgery is scheduled for the morning.

678
00:34:32,338 --> 00:34:33,961
I really did think I was right, you know?

679
00:34:35,143 --> 00:34:35,483
I know.

680
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,231
We almost never are.

681
00:34:41,233 --> 00:34:41,974
We're interns.

682
00:34:42,574 --> 00:34:43,777
We're not supposed to be right.

683
00:34:44,717 --> 00:34:46,701
And when we are, it's completely shocking.

684
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:53,090
Are you... I mean, being an intern, do you feel...

685
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,541
Terrified, 100% of the time.

686
00:34:58,844 --> 00:34:59,045
Good.

687
00:34:59,085 --> 00:34:59,905
It's not just me.

688
00:35:02,068 --> 00:35:02,307
No.

689
00:35:21,447 --> 00:35:22,047
How is she?

690
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,400
No change.

691
00:35:25,563 --> 00:35:27,385
Have you been here all night?

692
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,791
Mm-hmm.

693
00:35:30,811 --> 00:35:32,072
Yeah.

694
00:35:32,092 --> 00:35:33,034
You know I have four sisters?

695
00:35:33,954 --> 00:35:35,177
Very girly, tons of kids.

696
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:36,820
If I was in a coma, they'd all be here.

697
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:38,282
I'd want them here.

698
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:40,465
Not having no one?

699
00:35:41,987 --> 00:35:42,688
Can't imagine that.

700
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:44,190
I can.

701
00:35:45,152 --> 00:35:45,693
What are you talking about?

702
00:35:45,713 --> 00:35:46,293
What about your mother?

703
00:35:47,655 --> 00:35:49,639
She'd be here ordering all the surgeons around.

704
00:35:49,905 --> 00:35:53,871
She'd fly these cowboys in from Prague to do these amazing medical procedures.

705
00:35:55,634 --> 00:35:56,074
That's true.

706
00:35:57,014 --> 00:35:59,018
I do have my mother.

707
00:35:59,277 --> 00:36:04,465
So we're kissing, but we're not dating?

708
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:07,769
I knew that was gonna come up.

709
00:36:07,809 --> 00:36:10,373
Don't get me wrong, I like the kissing.

710
00:36:10,393 --> 00:36:11,193
I'm all for the kissing.

711
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:13,197
Or kissing, I say.

712
00:36:14,121 --> 00:36:15,684
I have no idea what that was about.

713
00:36:15,824 --> 00:36:17,987
It's gonna happen again, because if it is, I need to bring breath mints.

714
00:36:19,989 --> 00:36:20,911
But I can't in a moment.

715
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:21,172
Shut up now.

716
00:36:22,954 --> 00:36:24,916
There's this baby up in the nursery.

717
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,661
He's brand new.

718
00:36:29,423 --> 00:36:31,246
No one's neglected him or damaged him yet.

719
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,952
How did we get from there to here?

720
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,838
She's wearing my shoes, and someone's beat the crap out of her.

721
00:36:41,181 --> 00:36:42,222
And she's got nobody.

722
00:36:49,204 --> 00:36:50,306
Your ICP's double.

723
00:36:50,326 --> 00:36:51,067
Get O.R.

724
00:36:51,487 --> 00:36:53,590
Perfect for craniotomy.

725
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:54,552
Let's hang a medical.

726
00:36:54,572 --> 00:36:55,813
Uh, take a blood gas.

727
00:37:07,048 --> 00:37:08,731
Dr. Cutler to thoracic surgery.

728
00:37:09,532 --> 00:37:17,342
Dr. Frank Cutler to thoracic surgery.

729
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:17,742
I, uh...

730
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,224
Had to leave her skull flap off until the pressure in her brain goes down.

731
00:37:23,487 --> 00:37:24,670
She's not going to make it, is she?

732
00:37:25,851 --> 00:37:29,518
She's going to be fine.

733
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,498
If she ever wakes up.

734
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:40,135
If she ever wakes up.

735
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:41,797
Dr. Burke, I'm off at 6.

736
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:42,920
Want to get that drink we talked about?

737
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:43,880
I don't think so.

738
00:37:44,621 --> 00:37:45,603
Well, what about tomorrow night?

739
00:37:47,947 --> 00:37:50,670
Shepard, you should know that Richard promised Chief to both of us.

740
00:37:56,335 --> 00:37:57,297
But you knew that already.

741
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,981
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.

742
00:38:03,063 --> 00:38:03,784
You're not the enemy.

743
00:38:04,806 --> 00:38:05,786
You're just a competition.

744
00:38:12,414 --> 00:38:16,518
So here is where you have the signature, and down here, the initials.

745
00:38:16,887 --> 00:38:23,818
It just says that the, um, the... Penis.

746
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:24,559
I'm a doctor.

747
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:26,222
I mean, it shouldn't be weird to say this.

748
00:38:26,324 --> 00:38:29,068
It's just that I used to change her diapers.

749
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:30,670
I get it.

750
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,293
It just says that it was never on his side.

751
00:38:32,313 --> 00:38:33,014
There you go.

752
00:38:33,034 --> 00:38:33,635
It wasn't a penis.

753
00:38:36,922 --> 00:38:38,625
Officer.

754
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:47,072
We'll be using a median approach for a transventricular repair with a right ventriculotomy.

755
00:38:47,974 --> 00:38:48,375
Let's open him up.

756
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,617
Moki, 15 blade, please.

757
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:53,862
Gray.

758
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:55,483
Yes, sir.

759
00:38:56,445 --> 00:38:57,005
Go scrub in.

760
00:38:57,266 --> 00:38:59,909
When we're finished cracking the baby's chest, I'll let you hold the clamp.

761
00:39:01,753 --> 00:39:02,193
Seriously?

762
00:39:03,835 --> 00:39:05,016
Don't make me change my mind.

763
00:39:05,818 --> 00:39:06,199
I'm going.

764
00:39:14,514 --> 00:39:15,456
Good news and bad news.

765
00:39:15,956 --> 00:39:17,778
The good news is Dr. Bailey stops your bleeding.

766
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:21,483
The bad news is we're giving your penis to the cops.

767
00:39:21,503 --> 00:39:22,284
Have a nice life.

768
00:39:26,487 --> 00:39:28,469
The results of your labs are clean.

769
00:39:28,489 --> 00:39:29,431
The tumor is benign.

770
00:39:29,452 --> 00:39:37,079
You can go home today.

771
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:59,672
At some point, you have to make a decision.

772
00:40:02,336 --> 00:40:04,760
Boundaries don't keep other people out.

773
00:40:05,581 --> 00:40:08,686
They fence you in.

774
00:40:09,898 --> 00:40:14,626
Life is messy.

775
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:15,487
That's how we're made.

776
00:40:16,409 --> 00:40:20,353
Okay, fine, George and Izzy, you can move into the house.

777
00:40:21,596 --> 00:40:22,356
Yes!

778
00:40:22,376 --> 00:40:24,501
I can't believe it!

779
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:24,960
Yes!

780
00:40:24,981 --> 00:40:25,722
Thank you.

781
00:40:26,704 --> 00:40:27,063
Yes!

782
00:40:29,206 --> 00:40:30,429
I can't believe I caved.

783
00:40:31,451 --> 00:40:33,072
I blame the babies.

784
00:40:33,092 --> 00:40:35,777
They make you toxic.

785
00:40:35,797 --> 00:40:39,061
So, you can waste your life drawing lines,

786
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:53,855
Or you can live your life crossing them.

787
00:40:56,619 --> 00:40:57,422
Welcome back.

788
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:22,617
But there are some lines... So... It's intense.

789
00:41:23,978 --> 00:41:27,864
This thing I have for fairy boats, I mean.

790
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:31,088
...that are way too dangerous to cross.

791
00:41:31,108 --> 00:41:33,192
I'm so taking the stairs this time.

792
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:36,717
No self-control.

793
00:41:36,737 --> 00:41:37,358
It's sad.

794
00:41:37,398 --> 00:41:38,900
Really.

795
00:41:49,612 --> 00:41:50,574
Here's what I know.

796
00:41:53,882 --> 00:42:08,753
If you're willing to take the chance, the view from the other side is spectacular.
