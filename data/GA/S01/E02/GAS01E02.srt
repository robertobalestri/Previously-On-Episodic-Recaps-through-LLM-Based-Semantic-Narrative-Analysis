1
00:00:00,101 --> 00:00:01,916
Previously on "Grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,161 --> 00:00:06,581
The 7 years you spend here as a surgical resident will be the best and worst of your life.

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:08,198
You will be pushed to the breaking point.

4
00:00:08,265 --> 00:00:10,794
Eight of you will switch to an easier specialty.

5
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:12,734
Five of you will crack under the pressure.

6
00:00:12,796 --> 00:00:14,220
Two of you will be asked to leave.

7
00:00:14,357 --> 00:00:16,391
Dr. Shepherd, we should pretend it never happened.

8
00:00:16,456 --> 00:00:18,623
What never happened -- you sleeping with me last night,

9
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:19,985
or you throwing me out this morning?

10
00:00:20,066 --> 00:00:22,407
You're an attending, and I'm your intern.

11
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,397
Stop looking at me like that.

12
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:25,155
Like what?

13
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:26,426
Like you've seen me naked.

14
00:00:26,514 --> 00:00:30,071
Your first shift starts now and lasts 48 hours.

15
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:34,572
You're interns, grunts, nobodies, bottom of the surgical food chain.

16
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:36,293
What are you doing here?

17
00:00:36,487 --> 00:00:38,740
You and I are gonna have so much fun together.

18
00:00:40,164 --> 00:00:41,515
You know Meredith is inbred?

19
00:00:41,673 --> 00:00:44,059
Like it's uncommon around here to be a doctor's parents.

20
00:00:44,136 --> 00:00:46,143
No, royally inbred. Her mother is Ellis Grey.

21
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:47,387
Shut up. The Ellis Grey?

22
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,585
She's a living legend.

23
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,012
What's your name?

24
00:00:51,294 --> 00:00:53,137
It's me, mom -- Meredith.

25
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,269
All right.

26
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,305
We're gonna survive this, right?

27
00:01:14,106 --> 00:01:16,080
It's all about lines.

28
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,587
The finish line at the end of residency.

29
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:24,497
Waiting in line for a chance at the operating table.

30
00:01:27,113 --> 00:01:30,027
And then there's the most important line --

31
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:34,220
the line separating you from the people you work with.

32
00:01:38,697 --> 00:01:40,768
It doesn't help to get too familiar.

33
00:01:44,555 --> 00:01:45,648
To make friends.

34
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,397
You need boundaries between you and the rest of the world.

35
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,332
Other people are far too messy.

36
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,496
It's all about lines.

37
00:02:02,037 --> 00:02:03,537
Drawing lines in the sand

38
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:07,106
and praying like hell no one crosses them.

39
00:02:08,022 --> 00:02:09,632
Look, I'm sure you're very nice,

40
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:13,077
but I'm very particular about who lives in my house, and you're just not right.

41
00:02:13,163 --> 00:02:17,347
Why? Look, I'm quiet. No loud music, no parties.

42
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,457
Where were you when the challenger exploded?

43
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:20,649
The what?

44
00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:22,657
The space shuttle challenger.

45
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:24,750
Uh... I think I was in kindergarten.

46
00:02:25,277 --> 00:02:27,213
Exactly. No.

47
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:30,756
Why do you put up posters for roommates if you don't want roommates?

48
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,183
I do want roommates. We're together 100 hours a week.

49
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:34,581
You want to live together, too?

50
00:02:34,913 --> 00:02:36,536
I see you bring bribes now, huh?

51
00:02:36,898 --> 00:02:40,228
My mom irons my scrubs. I have to get out of there.

52
00:02:40,336 --> 00:02:42,429
It's not a bribe. I don't think it's a good idea.

53
00:02:42,486 --> 00:02:45,011
- I can put down last, first, and deposit.
- It's totally a bribe.

54
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:47,407
I can cook, and I'm an obsessive cleaner.

55
00:02:47,488 --> 00:02:50,714
No. I just want two total strangers who I don't have to talk to

56
00:02:50,786 --> 00:02:54,446
or be nice to, and it's not a bribe. It's a mocha latte.

57
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,995
George, you're running the code team. Meredith, take the trauma pager.

58
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,212
Christina, deliver the weekend labs to the patients.

59
00:03:00,335 --> 00:03:01,865
Izzie, you're on sutures.

60
00:03:02,941 --> 00:03:06,868
Dr. Bailey, I was hoping to assist you in the O.R. Today.

61
00:03:06,944 --> 00:03:09,898
Maybe, do a minor procedure, I think I'm ready. 

62
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:11,020
Mocha latte?

63
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,601
- If she gets to cut, I want to cut, too.
- Yeah, me too.

64
00:03:13,703 --> 00:03:15,478
I wouldn't mind another shot. I mean, if everybody else is...

65
00:03:15,555 --> 00:03:16,739
Stop talking.

66
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:20,170
Every intern wants to perform their first surgery.

67
00:03:20,252 --> 00:03:21,706
That's not your job.

68
00:03:21,823 --> 00:03:24,568
Do you know what your job is? To make your resident happy.

69
00:03:24,691 --> 00:03:28,453
Do I look happy? No. Why? Because my interns are whiny.

70
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,406
You know what will make me look happy?

71
00:03:30,697 --> 00:03:33,825
Having a code team staffed, having the trauma pages answered,

72
00:03:33,887 --> 00:03:38,489
having the weekend labs delivered, and having someone down in the pit, doing the sutures.

73
00:03:40,114 --> 00:03:43,895
No one holds a scalpel till I'm so happy, I'm mary freakin' poppins.

74
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:46,159
Mocha latte, my ass.

75
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:48,223
Why are y'all standing there? Move!

76
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,502
Seattle has ferryboats.

77
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:01,902
Yes.

78
00:04:02,031 --> 00:04:02,902
I didn't know that.

79
00:04:03,055 --> 00:04:04,228
I've been living here six weeks.

80
00:04:04,336 --> 00:04:05,558
I didn't know there were ferryboats.

81
00:04:05,947 --> 00:04:08,604
Seattle is surrounded by water on three sides.

82
00:04:08,677 --> 00:04:09,767
Hence the ferryboats.

83
00:04:10,828 --> 00:04:12,189
Now I have to like it here.

84
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,171
I wasn't planning on liking it here.

85
00:04:14,918 --> 00:04:15,947
I'm from New York.

86
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:19,014
I'm genetically engineered to dislike everywhere except Manhattan.

87
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:21,328
I have a thing for ferryboats.

88
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:28,738
I'm not going out with you.

89
00:04:28,906 --> 00:04:30,314
Did I ask you to go out with me?

90
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,657
Do you want to go out with me?

91
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,667
I'm not dating you, and I'm definitely not sleeping with you again.

92
00:04:37,738 --> 00:04:38,548
You're my boss.

93
00:04:38,641 --> 00:04:39,859
I'm your boss's boss.

94
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:42,566
You're my teacher and my teacher's teacher.

95
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:43,647
And you're my teacher.

96
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,096
"I'm your sister, I'm your daughter."

97
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:47,789
- You're sexually harassing me.
- I'm riding an elevator.

98
00:04:49,171 --> 00:04:51,250
Look, I'm drawing a line.

99
00:04:51,496 --> 00:04:52,751
The line is drawn.

100
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:55,116
There's a big line.

101
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:03,717
So, this line, is it imaginary or do I need to get you a marker?

102
00:05:26,215 --> 00:05:27,274
We'll talk later?

103
00:05:33,123 --> 00:05:34,191
-  Are you the surgeon?
- Yeah.

104
00:05:34,546 --> 00:05:36,429
- We've got a rape victim.
- Better get in there.

105
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:42,482
25-year-old  female found down at the park. Status -- post trauma.

106
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:45,778
She came in with a gcs of six. B.P. -- 80 over 60.

107
00:05:46,735 --> 00:05:49,179
Exam  is significant for blunt head trauma.

108
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:53,474
Unequal breath sounds, right pupil is dilated, and she's ready for x-ray.

109
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:54,595
Ready to roll?

110
00:05:57,682 --> 00:05:58,343
Hey!

111
00:05:58,919 --> 00:05:59,689
Yeah.

112
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,496
Call ahead to clear a C.T. Let them know I'm coming.

113
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:07,124
Load up the portable monitor.

114
00:06:07,442 --> 00:06:09,249
Call respiratory for a ventilator.

115
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,806
I'll get x-rays while I'm down there.

116
00:06:16,684 --> 00:06:19,699
She's gonna spend a hell of a long time in recovery and rehab.

117
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,974
If she survives.

118
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:23,637
What is she, like 5'2", 100 pounds?

119
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,766
She's still breathing after what this guy did to her?

120
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:27,993
If they catch the guy, they should castrate him.

121
00:06:28,695 --> 00:06:30,252
See how shredded her hands are?

122
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:31,572
She tried to fight back.

123
00:06:31,706 --> 00:06:33,744
Tried to? Rape kit came back negative.

124
00:06:33,824 --> 00:06:34,977
She kicked his ass.

125
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:38,336
So, we have a warrior among us, huh?

126
00:06:40,088 --> 00:06:41,019
Allison.

127
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:45,356
Her -- her name is Allison.

128
00:06:47,348 --> 00:06:48,202
Allison.

129
00:06:49,473 --> 00:06:51,945
I think I may have found the cause of our rupture.

130
00:06:52,104 --> 00:06:52,877
More suction.

131
00:07:00,704 --> 00:07:01,592
What is this?

132
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:03,906
Does anyone know what this is?

133
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,594
Oh, my god.

134
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:08,268
What? Spit it out, Grey.

135
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,680
- She bit it off.
- Bit off what?

136
00:07:10,766 --> 00:07:14,099
That's his... penis.

137
00:07:16,445 --> 00:07:18,344
She bit off his -- his penis.

138
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:51,109
If she can fight the infection, she'll be fine.

139
00:07:51,225 --> 00:07:54,385
It's all gonna depend on whether or not she wakes up in the next 72 hours.

140
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,653
Yo, we should get a drink later.

141
00:07:56,761 --> 00:08:00,191
You can tell me the long story of what makes a hotshot doc leave the big apple for Seattle.

142
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,855
Short story, actually.

143
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,300
Your chief of surgery made me an offer I couldn't refuse.

144
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,637
Richard asked you to come?

145
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:08,875
Yeah. Why?

146
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:11,206
Oh, nothing.

147
00:08:12,106 --> 00:08:12,924
See you later.

148
00:08:20,574 --> 00:08:22,136
Do you know what the code team does?

149
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,464
Saves lives.

150
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:27,931
I shock a heart, and someone lives to see another day.

151
00:08:28,336 --> 00:08:29,365
That's upbeat.

152
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:31,653
It's a glass half full --

153
00:08:31,735 --> 00:08:34,567
Bambi, don't say another word till after the hunter shoots your mother.

154
00:08:36,968 --> 00:08:38,187
I don't like you.

155
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:41,484
I have a B.A. from Smith, a PHD from Berkeley,

156
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:44,699
and an M.D. from Stanford, and I'm delivering lab results.

157
00:08:44,803 --> 00:08:46,220
It's gonna take me all day to get through these.

158
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:47,909
Then get started.

159
00:08:48,626 --> 00:08:49,968
Oh, I wasn't complaining.

160
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,102
Intern was reassigned, so he's mine now.

161
00:08:53,173 --> 00:08:54,890
Have him shadow you for the day.

162
00:08:54,973 --> 00:08:56,527
You show him how I do things.

163
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:00,628
Alex Karev. Nice to meet you.

164
00:09:00,885 --> 00:09:03,064
You're the pig who called Meredith a nurse. Yeah.

165
00:09:03,245 --> 00:09:04,601
I hate you on principle.

166
00:09:04,755 --> 00:09:08,661
And you're the pushy, overbearing kiss-ass. I hate you, too.

167
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:09,951
Oh, it should be fun, then.

168
00:09:22,343 --> 00:09:25,215
I'm Dr. O'malley. I'll be running this code. What do we got?

169
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:27,831
We have a 57-year-old gentleman with asystole.

170
00:09:30,005 --> 00:09:31,783
- Three and four.
- Charging to 200, please.

171
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:33,719
- Charging.
- Cleared.

172
00:09:34,002 --> 00:09:36,207
All right, Mrs. Lu, I'm Dr. Stevens.

173
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:37,949
I'm gonna sew up your wound.

174
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,222
You're gonna need -- yeah -- about six stitches.

175
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:41,758
Are you allergic to any medication?

176
00:09:45,213 --> 00:09:48,404
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't -- Do you speak english?

177
00:09:56,257 --> 00:09:58,474
I'll find, um --

178
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:00,691
Does anybody here speak chinese?

179
00:10:09,703 --> 00:10:11,167
- Hi.
- Is the chief in?

180
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,360
He's on his way.

181
00:10:12,727 --> 00:10:13,543
Is that it?

182
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:14,704
Yeah.

183
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:16,174
Can I see it?

184
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,364
No. Forget I asked.

185
00:10:19,605 --> 00:10:21,315
Meredith, it's good to see you.

186
00:10:21,469 --> 00:10:23,271
Hey, I heard your mother was leaving Mayo.

187
00:10:23,362 --> 00:10:24,997
She going back with the U.N.?

188
00:10:25,523 --> 00:10:27,223
She's, uh, taking time off.

189
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:28,636
To write another book, I suppose.

190
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,557
Listen, so, they said to bring this to you, so --

191
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,505
Yes, uh, for the police.

192
00:10:34,821 --> 00:10:35,429
Right.

193
00:10:35,514 --> 00:10:36,614
When did the police say they were coming?

194
00:10:36,696 --> 00:10:39,599
You know how slow they are, so she better take it with her.

195
00:10:39,711 --> 00:10:40,350
What?

196
00:10:40,935 --> 00:10:42,398
You have to take it with you.

197
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:44,774
Chain-of-custody rules.

198
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:47,279
All medical matter in a rape must stay with the person

199
00:10:47,336 --> 00:10:50,002
who collected it until it's placed into police custody.

200
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:53,489
You collected the specimen, so you have custody.

201
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,113
Custody of a penis.

202
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:57,421
Yes, until the cops come for it.

203
00:10:57,498 --> 00:10:58,216
Okay.

204
00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:00,514
Well, what am I supposed to do with the penis?

205
00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:07,887
You have a disorder called multinucleate cell angiohistiocytoma.

206
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,725
It's not a cancer sarcoma.

207
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,690
It's very rare but minor.

208
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,984
You'll be discharged today, okay?

209
00:11:15,101 --> 00:11:16,283
I don't need a surgery?

210
00:11:16,377 --> 00:11:16,960
No.

211
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,076
I'm not gonna die? I'm fine?

212
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,175
Fit as a fiddle... or whatever.

213
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:36,253
What's that?

214
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,045
Don't ask. You don't want to know.

215
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,273
I do want to know.

216
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:40,430
Really.

217
00:11:40,528 --> 00:11:41,557
You really want to know?

218
00:11:42,797 --> 00:11:44,133
It's a severed penis.

219
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:46,056
Okay.

220
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:48,198
I didn't really want to know.

221
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,908
Why do I have to be the one who gets hugged?

222
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,438
Because -- I don't do that.

223
00:11:51,592 --> 00:11:53,230
Besides, you're the ovarian sister here.

224
00:11:53,306 --> 00:11:55,744
Did you call me an ovarian s-- an ovarian s--

225
00:11:56,461 --> 00:11:58,867
Since when does the possession of ovaries become an insult?

226
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,222
Meredith's carrying a penis around in a jar.

227
00:12:01,607 --> 00:12:02,887
Oh, from the rape surgery?

228
00:12:03,025 --> 00:12:04,940
Yeah, and it's not a jar.

229
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:05,971
It's a cooler.

230
00:12:08,421 --> 00:12:10,756
Talk about taking a bite out of crime.

231
00:12:17,847 --> 00:12:18,606
You okay?

232
00:12:19,414 --> 00:12:20,045
Yeah.

233
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,203
- Allison's shoes are... 
- What?

234
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:27,898
The  rape victim, Allison, her shoes.

235
00:12:28,052 --> 00:12:30,449
I have the same ones in my locker,

236
00:12:30,545 --> 00:12:33,101
and I normally never wear them because they're not comfortable.

237
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:34,405
But today I did.

238
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:38,554
And she was wearing the same shoes, and it's just...

239
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:42,475
stupid, and I'm tired, and forget it.

240
00:12:44,456 --> 00:12:45,630
You know what you need?

241
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:50,908
No.

242
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:54,527
It's sick and twisted.

243
00:12:54,614 --> 00:12:56,668
We said last time was the last time.

244
00:12:58,998 --> 00:13:00,698
You've been doing it without me?

245
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,279
Nancy Reagan lied.

246
00:13:02,996 --> 00:13:04,895
You can't just say no. Come on.

247
00:13:05,106 --> 00:13:07,175
Do you know what would happen if anyone knew?

248
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:08,296
I'm doing it.

249
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,198
You can come with me,

250
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,245
or you can stay here and be miserable.

251
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:27,869
You are such a woman.

252
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:33,164
That's a code.

253
00:13:35,484 --> 00:13:36,400
I got to go.

254
00:13:46,031 --> 00:13:49,134
You are really cute.

255
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,067
What are you doing in here?

256
00:14:21,476 --> 00:14:24,867
The -- there were no tests ordered, and the baby has a murmur.

257
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:25,741
I know.

258
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:28,388
He turned blue.

259
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,857
You're surgery. You're not authorized to be in here.

260
00:14:30,948 --> 00:14:32,802
Do you know how much trouble you can get into for this?

261
00:14:32,888 --> 00:14:34,379
Are you going to do any tests?

262
00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:36,929
It's a benign systolic ejection murmur.

263
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:38,937
- It goes away with age.
- So you're not gonna do tests.

264
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:41,229
He's not your patient. He's not even on your service.

265
00:14:41,322 --> 00:14:42,863
Are you sure it's benign?

266
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:44,752
I'm a doctor, too, you know.

267
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:46,185
You should get out of here.

268
00:14:56,534 --> 00:14:58,407
- You get a good case?
- No -- her.

269
00:14:58,996 --> 00:15:00,481
She won't let me sew her up.

270
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,629
I wouldn't have called you, but I can't get ahold of the translator.

271
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,339
Can you just ask her what's wrong?

272
00:15:13,184 --> 00:15:13,947
No.

273
00:15:14,551 --> 00:15:15,401
Why not?

274
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:19,426
Because I grew up in Beverly Hills.

275
00:15:19,517 --> 00:15:21,909
The only chinese I know is from a Mr. Chow's menu.

276
00:15:21,996 --> 00:15:23,373
Besides, I'm korean.

277
00:15:34,207 --> 00:15:35,051
Chief.

278
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:38,083
So, you asked Shepherd to come to Grace, huh?

279
00:15:38,324 --> 00:15:39,684
He was an old student of mine.

280
00:15:40,203 --> 00:15:43,063
He left a Manhattan private practice because you asked.

281
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,302
Yes.

282
00:15:44,754 --> 00:15:45,620
No other reason?

283
00:15:46,229 --> 00:15:47,924
Just a favor for an old professor?

284
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:51,231
- It'll be years before I retire.
- Chief of surgery is mine.

285
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:53,315
Chief of surgery is mine.

286
00:15:53,397 --> 00:15:55,133
It was yours. Now I'm not so sure.

287
00:15:55,219 --> 00:15:58,384
I am the best surgeon at Grace with the lowest mortality rate.

288
00:15:58,451 --> 00:16:02,147
- You can't just bring -- 
- Now ask me why I'm not so sure about you.

289
00:16:04,662 --> 00:16:05,741
Ask me why.

290
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,427
Don't people get sick anymore?

291
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:22,438
I mean, how are we supposed to get any O.R. time if everyone's gonna just live?

292
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,806
Look.

293
00:16:26,761 --> 00:16:28,833
I'll take 10, you take 10.

294
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:29,821
Get in, get out.

295
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,997
No  smiling, no hugging, no letting them cry.

296
00:16:32,084 --> 00:16:33,170
Just be quick about it.

297
00:16:33,907 --> 00:16:35,261
You're the one that's slow.

298
00:16:35,336 --> 00:16:36,959
I am not slow. You are slow.

299
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,911
You want to bet?

300
00:16:38,172 --> 00:16:39,007
Yeah, you're on.

301
00:16:40,825 --> 00:16:42,826
- A comprehensive workup... 
- ...did not reveal any...

302
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:45,038
- ...abnormalities.
- Your doppler was negative.

303
00:16:45,109 --> 00:16:47,658
...for venous thrombosis so there's no need for chronic...

304
00:16:47,704 --> 00:16:49,200
...anticoagulation or an oral...

305
00:16:49,272 --> 00:16:52,190
- The biopsy was, however, positive... 
- ...for a mixed anaerobic...

306
00:16:52,258 --> 00:16:54,013
...non-group-"a" streptococci infection.

307
00:16:54,085 --> 00:16:56,253
Your B.U.N. and creatinine elevations had us worried...

308
00:16:56,311 --> 00:16:58,191
...about rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis...

309
00:16:58,248 --> 00:17:00,192
...which could have signaled an autoimmune disease.

310
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:01,320
What does that mean?

311
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,779
We're not gonna amputate your leg.

312
00:17:03,511 --> 00:17:05,845
- You get to keep your kidneys.
- Congratulations.

313
00:17:06,132 --> 00:17:07,519
You can go home today.

314
00:17:07,617 --> 00:17:09,205
Yeah, yeah. Congratulations. Whatever.

315
00:17:13,976 --> 00:17:14,928
Congratulations.

316
00:17:15,087 --> 00:17:17,065
There's nothing wrong with you. You're gonna be fine.

317
00:17:17,141 --> 00:17:18,205
Congratulations.

318
00:17:22,368 --> 00:17:23,611
What's your favorite '80s group?

319
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:24,365
Queen.

320
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:25,540
No.

321
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,529
- Twisted Sister.
- Oh!

322
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:30,259
It's not like there's a right or wrong answer to that question.

323
00:17:30,355 --> 00:17:33,150
The Go-Gos, Duran Duran, The Eurythmics.

324
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,618
Have a nice day.

325
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:40,969
You can go home today.

326
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,166
Time of death -- 15:45.

327
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:12,303
Man, I've called every hospital in the county.

328
00:18:14,097 --> 00:18:17,538
I don't know. Sooner or later, the guy that did this is gonna seek medical attention.

329
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:20,752
When he does, that penis you're carrying around is gonna nail him.

330
00:18:21,204 --> 00:18:22,416
Where is her family?

331
00:18:22,498 --> 00:18:23,435
Doesn't have any.

332
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,729
No siblings?

333
00:18:25,525 --> 00:18:26,211
No.

334
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:27,449
Both parents are dead.

335
00:18:28,268 --> 00:18:29,908
She just moved to Seattle three weeks ago.

336
00:18:30,394 --> 00:18:31,560
Welcome to the city.

337
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:40,864
Meredith, are you okay?

338
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:43,706
Yeah, I'm fine.

339
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:46,108
I just have to do something.

340
00:18:46,845 --> 00:18:47,781
I have to go.

341
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:49,848
All right. I'm gonna sit with her.

342
00:18:49,988 --> 00:18:50,694
Dr. Burke?

343
00:18:50,816 --> 00:18:55,076
There's a baby up in peds. I saw him have a tet spell, and I think I hear a murmur.

344
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:57,093
Hmm. Did peds call us for a consult?

345
00:18:57,176 --> 00:18:59,614
- Actually, no, they're not -- 
- So you want me to what?

346
00:18:59,715 --> 00:19:02,306
- If you could just go up and look at him.
- Not without a peds consult.

347
00:19:02,393 --> 00:19:04,550
I'm a busy man, Grey, and there are rules.

348
00:19:04,672 --> 00:19:07,166
Look, it's not like I'm the chief or something.

349
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:19,469
You're hot.

350
00:19:20,207 --> 00:19:21,604
You're drunk. Hold still.

351
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,608
Wait, you're that --

352
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:28,880
that girl from the magazine.

353
00:19:29,027 --> 00:19:30,093
The red bikini.

354
00:19:30,826 --> 00:19:31,880
Yeah, it was pink.

355
00:19:31,977 --> 00:19:33,553
I'm done. You can see the nurse outside now.

356
00:19:36,698 --> 00:19:39,068
- Is she crazy or something?
- I don't think so.

357
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:44,547
Please. Please sit down. I really need to look at your arm.

358
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:46,855
Okay.

359
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:09,620
What are you doing down here?

360
00:20:09,978 --> 00:20:11,652
Just sitting here with my penis.

361
00:20:11,796 --> 00:20:12,666
What about you?

362
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,716
Hiding from Alex.

363
00:20:17,141 --> 00:20:18,298
I kissed Derek.

364
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,110
You kissed Derek?

365
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:21,488
In the elevator.

366
00:20:21,657 --> 00:20:23,106
Oh,  you kissed him in the elevator?

367
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:24,750
I was having a bad day.

368
00:20:25,973 --> 00:20:28,103
I am having a bad day.

369
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,933
This is what do you do on your bad days -- make out with Dr. Mcdreamy.

370
00:20:34,806 --> 00:20:38,334
Well... you know, that and carrying around a penis

371
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:40,901
just makes everything seem so shiny and happy.

372
00:20:41,052 --> 00:20:42,890
George said Allison was wearing your shoes.

373
00:20:43,238 --> 00:20:43,955
Yeah.

374
00:20:44,902 --> 00:20:46,167
It's weird, right?

375
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:48,748
It's weird that you care.

376
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:51,280
I think it's weird.

377
00:21:16,866 --> 00:21:18,054
Can I have security, please?

378
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,250
What do we got?

379
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:26,431
- Take a look.
- What?

380
00:21:30,193 --> 00:21:31,541
Uh, let's get him to O.R. 1.

381
00:21:31,596 --> 00:21:34,337
Meredith, you call the chief and let him know we got the rapist.

382
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:39,790
I saw Allison.

383
00:21:39,885 --> 00:21:41,954
You can't believe the beating that she took.

384
00:21:42,057 --> 00:21:43,280
And then to see this.

385
00:21:43,352 --> 00:21:45,313
That old saying, "you should see the other guy."

386
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,873
Why are we not attempting to re-attach the severed penis?

387
00:21:47,946 --> 00:21:49,476
Teeth don't slice. They tear.

388
00:21:49,552 --> 00:21:51,176
You can only re-attach with a clean cut.

389
00:21:51,248 --> 00:21:52,983
If she wanted to slice him off with a knife...

390
00:21:53,076 --> 00:21:56,445
Besides, the digestive juices didn't leave much of the flesh to work with.

391
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:57,750
Right. So, what do we do?

392
00:21:57,837 --> 00:21:59,900
Sew him up minus a large part of the family jewels.

393
00:21:59,966 --> 00:22:01,171
And his outlook?

394
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:04,139
He'll be urinating out of a bag for a very, very long time.

395
00:22:04,221 --> 00:22:05,768
Not to mention he'll never be able to have sex again.

396
00:22:05,854 --> 00:22:07,196
- Oh, too bad.
- Shame.

397
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,040
Let's all take a moment to grieve.

398
00:22:09,378 --> 00:22:10,155
Clamp.

399
00:22:15,163 --> 00:22:15,854
Richard.

400
00:22:16,741 --> 00:22:18,276
We got the rapist.

401
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,499
He stumbled right into the hospital.

402
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,885
Yeah, I heard.

403
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:26,391
- Listen, Burke -- 
- Why?

404
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:28,009
You really want to know?

405
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,672
I want to know when you stopped thinking of me as your number one.

406
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:38,654
- Richard, I do more in this hospital than -- 
- You do only exactly as much as is necessary.

407
00:22:38,955 --> 00:22:40,395
You never take an extra step.

408
00:22:40,482 --> 00:22:42,032
You never give an extra minute.

409
00:22:42,339 --> 00:22:45,924
You're comfortable and arrogant, and it doesn't impress me.

410
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:47,275
You want to be chief?

411
00:22:47,352 --> 00:22:48,249
Earn it.

412
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:22,856
I'm sorry. I have patients lined up.

413
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:25,007
I don't have time. I don't understand you.

414
00:23:25,108 --> 00:23:26,629
I'm sorry.

415
00:23:46,245 --> 00:23:47,534
My head hurts.

416
00:23:47,723 --> 00:23:48,788
Maybe it's a tumor.

417
00:23:48,901 --> 00:23:50,314
You wish I had a tumor.

418
00:23:50,438 --> 00:23:53,156
Look, I'd rip your face off if it meant I got to scrub in.

419
00:23:53,326 --> 00:23:55,213
I've been suturing all day.

420
00:23:55,613 --> 00:23:57,365
My hands are numb.

421
00:23:57,482 --> 00:23:58,813
At least you're helping people.

422
00:23:58,931 --> 00:24:01,061
At least you get to practice freakin' medicine.

423
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:04,230
I had to send my chinese lady away.

424
00:24:04,592 --> 00:24:06,657
She was, like, camped out down there.

425
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,914
Oh, poor Izzie, turning away patients. Boohoo.

426
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:14,341
So the police say they can't send a crime-scene guy down for hours,

427
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:16,441
so I have to spend the night with the penis.

428
00:24:18,341 --> 00:24:19,943
Alex, don't say it.

429
00:24:20,081 --> 00:24:21,489
It was too easy anyway.

430
00:24:24,224 --> 00:24:26,653
Who here feels like they have no idea what they're doing?

431
00:24:28,954 --> 00:24:30,925
I mean, are we supposed to be learning something?

432
00:24:30,988 --> 00:24:32,538
Because I don't feel like I'm learning anything.

433
00:24:32,621 --> 00:24:33,875
Except how not to sleep.

434
00:24:33,967 --> 00:24:37,761
It's like there's this wall. The attendings and the residents are over there,

435
00:24:37,838 --> 00:24:40,445
being surgeons, and we're over here, being...

436
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:44,105
Suturing, code-running, lab-delivering penis minders.

437
00:24:44,212 --> 00:24:45,722
I hate being an intern.

438
00:25:21,001 --> 00:25:22,301
- Hi.
- Hi.

439
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:25,542
Is he yours?

440
00:25:26,268 --> 00:25:26,934
Yeah.

441
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,097
He's adorable.

442
00:25:28,754 --> 00:25:29,331
Thanks.

443
00:25:37,062 --> 00:25:38,300
Oh, please.

444
00:25:40,178 --> 00:25:42,249
You are so out of line.

445
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,962
She says the murmur might not be benign.

446
00:25:45,428 --> 00:25:47,772
I think we should do an echo to check.

447
00:25:48,024 --> 00:25:49,257
This is your career.

448
00:25:50,307 --> 00:25:52,729
There really is no reason to get alarmed.

449
00:25:53,932 --> 00:25:54,843
What's the problem?

450
00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:59,174
If our baby is sick, we want him treated... now.

451
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:00,376
Who said your baby was sick?

452
00:26:00,461 --> 00:26:03,291
The surgical intern, who has no business on our service.

453
00:26:03,533 --> 00:26:05,043
Who authorized you being here?

454
00:26:05,663 --> 00:26:07,485
- I was just -- 
- I did.

455
00:26:08,078 --> 00:26:09,328
Can you excuse us for a second?

456
00:26:10,075 --> 00:26:10,921
Dr. Burke.

457
00:26:11,324 --> 00:26:13,505
Are you messing with my intern, Dr. Kay?

458
00:26:13,971 --> 00:26:14,882
No, sir.

459
00:26:15,314 --> 00:26:16,169
Give me the chart.

460
00:26:16,266 --> 00:26:17,377
There's nothing wrong with him. I checked.

461
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:18,452
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

462
00:26:19,901 --> 00:26:22,579
You can guarantee he's fine? You're 100% sure?

463
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,564
How sure are you?

464
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:27,766
I don't know, 75%?

465
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:29,870
Not good enough. He's my patient now.

466
00:26:29,983 --> 00:26:31,232
That okay with you, Dr. Kay?

467
00:26:31,453 --> 00:26:32,470
Absolutely.

468
00:26:32,794 --> 00:26:33,992
He can take our patient?

469
00:26:34,074 --> 00:26:35,128
He's an attending.

470
00:26:35,288 --> 00:26:37,216
Which means I can do whatever I want.

471
00:26:39,551 --> 00:26:42,112
Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, I'm Dr. Burke, head of cardio.

472
00:26:42,516 --> 00:26:45,798
We're gonna run some tests and give you an answer within the hour.

473
00:26:46,285 --> 00:26:48,107
Grey. Excuse me.

474
00:26:49,045 --> 00:26:52,629
I want an ekg, chest x-ray, and an echo.

475
00:26:52,823 --> 00:26:54,083
I don't have all day.

476
00:26:54,185 --> 00:26:56,033
- You're a busy man.
- I'm a busy man.

477
00:26:59,592 --> 00:27:00,565
Anybody else?

478
00:27:00,867 --> 00:27:03,134
- No. No more.
- I need a bed.

479
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:06,069
Ms. Lu?

480
00:27:22,304 --> 00:27:23,349
Ms. Lu!

481
00:27:23,565 --> 00:27:25,299
Ms. Lu, wait! Ms. Lu!

482
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:27,287
What is it?

483
00:27:39,903 --> 00:27:40,646
Hello?

484
00:27:51,566 --> 00:27:52,629
Oh, my god.

485
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:56,292
It's okay.

486
00:27:57,162 --> 00:27:57,903
It's okay.

487
00:27:58,708 --> 00:28:00,637
I'll help.

488
00:28:11,145 --> 00:28:12,019
It's deep.

489
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:14,231
It's deep -- I need to clean it out.

490
00:28:14,732 --> 00:28:17,206
Machine broke in the factory.

491
00:28:17,302 --> 00:28:18,185
Fall.

492
00:28:18,328 --> 00:28:19,428
You speak english.

493
00:28:20,336 --> 00:28:22,003
Just -- if you could come inside.

494
00:28:22,137 --> 00:28:24,861
No, no, no inside. No... jail.

495
00:28:25,711 --> 00:28:26,443
Jail?

496
00:28:26,587 --> 00:28:27,667
She came inside.

497
00:28:28,163 --> 00:28:29,489
She green card.

498
00:28:29,715 --> 00:28:30,974
Me, no.

499
00:28:31,881 --> 00:28:33,002
You're illegal.

500
00:28:33,566 --> 00:28:35,501
That's okay. We don't have to tell them that.

501
00:28:35,598 --> 00:28:38,127
I just need to get you inside. I have to sew that up.

502
00:28:38,204 --> 00:28:39,509
No inside.

503
00:28:39,652 --> 00:28:42,116
Please, I promise. I promise you won't go to jail.

504
00:28:42,203 --> 00:28:44,169
Just -- it's raining. Please come inside.

505
00:28:46,163 --> 00:28:48,591
Okay, okay, okay.

506
00:28:49,513 --> 00:28:50,533
Not inside.

507
00:28:54,521 --> 00:28:56,928
Uh... wait here, okay?

508
00:28:57,015 --> 00:28:59,145
Wait. I'll come back. I'll be back.

509
00:29:05,089 --> 00:29:07,220
- Well?
- It's a birth defect.

510
00:29:07,341 --> 00:29:09,447
Tetralogy of fallot with pulmonary atresia.

511
00:29:09,543 --> 00:29:11,971
You were right. I'm booking the O.R. For tomorrow.

512
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:14,070
Thank you for backing me up on this.

513
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,401
Wait. Whoa.

514
00:29:15,652 --> 00:29:16,635
You were right.

515
00:29:16,977 --> 00:29:18,969
But if you ever pull a stunt like that again --

516
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,068
going to the parents behind a doctor's back,

517
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,060
trying to steal a patient from another service --

518
00:29:23,164 --> 00:29:25,918
I will make your residency here hell on earth.

519
00:29:42,913 --> 00:29:45,260
Three, four, five. Breathe.

520
00:29:45,604 --> 00:29:46,916
Charging to 200, please.

521
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,608
Four, five. Breathe.

522
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:36,621
Damn it.

523
00:30:46,255 --> 00:30:48,422
Okay. You're all sewn up.

524
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,214
That's pretty good.

525
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:57,070
I could've done a better job if I'd had more light.

526
00:30:57,818 --> 00:30:59,133
You might have a scar.

527
00:30:59,507 --> 00:31:00,665
It is good.

528
00:31:05,008 --> 00:31:08,338
You're gonna need to come back in five days.

529
00:31:08,461 --> 00:31:13,071
Okay? I'm gonna need to check the wound and remove the stitches, okay?

530
00:31:15,548 --> 00:31:18,128
So, uh... here's my pager number on this card.

531
00:31:18,207 --> 00:31:19,844
Right here, okay?

532
00:31:20,042 --> 00:31:22,757
We'll meet right back here, okay?

533
00:31:22,865 --> 00:31:24,038
You have to come back.

534
00:31:24,723 --> 00:31:29,342
But you can't tell anybody that I helped you outside of the hospital, or I might lose my job.

535
00:31:29,561 --> 00:31:30,443
Understand?

536
00:31:30,678 --> 00:31:33,309
Yes. Come back and don't tell.

537
00:31:33,504 --> 00:31:34,293
Yes.

538
00:31:34,896 --> 00:31:37,472
Okay, that's it. I'm done. You can go.

539
00:31:37,923 --> 00:31:39,525
I'll see you in five days.

540
00:31:39,746 --> 00:31:40,616
See you.

541
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:04,619
Thank you.

542
00:32:36,201 --> 00:32:37,668
Do you think I'm too confident?

543
00:32:37,965 --> 00:32:38,681
No.

544
00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:41,247
Don't lie.

545
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,879
You are my boss.

546
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:51,063
All right, then. Anything you say in the next 30 seconds is free, starting now.

547
00:32:54,577 --> 00:32:58,206
I think you're cocky, arrogant, bossy, and pushy.

548
00:32:58,296 --> 00:32:59,895
You also have a god complex.

549
00:32:59,982 --> 00:33:02,009
You never think about anybody but your damn self.

550
00:33:02,082 --> 00:33:04,303
- But I -- 
- But what? I still have 22 more seconds.

551
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:05,466
I'm not done.

552
00:33:07,538 --> 00:33:10,360
I need a drink, a man, or a massage.

553
00:33:11,134 --> 00:33:13,622
Or a drunken massage by a man.

554
00:33:16,116 --> 00:33:17,124
What's wrong with you?

555
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:22,064
I lost five patients on the code team today.

556
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:24,096
I feel like the angel of death.

557
00:33:25,018 --> 00:33:28,368
George, 95% of all code patients can't be revived.

558
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,635
Most of them are seriously dead before you even get there.

559
00:33:32,608 --> 00:33:33,458
What?

560
00:33:35,915 --> 00:33:39,462
Why didn't you tell me that when I was going on and on about how great it was gonna be?

561
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:40,517
Because...

562
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,040
you're George and I'm Cristina.

563
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:54,382
His heart surgery is scheduled for the morning.

564
00:34:00,147 --> 00:34:02,390
I really did think I was right, you know?

565
00:34:03,025 --> 00:34:04,002
I know.

566
00:34:06,788 --> 00:34:08,590
We almost never are.

567
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,101
We're interns.

568
00:34:10,577 --> 00:34:12,118
We're not supposed to be right.

569
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:15,092
And when we are, it's completely shocking.

570
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:17,832
Are you --

571
00:34:19,082 --> 00:34:21,293
I mean, being an intern, do you feel --

572
00:34:21,457 --> 00:34:22,547
Terrified.

573
00:34:22,972 --> 00:34:25,067
100% of the time.

574
00:34:26,767 --> 00:34:28,297
Good. It's not just me.

575
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:30,677
No.

576
00:34:49,376 --> 00:34:50,303
How is she?

577
00:34:51,809 --> 00:34:52,694
No change.

578
00:34:53,473 --> 00:34:54,871
Have you been here all night?

579
00:34:58,391 --> 00:34:59,570
Yep.

580
00:35:00,087 --> 00:35:01,469
You know, I have four sisters.

581
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,488
Very girly. Tons of kids.

582
00:35:03,585 --> 00:35:05,259
If I was in a coma, they'd all be here.

583
00:35:05,631 --> 00:35:06,693
I'd want them here.

584
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:08,802
Not having no one?

585
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:10,963
Can't imagine that.

586
00:35:11,705 --> 00:35:12,540
I can.

587
00:35:13,246 --> 00:35:14,654
What are you talking about? What about your mother?

588
00:35:15,545 --> 00:35:17,567
She'd be here ordering all the surgeons around.

589
00:35:17,905 --> 00:35:22,170
She'd fly these cowboys in from prague to do these amazing medical procedures.

590
00:35:23,316 --> 00:35:24,569
That's true.

591
00:35:24,946 --> 00:35:26,148
I do have my mother.

592
00:35:30,632 --> 00:35:32,815
So we're kissing, but we're not dating?

593
00:35:34,608 --> 00:35:35,887
I knew that was gonna come up.

594
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:37,357
Don't get me wrong. I like the kissing.

595
00:35:38,257 --> 00:35:39,476
I'm all for the kissing.

596
00:35:40,142 --> 00:35:41,413
More kissing, I say.

597
00:35:42,062 --> 00:35:43,860
I have no idea what that was about.

598
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:46,383
Is it gonna happen again? 'Cause if it is, I need to bring breath mints.

599
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:48,119
Put a condom in my wallet.

600
00:35:48,216 --> 00:35:49,168
Shut up now.

601
00:35:50,919 --> 00:35:53,270
There's this baby up in the nursery.

602
00:35:54,877 --> 00:35:56,111
He's brand-new.

603
00:35:56,772 --> 00:35:59,634
No one's neglected him or damaged him yet.

604
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:03,428
How do we get from there to here?

605
00:36:05,178 --> 00:36:08,256
She's wearing my shoes, and someone's beat the crap out of her.

606
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,550
And she's got nobody.

607
00:36:17,211 --> 00:36:19,268
Her icp's doubled. Get O.R.!

608
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:20,969
Prep for craniotomy.

609
00:36:21,255 --> 00:36:24,066
Let's hang a mannitol, uh... take a blood gas.

610
00:36:34,743 --> 00:36:35,453
Hey.

611
00:36:40,138 --> 00:36:44,604
I, uh, had to leave her skull flap off until the pressure in her brain goes down.

612
00:36:46,379 --> 00:36:47,916
She's not gonna make it, is she?

613
00:36:48,725 --> 00:36:49,857
She's gonna be fine.

614
00:36:52,344 --> 00:36:53,769
If she ever wakes up.

615
00:36:55,909 --> 00:36:57,440
If she ever wakes up.

616
00:37:02,877 --> 00:37:03,732
Dr. Burke?

617
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,046
I'm off at 6:00. You want to get that drink we talked about?

618
00:37:06,149 --> 00:37:07,100
I don't think so.

619
00:37:07,363 --> 00:37:08,652
Well, what about tomorrow night?

620
00:37:10,901 --> 00:37:14,115
Shepherd, you should know that Richard promised chief to both of us.

621
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:20,562
But you knew that already.

622
00:37:22,205 --> 00:37:24,366
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.

623
00:37:25,927 --> 00:37:26,998
You're not the enemy.

624
00:37:27,642 --> 00:37:29,117
You're just the competition.

625
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:39,240
So, here is where you have the signature, and down here, the initials.

626
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:39,843
Okay.

627
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:43,653
It just says that the, um... the...

628
00:37:44,646 --> 00:37:45,465
penis.

629
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:47,641
Look, I'm a doctor.

630
00:37:47,764 --> 00:37:49,321
I mean, it shouldn't be weird to say this.

631
00:37:49,946 --> 00:37:52,211
It's just that I used to change her diapers.

632
00:37:52,618 --> 00:37:53,462
I get it.

633
00:37:53,611 --> 00:37:55,327
It just says that it was never out of your sight.

634
00:37:55,404 --> 00:37:56,860
Here we go. One penis.

635
00:37:59,759 --> 00:38:00,461
Officer.

636
00:38:05,137 --> 00:38:10,378
We'll be using a median approach for a transventricular repair with a right ventriculotomy.

637
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:11,628
Let's open him up.

638
00:38:11,926 --> 00:38:13,575
Open. The 10 blade, please.

639
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,200
Grey?

640
00:38:17,937 --> 00:38:18,741
Yes, sir?

641
00:38:19,304 --> 00:38:23,154
Go scrub in. When we're finished cracking the baby's chest, I'll let you hold the clamp.

642
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:25,431
Seriously?

643
00:38:26,665 --> 00:38:28,289
Don't make me change my mind.

644
00:38:28,638 --> 00:38:29,396
I'm going.

645
00:38:37,394 --> 00:38:38,632
I have good news and bad news.

646
00:38:38,867 --> 00:38:41,033
The good news is Dr. Bailey stopped the bleeding.

647
00:38:41,124 --> 00:38:43,316
The bad news is we've given your penis to the cops.

648
00:38:44,181 --> 00:38:45,507
Have a nice life.

649
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:51,355
The results of your labs are clean.

650
00:38:51,472 --> 00:38:53,788
The tumor is benign. You can go home today.

651
00:38:57,413 --> 00:38:58,671
Oh, you...

652
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:22,966
At some point, you have to make a decision.

653
00:39:25,275 --> 00:39:28,045
Boundaries don't keep other people out.

654
00:39:30,406 --> 00:39:31,623
They fence you in.

655
00:39:33,858 --> 00:39:35,178
Life is messy.

656
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,802
That's how we're made.

657
00:39:40,108 --> 00:39:43,779
Okay, fine, George and Izzie, you can move into the house.

658
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:47,649
- Yes!
- I can't believe you caved!

659
00:39:47,884 --> 00:39:48,699
Thank you.

660
00:39:49,688 --> 00:39:50,400
Yes!

661
00:39:52,116 --> 00:39:53,711
I can't believe I caved.

662
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,648
I blame the babies.

663
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:57,158
They make you toxic.

664
00:39:58,737 --> 00:40:02,083
So you can waste your life drawing lines...

665
00:40:10,365 --> 00:40:13,583
...or you can live your life crossing them.

666
00:40:19,469 --> 00:40:20,525
Welcome back.

667
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,190
...But there are some lines...

668
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:46,049
So, it's intense.

669
00:40:46,951 --> 00:40:50,611
This thing I have for ferryboats, I mean.

670
00:40:50,862 --> 00:40:53,945
...way too dangerous to cross.

671
00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:56,509
I'm so taking the stairs this time.

672
00:40:57,672 --> 00:40:59,116
No self-control.

673
00:40:59,545 --> 00:41:00,616
It's sad.

674
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:02,136
Really.

675
00:41:12,504 --> 00:41:13,957
Here's what I know.

676
00:41:16,754 --> 00:41:18,771
If you're willing to take the chance...

677
00:41:22,431 --> 00:41:24,100
the view from the other side...

678
00:41:26,415 --> 00:41:28,079
is spectacular.
