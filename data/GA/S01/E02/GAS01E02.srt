1
00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:02,916
Previously on "Grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:03,161 --> 00:00:07,581
The 7 years you spend here as a surgical resident
will be the best and worst of your life.

3
00:00:07,656 --> 00:00:09,198
You will be pushed to the breaking point.

4
00:00:09,265 --> 00:00:11,794
Eight of you will switch to an easier specialty.

5
00:00:11,866 --> 00:00:13,734
Five of you will crack under the pressure.

6
00:00:13,796 --> 00:00:15,220
Two of you will be asked to leave.

7
00:00:15,357 --> 00:00:17,391
Dr. Shepherd, we should pretend it never happened.

8
00:00:17,456 --> 00:00:19,623
What never happened - you
sleeping with me last night,

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:20,985
or you throwing me out this morning?

10
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:23,407
You're an attending, and I'm your intern.

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,398
Stop looking at me like that.

12
00:00:25,468 --> 00:00:26,152
Like what?

13
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:27,421
Like you've seen me naked.

14
00:00:27,514 --> 00:00:31,071
Your first shift starts now and lasts 48 hours.

15
00:00:31,158 --> 00:00:35,572
You're interns, grunts, nobodies,
bottom of the surgical food chain.

16
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:37,293
What are you doing here?

17
00:00:37,487 --> 00:00:39,740
You and I are gonna have so much fun together.

18
00:00:41,164 --> 00:00:42,515
You know Meredith is inbred?

19
00:00:42,673 --> 00:00:45,059
Like it's uncommon around here
to be a doctor's parents.

20
00:00:45,136 --> 00:00:47,143
No, royally inbred. Her mother is Ellis Grey.

21
00:00:47,209 --> 00:00:48,387
Shut up. The Ellis Grey?

22
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:49,585
She's a living legend.

23
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,012
What's your name?

24
00:00:52,294 --> 00:00:54,137
It's me, mom - Meredith.

25
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,269
All right.

26
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,305
We're gonna survive this, right?

27
00:01:15,106 --> 00:01:17,080
It's all about lines.

28
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,587
The finish line at the end of residency.

29
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:25,497
Waiting in line for a chance
at the operating table.

30
00:01:28,113 --> 00:01:31,027
And then there's the most important line -

31
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:35,220
the line separating you from
the people you work with.

32
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:41,768
It doesn't help to get too familiar.

33
00:01:45,555 --> 00:01:46,648
To make friends.

34
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,397
You need boundaries between you
and the rest of the world.

35
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,332
Other people are far too messy.

36
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,496
It's all about lines.

37
00:02:03,037 --> 00:02:04,537
Drawing lines in the sand

38
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:08,106
and praying like hell no one crosses them.

39
00:02:09,022 --> 00:02:10,632
Look, I'm sure you're very nice,

40
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:14,077
but I'm very particular about who lives
in my house, and you're just not right.

41
00:02:14,163 --> 00:02:18,347
Why? Look, I'm quiet. No loud music, no parties.

42
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,457
Where were you when the challenger exploded?

43
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:21,649
The what?

44
00:02:21,771 --> 00:02:23,657
The space shuttle challenger.

45
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,750
Uh... I think I was in kindergarten.

46
00:02:26,277 --> 00:02:28,213
Exactly. No.

47
00:02:29,377 --> 00:02:31,756
Why do you put up posters for roommates
if you don't want roommates?

48
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:34,183
I do want roommates. We're
together 100 hours a week.

49
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,581
You want to live together, too?

50
00:02:35,913 --> 00:02:37,536
I see you bring bribes now, huh?

51
00:02:37,898 --> 00:02:41,228
My mom irons my scrubs. I
have to get out of there.

52
00:02:41,336 --> 00:02:43,429
It's not a bribe. I don't think it's a good idea.

53
00:02:43,486 --> 00:02:46,011
- I can put down last, first, and deposit.
- It's totally a bribe.

54
00:02:46,297 --> 00:02:48,407
I can cook, and I'm an obsessive cleaner.

55
00:02:48,488 --> 00:02:51,714
No. I just want two total strangers
who I don't have to talk to

56
00:02:51,786 --> 00:02:55,446
or be nice to, and it's not a bribe.
It's a mocha latte.

57
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,995
George, you're running the code team.
Meredith, take the trauma pager.

58
00:02:59,077 --> 00:03:01,212
Christina, deliver the weekend
labs to the patients.

59
00:03:01,335 --> 00:03:02,865
Izzie, you're on sutures.

60
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:07,868
Dr. Bailey, I was hoping to
assist you in the O.R. Today.

61
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,898
Maybe, do a minor procedure, I think I'm ready.

62
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:12,020
Mocha latte?

63
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,601
- If she gets to cut, I want to cut, too.
- Yeah, me too.

64
00:03:14,703 --> 00:03:16,478
I wouldn't mind another shot. I
mean, if everybody else is...

65
00:03:16,555 --> 00:03:17,739
Stop talking.

66
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:21,170
Every intern wants to perform their first surgery.

67
00:03:21,252 --> 00:03:22,706
That's not your job.

68
00:03:22,823 --> 00:03:25,568
Do you know what your job is?
To make your resident happy.

69
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:29,453
Do I look happy? No. Why?
Because my interns are whiny.

70
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,406
You know what will make me look happy?

71
00:03:31,697 --> 00:03:34,825
Having a code team staffed,
having the trauma pages answered,

72
00:03:34,887 --> 00:03:39,489
having the weekend labs delivered, and having
someone down in the pit, doing the sutures.

73
00:03:41,114 --> 00:03:44,895
No one holds a scalpel till I'm so
happy, I'm Mary freakin' Poppins.

74
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:47,159
Mocha latte, my ass.

75
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:49,223
Why are y'all standing there? Move!

76
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,502
Seattle has ferryboats.

77
00:04:02,151 --> 00:04:02,902
Yes.

78
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:03,902
I didn't know that.

79
00:04:04,055 --> 00:04:05,228
I've been living here six weeks.

80
00:04:05,336 --> 00:04:06,558
I didn't know there were ferryboats.

81
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:09,604
Seattle is surrounded by water on three sides.

82
00:04:09,677 --> 00:04:10,767
Hence the ferryboats.

83
00:04:11,828 --> 00:04:13,189
Now I have to like it here.

84
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,171
I wasn't planning on liking it here.

85
00:04:15,918 --> 00:04:16,947
I'm from New York.

86
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:20,014
I'm genetically engineered to dislike
everywhere except Manhattan.

87
00:04:20,931 --> 00:04:22,328
I have a thing for ferryboats.

88
00:04:28,345 --> 00:04:29,738
I'm not going out with you.

89
00:04:29,906 --> 00:04:31,314
Did I ask you to go out with me?

90
00:04:33,438 --> 00:04:34,657
Do you want to go out with me?

91
00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:38,667
I'm not dating you, and I'm definitely
not sleeping with you again.

92
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:39,548
You're my boss.

93
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:40,859
I'm your boss's boss.

94
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:43,566
You're my teacher and my teacher's teacher.

95
00:04:43,648 --> 00:04:44,647
And you're my teacher.

96
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,096
"I'm your sister, I'm your daughter."

97
00:04:46,347 --> 00:04:48,789
- You're sexually harassing me.
- I'm riding an elevator.

98
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:52,250
Look, I'm drawing a line.

99
00:04:52,496 --> 00:04:53,751
The line is drawn.

100
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,116
There's a big line.

101
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:04,717
So, this line, is it imaginary or
do I need to get you a marker?

102
00:05:27,215 --> 00:05:28,274
We'll talk later?

103
00:05:34,123 --> 00:05:35,191
- Are you the surgeon?
- Yeah.

104
00:05:35,546 --> 00:05:37,429
- We've got a rape victim.
- Better get in there.

105
00:05:39,752 --> 00:05:43,482
25-year-old female found down at the park.
Status - post trauma.

106
00:05:43,554 --> 00:05:46,778
She came in with a gcs of six. B.P. - 80 over 60.

107
00:05:47,735 --> 00:05:50,179
Exam is significant for blunt head trauma.

108
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:54,474
Unequal breath sounds, right pupil is
dilated, and she's ready for x-ray.

109
00:05:54,802 --> 00:05:55,595
Ready to roll?

110
00:05:58,682 --> 00:05:59,343
Hey!

111
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:00,689
Yeah.

112
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,496
Call ahead to clear a C.T.
Let them know I'm coming.

113
00:06:06,731 --> 00:06:08,124
Load up the portable monitor.

114
00:06:08,442 --> 00:06:10,249
Call respiratory for a ventilator.

115
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:11,806
I'll get x-rays while I'm down there.

116
00:06:17,684 --> 00:06:20,699
She's gonna spend a hell of a
long time in recovery and rehab.

117
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,974
If she survives.

118
00:06:22,665 --> 00:06:24,637
What is she, like 5'2", 100 pounds?

119
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:26,766
She's still breathing after
what this guy did to her?

120
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:28,993
If they catch the guy, they should castrate him.

121
00:06:29,695 --> 00:06:31,252
See how shredded her hands are?

122
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,572
She tried to fight back.

123
00:06:32,706 --> 00:06:34,744
Tried to? Rape kit came back negative.

124
00:06:34,824 --> 00:06:35,977
She kicked his ass.

125
00:06:36,945 --> 00:06:39,336
So, we have a warrior among us, huh?

126
00:06:41,088 --> 00:06:42,019
Allison.

127
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:46,356
Her - her name is Allison.

128
00:06:48,348 --> 00:06:49,202
Allison.

129
00:06:50,473 --> 00:06:52,945
I think I may have found the cause of our rupture.

130
00:06:53,104 --> 00:06:53,877
More suction.

131
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:02,592
What is this?

132
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:04,906
Does anyone know what this is?

133
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:07,594
Oh, my god.

134
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:09,268
What? Spit it out, Grey.

135
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,680
- She bit it off.
- Bit off what?

136
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:15,099
That's his... penis.

137
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:19,344
She bit off his - his penis.

138
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,859
If she can fight the infection, she'll be fine.

139
00:07:57,975 --> 00:08:01,135
It's all gonna depend on whether or not
she wakes up in the next 72 hours.

140
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,403
Yo, we should get a drink later.

141
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:06,941
You can tell me the long story of what makes a
hotshot doc leave the big apple for Seattle.

142
00:08:07,104 --> 00:08:08,605
Short story, actually.

143
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,050
Your chief of surgery made me
an offer I couldn't refuse.

144
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,388
Richard asked you to come?

145
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,622
Yeah. Why?

146
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:17,951
Oh, nothing.

147
00:08:18,856 --> 00:08:19,674
See you later.

148
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:28,886
Do you know what the code team does?

149
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:31,214
Saves lives.

150
00:08:31,686 --> 00:08:34,681
I shock a heart, and someone
lives to see another day.

151
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:36,115
That's upbeat.

152
00:08:36,295 --> 00:08:38,403
It's a glass half full -

153
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:41,317
Bambi, don't say another word till
after the hunter shoots your mother.

154
00:08:43,718 --> 00:08:44,937
I don't like you.

155
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:48,234
I have a B.A. from Smith, a PHD from Berkeley,

156
00:08:48,315 --> 00:08:51,449
and an M.D. from Stanford, and
I'm delivering lab results.

157
00:08:51,553 --> 00:08:52,970
It's gonna take me all day to get through these.

158
00:08:53,304 --> 00:08:54,659
Then get started.

159
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:56,718
Oh, I wasn't complaining.

160
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,852
Intern was reassigned, so he's mine now.

161
00:08:59,923 --> 00:09:01,640
Have him shadow you for the day.

162
00:09:01,723 --> 00:09:03,277
You show him how I do things.

163
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:07,378
Alex Karev. Nice to meet you.

164
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:09,814
You're the pig who called Meredith a nurse. Yeah.

165
00:09:09,995 --> 00:09:11,351
I hate you on principle.

166
00:09:11,505 --> 00:09:15,411
And you're the pushy, overbearing kiss-ass.
I hate you, too.

167
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:16,701
Oh, it should be fun, then.

168
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:31,965
I'm Dr. O’Malley. I'll be running this code.
What do we got?

169
00:09:32,066 --> 00:09:34,581
We have a 57-year-old gentleman with asystole.

170
00:09:36,755 --> 00:09:38,533
- Three and four.
- Charging to 200, please.

171
00:09:38,853 --> 00:09:40,469
- Charging.
- Cleared.

172
00:09:40,752 --> 00:09:42,957
All right, Mrs. Lu, I'm Dr. Stevens.

173
00:09:43,151 --> 00:09:44,699
I'm gonna sew up your wound.

174
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,972
You're gonna need - yeah - about six stitches.

175
00:09:47,068 --> 00:09:48,508
Are you allergic to any medication?

176
00:09:51,963 --> 00:09:55,154
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't - Do you speak english?

177
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:05,224
I'll find, um -

178
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:07,441
Does anybody here speak chinese?

179
00:10:16,453 --> 00:10:17,917
- Hi.
- Is the chief in?

180
00:10:18,027 --> 00:10:19,110
He's on his way.

181
00:10:19,477 --> 00:10:20,293
Is that it?

182
00:10:20,697 --> 00:10:21,454
Yeah.

183
00:10:21,915 --> 00:10:22,924
Can I see it?

184
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,114
No. Forget I asked.

185
00:10:26,355 --> 00:10:28,065
Meredith, it's good to see you.

186
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:30,021
Hey, I heard your mother was leaving Mayo.

187
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:31,747
She going back with the U.N.?

188
00:10:32,273 --> 00:10:33,973
She's, uh, taking time off.

189
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,386
To write another book, I suppose.

190
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,307
Listen, so, they said to bring this to you, so -

191
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,255
Yes, uh, for the police.

192
00:10:41,571 --> 00:10:42,179
Right.

193
00:10:42,264 --> 00:10:43,364
When did the police say they were coming?

194
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:46,349
You know how slow they are, so
she better take it with her.

195
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:47,100
What?

196
00:10:47,685 --> 00:10:49,148
You have to take it with you.

197
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,524
Chain-of-custody rules.

198
00:10:51,658 --> 00:10:54,029
All medical matter in a rape
must stay with the person

199
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,752
who collected it until it's
placed into police custody.

200
00:10:56,835 --> 00:11:00,239
You collected the specimen, so you have custody.

201
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,863
Custody of a penis.

202
00:11:01,945 --> 00:11:04,171
Yes, until the cops come for it.

203
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:04,966
Okay.

204
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:07,264
Well, what am I supposed to do with the penis?

205
00:11:10,658 --> 00:11:14,637
You have a disorder called
multinucleate cell angiohistiocytoma.

206
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,475
It's not a cancer sarcoma.

207
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:19,440
It's very rare but minor.

208
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,734
You'll be discharged today, okay?

209
00:11:21,851 --> 00:11:23,033
I don't need a surgery?

210
00:11:23,127 --> 00:11:23,710
No.

211
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:25,826
I'm not gonna die? I'm fine?

212
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,925
Fit as a fiddle... or whatever.

213
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:43,003
What's that?

214
00:11:43,238 --> 00:11:44,795
Don't ask. You don't want to know.

215
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,023
I do want to know.

216
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:47,180
Really.

217
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:48,307
You really want to know?

218
00:11:49,547 --> 00:11:50,883
It's a severed penis.

219
00:11:51,995 --> 00:11:52,806
Okay.

220
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,948
I didn't really want to know.

221
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,658
Why do I have to be the one who gets hugged?

222
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,188
Because - I don't do that.

223
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,980
Besides, you're the ovarian sister here.

224
00:12:00,056 --> 00:12:02,494
Did you call me an ovarian s- an ovarian s-

225
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:05,617
Since when does the possession
of ovaries become an insult?

226
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,972
Meredith's carrying a penis around in a jar.

227
00:12:08,357 --> 00:12:09,637
Oh, from the rape surgery?

228
00:12:09,775 --> 00:12:11,690
Yeah, and it's not a jar.

229
00:12:11,808 --> 00:12:12,721
It's a cooler.

230
00:12:15,171 --> 00:12:17,506
Talk about taking a bite out of crime.

231
00:12:24,597 --> 00:12:25,356
You okay?

232
00:12:26,164 --> 00:12:26,795
Yeah.

233
00:12:27,723 --> 00:12:29,953
- Allison's shoes are...
- What?

234
00:12:32,478 --> 00:12:34,648
The rape victim, Allison, her shoes.

235
00:12:34,802 --> 00:12:37,199
I have the same ones in my locker,

236
00:12:37,295 --> 00:12:39,851
and I normally never wear them
because they're not comfortable.

237
00:12:39,937 --> 00:12:41,155
But today I did.

238
00:12:41,592 --> 00:12:45,304
And she was wearing the same
shoes, and it's just...

239
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:49,225
stupid, and I'm tired, and forget it.

240
00:12:51,206 --> 00:12:52,380
You know what you need?

241
00:12:56,829 --> 00:12:57,658
No.

242
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:01,277
It's sick and twisted.

243
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,418
We said last time was the last time.

244
00:13:05,748 --> 00:13:07,448
You've been doing it without me?

245
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,029
Nancy Reagan lied.

246
00:13:09,746 --> 00:13:11,645
You can't just say no. Come on.

247
00:13:11,856 --> 00:13:13,925
Do you know what would happen if anyone knew?

248
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:15,046
I'm doing it.

249
00:13:16,413 --> 00:13:17,948
You can come with me,

250
00:13:18,123 --> 00:13:20,995
or you can stay here and be miserable.

251
00:13:32,923 --> 00:13:34,619
You are such a woman.

252
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:39,914
That's a code.

253
00:13:42,234 --> 00:13:43,150
I got to go.

254
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:56,734
You are really cute.

255
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:34,717
What are you doing in here?

256
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:38,517
The - there were no tests ordered,
and the baby has a murmur.

257
00:14:38,614 --> 00:14:39,391
I know.

258
00:14:40,594 --> 00:14:42,038
He turned blue.

259
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,507
You're surgery. You're not
authorized to be in here.

260
00:14:44,598 --> 00:14:46,452
Do you know how much trouble
you can get into for this?

261
00:14:46,538 --> 00:14:48,029
Are you going to do any tests?

262
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:50,579
It's a benign systolic ejection murmur.

263
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:52,587
- It goes away with age.
- So you're not gonna do tests.

264
00:14:52,663 --> 00:14:54,879
He's not your patient. He's
not even on your service.

265
00:14:54,972 --> 00:14:56,513
Are you sure it's benign?

266
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,402
I'm a doctor, too, you know.

267
00:14:58,699 --> 00:14:59,835
You should get out of here.

268
00:15:10,184 --> 00:15:12,057
- You get a good case?
- No - her.

269
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:14,131
She won't let me sew her up.

270
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,279
I wouldn't have called you, but I
can't get ahold of the translator.

271
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,989
Can you just ask her what's wrong?

272
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:27,597
No.

273
00:15:28,201 --> 00:15:29,051
Why not?

274
00:15:31,512 --> 00:15:33,076
Because I grew up in Beverly Hills.

275
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,559
The only chinese I know is from a Mr. Chow's menu.

276
00:15:35,646 --> 00:15:37,023
Besides, I'm Korean.

277
00:15:47,857 --> 00:15:48,701
Chief.

278
00:15:49,598 --> 00:15:51,733
So, you asked Shepherd to come to Grace, huh?

279
00:15:51,974 --> 00:15:53,334
He was an old student of mine.

280
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:56,713
He left a Manhattan private
practice because you asked.

281
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:57,952
Yes.

282
00:15:58,404 --> 00:15:59,270
No other reason?

283
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,574
Just a favor for an old professor?

284
00:16:01,697 --> 00:16:04,881
- It'll be years before I retire.
- Chief of surgery is mine.

285
00:16:05,557 --> 00:16:06,965
Chief of surgery is mine.

286
00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:08,783
It was yours. Now I'm not so sure.

287
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:12,034
I am the best surgeon at Grace
with the lowest mortality rate.

288
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:15,797
- You can't just bring -
- Now ask me why I'm not so sure about you.

289
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:19,391
Ask me why.

290
00:16:29,358 --> 00:16:31,077
Don't people get sick anymore?

291
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:36,088
I mean, how are we supposed to get any O.R.
time if everyone's gonna just live?

292
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:39,456
Look.

293
00:16:40,411 --> 00:16:42,483
I'll take 10, you take 10.

294
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:43,471
Get in, get out.

295
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,647
No smiling, no hugging, no letting them cry.

296
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:46,820
Just be quick about it.

297
00:16:47,557 --> 00:16:48,911
You're the one that's slow.

298
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:50,609
I am not slow. You are slow.

299
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,561
You want to bet?

300
00:16:51,822 --> 00:16:52,657
Yeah, you're on.

301
00:16:54,475 --> 00:16:56,476
- A comprehensive workup...
- ...did not reveal any...

302
00:16:56,521 --> 00:16:58,688
- ...abnormalities.
- Your Doppler was negative.

303
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:01,308
...for venous thrombosis so
there's no need for chronic...

304
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,850
...anticoagulation or an oral...

305
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:05,840
- The biopsy was, however, positive...
- ...for a mixed anaerobic...

306
00:17:05,908 --> 00:17:07,663
...non-group-"a" streptococci infection.

307
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,903
Your B.U.N. and creatinine
elevations had us worried...

308
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:11,841
...about rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis...

309
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,842
...which could have signaled
an autoimmune disease.

310
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:14,970
What does that mean?

311
00:17:15,045 --> 00:17:16,429
We're not gonna amputate your leg.

312
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,495
- You get to keep your kidneys.
- Congratulations.

313
00:17:19,782 --> 00:17:21,169
You can go home today.

314
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:22,855
Yeah, yeah. Congratulations. Whatever.

315
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:28,578
Congratulations.

316
00:17:28,737 --> 00:17:30,715
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're gonna be fine.

317
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:31,855
Congratulations.

318
00:17:36,018 --> 00:17:37,261
What's your favorite '80s group?

319
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,015
Queen.

320
00:17:38,487 --> 00:17:39,190
No.

321
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:41,179
- Twisted Sister.
- Oh!

322
00:17:41,651 --> 00:17:43,909
It's not like there's a right or
wrong answer to that question.

323
00:17:44,005 --> 00:17:46,800
The Go-Gos, Duran Duran, The Eurythmics.

324
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,268
Have a nice day.

325
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:54,619
You can go home today.

326
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,816
Time of death - 15:45.

327
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,953
Man, I've called every hospital in the county.

328
00:18:27,747 --> 00:18:31,188
I don't know. Sooner or later, the guy that
did this is gonna seek medical attention.

329
00:18:31,258 --> 00:18:34,402
When he does, that penis you're
carrying around is gonna nail him.

330
00:18:34,854 --> 00:18:36,066
Where is her family?

331
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,085
Doesn't have any.

332
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,379
No siblings?

333
00:18:39,175 --> 00:18:39,861
No.

334
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:41,099
Both parents are dead.

335
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:43,558
She just moved to Seattle three weeks ago.

336
00:18:44,044 --> 00:18:45,210
Welcome to the city.

337
00:18:53,459 --> 00:18:54,514
Meredith, are you okay?

338
00:18:55,507 --> 00:18:57,356
Yeah, I'm fine.

339
00:18:57,459 --> 00:18:59,758
I just have to do something.

340
00:19:00,495 --> 00:19:01,431
I have to go.

341
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:03,498
All right. I'm gonna sit with her.

342
00:19:03,638 --> 00:19:04,344
Dr. Burke?

343
00:19:04,466 --> 00:19:08,726
There's a baby up in peds. I saw him have
a test spell, and I think I hear a murmur.

344
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:10,743
Hmm. Did peds call us for a consult?

345
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:13,264
- Actually, no, they're not -
- So you want me to what?

346
00:19:13,365 --> 00:19:15,956
- If you could just go up and look at him.
- Not without a peds consult.

347
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:18,200
I'm a busy man, Grey, and there are rules.

348
00:19:18,322 --> 00:19:20,816
Look, it's not like I'm the chief or something.

349
00:19:32,153 --> 00:19:33,119
You're hot.

350
00:19:33,857 --> 00:19:35,254
You're drunk. Hold still.

351
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,258
Wait, you're that -

352
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:42,530
that girl from the magazine.

353
00:19:42,677 --> 00:19:43,743
The red bikini.

354
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:45,530
Yeah, it was pink.

355
00:19:45,627 --> 00:19:47,203
I'm done. You can see the nurse outside now.

356
00:19:50,348 --> 00:19:52,718
- Is she crazy or something?
- I don't think so.

357
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:58,197
Please. Please sit down. I
really need to look at your arm.

358
00:19:59,794 --> 00:20:00,505
Okay.

359
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,270
What are you doing down here?

360
00:20:23,628 --> 00:20:25,302
Just sitting here with my penis.

361
00:20:25,446 --> 00:20:26,316
What about you?

362
00:20:26,449 --> 00:20:27,366
Hiding from Alex.

363
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:31,948
I kissed Derek.

364
00:20:32,951 --> 00:20:33,760
You kissed Derek?

365
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:35,138
In the elevator.

366
00:20:35,307 --> 00:20:36,756
Oh, you kissed him in the elevator?

367
00:20:36,873 --> 00:20:38,400
I was having a bad day.

368
00:20:39,623 --> 00:20:41,753
I am having a bad day.

369
00:20:42,705 --> 00:20:45,583
This is what do you do on your bad
days - make out with Dr. Mcdreamy.

370
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:51,984
Well... you know, that and carrying around a penis

371
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:54,551
just makes everything seem so shiny and happy.

372
00:20:54,702 --> 00:20:56,540
George said Allison was wearing your shoes.

373
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:57,605
Yeah.

374
00:20:58,552 --> 00:20:59,817
It's weird, right?

375
00:21:01,046 --> 00:21:02,398
It's weird that you care.

376
00:21:03,688 --> 00:21:04,930
I think it's weird.

377
00:21:30,516 --> 00:21:31,704
Can I have security, please?

378
00:21:37,223 --> 00:21:37,900
What do we got?

379
00:21:38,846 --> 00:21:40,081
- Take a look.
- What?

380
00:21:43,843 --> 00:21:45,191
Uh, let's get him to O.R. 1.

381
00:21:45,246 --> 00:21:47,987
Meredith, you call the chief and
let him know we got the rapist.

382
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:05,640
I saw Allison.

383
00:22:05,735 --> 00:22:07,804
You can't believe the beating that she took.

384
00:22:07,907 --> 00:22:09,130
And then to see this.

385
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,163
That old saying, "you should see the other guy."

386
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,723
Why are we not attempting to
re-attach the severed penis?

387
00:22:13,796 --> 00:22:15,326
Teeth don't slice. They tear.

388
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:17,026
You can only re-attach with a clean cut.

389
00:22:17,098 --> 00:22:18,833
If she wanted to slice him off with a knife...

390
00:22:18,926 --> 00:22:22,295
Besides, the digestive juices didn't
leave much of the flesh to work with.

391
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:23,600
Right. So, what do we do?

392
00:22:23,687 --> 00:22:25,750
Sew him up minus a large
part of the family jewels.

393
00:22:25,816 --> 00:22:27,021
And his outlook?

394
00:22:27,204 --> 00:22:29,989
He'll be urinating out of a bag
for a very, very long time.

395
00:22:30,071 --> 00:22:31,618
Not to mention he'll never
be able to have sex again.

396
00:22:31,704 --> 00:22:33,046
- Oh, too bad.
- Shame.

397
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,890
Let's all take a moment to grieve.

398
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,005
Clamp.

399
00:22:41,013 --> 00:22:41,704
Richard.

400
00:22:42,591 --> 00:22:44,126
We got the rapist.

401
00:22:44,475 --> 00:22:46,349
He stumbled right into the hospital.

402
00:22:46,778 --> 00:22:47,735
Yeah, I heard.

403
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:52,241
- Listen, Burke -
- Why?

404
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:53,859
You really want to know?

405
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:56,522
I want to know when you stopped
thinking of me as your number one.

406
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:04,504
- Richard, I do more in this hospital than -
- You do only exactly as much as is necessary.

407
00:23:04,805 --> 00:23:06,245
You never take an extra step.

408
00:23:06,332 --> 00:23:07,882
You never give an extra minute.

409
00:23:08,189 --> 00:23:11,774
You're comfortable and arrogant,
and it doesn't impress me.

410
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:13,125
You want to be chief?

411
00:23:13,202 --> 00:23:14,099
Earn it.

412
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:48,706
I'm sorry. I have patients lined up.

413
00:23:48,783 --> 00:23:50,857
I don't have time. I don't understand you.

414
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,479
I'm sorry.

415
00:24:12,095 --> 00:24:13,384
My head hurts.

416
00:24:13,573 --> 00:24:14,638
Maybe it's a tumor.

417
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:16,164
You wish I had a tumor.

418
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,006
Look, I'd rip your face off if
it meant I got to scrub in.

419
00:24:19,176 --> 00:24:21,063
I've been suturing all day.

420
00:24:21,463 --> 00:24:23,215
My hands are numb.

421
00:24:23,332 --> 00:24:24,663
At least you're helping people.

422
00:24:24,781 --> 00:24:26,911
At least you get to practice freakin' medicine.

423
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:30,080
I had to send my chinese lady away.

424
00:24:30,442 --> 00:24:32,507
She was, like, camped out down there.

425
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,764
Oh, poor Izzie, turning away patients. Boohoo.

426
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:40,191
So the police say they can't send
a crime-scene guy down for hours,

427
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,291
so I have to spend the night with the penis.

428
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,793
Alex, don't say it.

429
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:47,339
It was too easy anyway.

430
00:24:50,074 --> 00:24:52,503
Who here feels like they have
no idea what they're doing?

431
00:24:54,804 --> 00:24:56,775
I mean, are we supposed to be learning something?

432
00:24:56,838 --> 00:24:58,388
Because I don't feel like I'm learning anything.

433
00:24:58,471 --> 00:24:59,725
Except how not to sleep.

434
00:24:59,817 --> 00:25:03,611
It's like there's this wall. The attendings
and the residents are over there,

435
00:25:03,688 --> 00:25:06,295
being surgeons, and we're over here, being...

436
00:25:06,597 --> 00:25:09,955
Suturing, code-running,
lab-delivering penis minders.

437
00:25:10,062 --> 00:25:11,572
I hate being an intern.

438
00:25:46,851 --> 00:25:48,151
- Hi.
- Hi.

439
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:51,392
Is he yours?

440
00:25:52,118 --> 00:25:52,784
Yeah.

441
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,947
He's adorable.

442
00:25:54,604 --> 00:25:55,181
Thanks.

443
00:26:02,912 --> 00:26:04,150
Oh, please.

444
00:26:06,028 --> 00:26:08,099
You are so out of line.

445
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,812
She says the murmur might not be benign.

446
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,622
I think we should do an echo to check.

447
00:26:13,874 --> 00:26:15,107
This is your career.

448
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:18,579
There really is no reason to get alarmed.

449
00:26:19,782 --> 00:26:20,693
What's the problem?

450
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:25,024
If our baby is sick, we want him treated... now.

451
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:26,226
Who said your baby was sick?

452
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:29,141
The surgical intern, who has
no business on our service.

453
00:26:29,383 --> 00:26:30,893
Who authorized you being here?

454
00:26:31,513 --> 00:26:33,335
- I was just -
- I did.

455
00:26:33,928 --> 00:26:35,178
Can you excuse us for a second?

456
00:26:35,925 --> 00:26:36,771
Dr. Burke.

457
00:26:37,174 --> 00:26:39,355
Are you messing with my intern, Dr. Kay?

458
00:26:39,821 --> 00:26:40,732
No, sir.

459
00:26:41,164 --> 00:26:42,019
Give me the chart.

460
00:26:42,116 --> 00:26:43,227
There's nothing wrong with him. I checked.

461
00:26:43,344 --> 00:26:44,302
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

462
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:48,429
You can guarantee he's fine? You're 100% sure?

463
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,414
How sure are you?

464
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:53,616
I don't know, 75%?

465
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:55,720
Not good enough. He's my patient now.

466
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:57,082
That okay with you, Dr. Kay?

467
00:26:57,303 --> 00:26:58,320
Absolutely.

468
00:26:58,644 --> 00:26:59,842
He can take our patient?

469
00:26:59,924 --> 00:27:00,978
He's an attending.

470
00:27:01,138 --> 00:27:03,066
Which means I can do whatever I want.

471
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:07,962
Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, I'm
Dr. Burke, head of cardio.

472
00:27:08,366 --> 00:27:11,648
We're gonna run some tests and give
you an answer within the hour.

473
00:27:12,135 --> 00:27:13,957
Grey. Excuse me.

474
00:27:14,895 --> 00:27:18,479
I want an ekg, chest x-ray, and an echo.

475
00:27:18,673 --> 00:27:19,933
I don't have all day.

476
00:27:20,035 --> 00:27:21,883
- You're a busy man.
- I'm a busy man.

477
00:27:25,442 --> 00:27:26,415
Anybody else?

478
00:27:26,717 --> 00:27:28,984
- No. No more.
- I need a bed.

479
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:31,919
Ms. Lu?

480
00:27:48,154 --> 00:27:49,199
Ms. Lu!

481
00:27:49,415 --> 00:27:51,149
Ms. Lu, wait! Ms. Lu!

482
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:53,137
What is it?

483
00:28:05,753 --> 00:28:06,496
Hello?

484
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:18,479
Oh, my god.

485
00:28:21,316 --> 00:28:22,142
It's okay.

486
00:28:23,012 --> 00:28:23,753
It's okay.

487
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:26,487
I'll help.

488
00:28:43,095 --> 00:28:43,969
It's deep.

489
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,181
It's deep - I need to clean it out.

490
00:28:46,682 --> 00:28:49,156
Machine broke in the factory.

491
00:28:49,252 --> 00:28:50,135
Fall.

492
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:51,378
You speak english.

493
00:28:52,286 --> 00:28:53,953
Just - if you could come inside.

494
00:28:54,087 --> 00:28:56,811
No, no, no inside. No... jail.

495
00:28:57,661 --> 00:28:58,393
Jail?

496
00:28:58,537 --> 00:28:59,617
She came inside.

497
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,439
She green card.

498
00:29:01,665 --> 00:29:02,924
Me, no.

499
00:29:03,831 --> 00:29:04,952
You're illegal.

500
00:29:05,516 --> 00:29:07,451
That's okay. We don't have to tell them that.

501
00:29:07,548 --> 00:29:10,077
I just need to get you inside.
I have to sew that up.

502
00:29:10,154 --> 00:29:11,459
No inside.

503
00:29:11,602 --> 00:29:14,066
Please, I promise. I promise you won't go to jail.

504
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:16,119
Just - it's raining. Please come inside.

505
00:29:18,113 --> 00:29:20,541
Okay, okay, okay.

506
00:29:21,463 --> 00:29:22,483
Not inside.

507
00:29:26,471 --> 00:29:28,878
Uh... wait here, okay?

508
00:29:28,965 --> 00:29:31,095
Wait. I'll come back. I'll be back.

509
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,170
- Well?
- It's a birth defect.

510
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:41,397
Tetralogy of fallout with pulmonary atresia.

511
00:29:41,493 --> 00:29:43,921
You were right. I'm booking the O.R. For tomorrow.

512
00:29:44,244 --> 00:29:46,020
Thank you for backing me up on this.

513
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,351
Wait. Whoa.

514
00:29:47,602 --> 00:29:48,585
You were right.

515
00:29:48,927 --> 00:29:50,919
But if you ever pull a stunt like that again -

516
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:53,018
going to the parents behind a doctor's back,

517
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:55,010
trying to steal a patient from another service -

518
00:29:55,114 --> 00:29:57,868
I will make your residency here hell on earth.

519
00:30:14,863 --> 00:30:17,210
Three, four, five. Breathe.

520
00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:18,866
Charging to 200, please.

521
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,558
Four, five. Breathe.

522
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:08,571
Damn it.

523
00:31:18,205 --> 00:31:20,372
Okay. You're all sewn up.

524
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:25,164
That's pretty good.

525
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:29,020
I could've done a better
job if I'd had more light.

526
00:31:29,768 --> 00:31:31,083
You might have a scar.

527
00:31:31,457 --> 00:31:32,615
It is good.

528
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:40,288
You're gonna need to come back in five days.

529
00:31:40,411 --> 00:31:45,021
Okay? I'm gonna need to check the
wound and remove the stitches, okay?

530
00:31:47,498 --> 00:31:50,078
So, uh... here's my pager number on this card.

531
00:31:50,157 --> 00:31:51,794
Right here, okay?

532
00:31:51,992 --> 00:31:54,707
We'll meet right back here, okay?

533
00:31:54,815 --> 00:31:55,988
You have to come back.

534
00:31:56,673 --> 00:32:01,292
But you can't tell anybody that I helped you
outside of the hospital, or I might lose my job.

535
00:32:01,511 --> 00:32:02,393
Understand?

536
00:32:02,628 --> 00:32:05,259
Yes. Come back and don't tell.

537
00:32:05,454 --> 00:32:06,243
Yes.

538
00:32:06,846 --> 00:32:09,422
Okay, that's it. I'm done. You can go.

539
00:32:09,873 --> 00:32:11,475
I'll see you in five days.

540
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:12,566
See you.

541
00:32:35,158 --> 00:32:36,569
Thank you.

542
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:09,618
Do you think I'm too confident?

543
00:33:09,915 --> 00:33:10,631
No.

544
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:13,197
Don't lie.

545
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:15,829
You are my boss.

546
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:23,013
All right, then. Anything you say in the
next 30 seconds is free, starting now.

547
00:33:26,527 --> 00:33:30,156
I think you're cocky, arrogant, bossy, and pushy.

548
00:33:30,246 --> 00:33:31,845
You also have a god complex.

549
00:33:31,932 --> 00:33:33,959
You never think about anybody but your damn self.

550
00:33:34,032 --> 00:33:36,253
- But I -
- But what? I still have 22 more seconds.

551
00:33:36,325 --> 00:33:37,416
I'm not done.

552
00:33:39,488 --> 00:33:42,310
I need a drink, a man, or a massage.

553
00:33:43,084 --> 00:33:45,572
Or a drunken massage by a man.

554
00:33:48,066 --> 00:33:49,074
What's wrong with you?

555
00:33:51,658 --> 00:33:54,014
I lost five patients on the code team today.

556
00:33:54,496 --> 00:33:56,046
I feel like the angel of death.

557
00:33:56,968 --> 00:34:00,318
George, 95% of all code patients can't be revived.

558
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,585
Most of them are seriously dead
before you even get there.

559
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:05,408
What?

560
00:34:07,865 --> 00:34:11,412
Why didn't you tell me that when I was going
on and on about how great it was gonna be?

561
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:12,467
Because...

562
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,990
you're George and I'm Cristina.

563
00:34:24,214 --> 00:34:26,332
His heart surgery is scheduled for the morning.

564
00:34:32,097 --> 00:34:34,340
I really did think I was right, you know?

565
00:34:34,975 --> 00:34:35,952
I know.

566
00:34:38,738 --> 00:34:40,540
We almost never are.

567
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:42,051
We're interns.

568
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:44,068
We're not supposed to be right.

569
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:47,042
And when we are, it's completely shocking.

570
00:34:48,825 --> 00:34:49,782
Are you -

571
00:34:51,032 --> 00:34:53,243
I mean, being an intern, do you feel -

572
00:34:53,407 --> 00:34:54,497
Terrified.

573
00:34:54,922 --> 00:34:57,017
100% of the time.

574
00:34:58,717 --> 00:35:00,247
Good. It's not just me.

575
00:35:01,885 --> 00:35:02,627
No.

576
00:35:21,326 --> 00:35:22,253
How is she?

577
00:35:23,759 --> 00:35:24,644
No change.

578
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:26,821
Have you been here all night?

579
00:35:30,341 --> 00:35:31,520
Yep.

580
00:35:32,037 --> 00:35:33,419
You know, I have four sisters.

581
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:35,438
Very girly. Tons of kids.

582
00:35:35,535 --> 00:35:37,209
If I was in a coma, they'd all be here.

583
00:35:37,581 --> 00:35:38,643
I'd want them here.

584
00:35:39,575 --> 00:35:40,752
Not having no one?

585
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:42,913
Can't imagine that.

586
00:35:43,655 --> 00:35:44,490
I can.

587
00:35:45,196 --> 00:35:46,604
What are you talking about?
What about your mother?

588
00:35:47,495 --> 00:35:49,517
She'd be here ordering all the surgeons around.

589
00:35:49,855 --> 00:35:54,120
She'd fly these cowboys in from Prague
to do these amazing medical procedures.

590
00:35:55,266 --> 00:35:56,519
That's true.

591
00:35:56,896 --> 00:35:58,098
I do have my mother.

592
00:36:02,582 --> 00:36:04,765
So we're kissing, but we're not dating?

593
00:36:06,558 --> 00:36:07,837
I knew that was gonna come up.

594
00:36:07,908 --> 00:36:09,307
Don't get me wrong. I like the kissing.

595
00:36:10,207 --> 00:36:11,426
I'm all for the kissing.

596
00:36:12,092 --> 00:36:13,363
More kissing, I say.

597
00:36:14,012 --> 00:36:15,810
I have no idea what that was about.

598
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:18,333
Is it gonna happen again? 'Cause if
it is, I need to bring breath mints.

599
00:36:18,763 --> 00:36:20,069
Put a condom in my wallet.

600
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:21,118
Shut up now.

601
00:36:22,869 --> 00:36:25,220
There's this baby up in the nursery.

602
00:36:26,827 --> 00:36:28,061
He's brand-new.

603
00:36:28,722 --> 00:36:31,584
No one's neglected him or damaged him yet.

604
00:36:33,489 --> 00:36:35,378
How do we get from there to here?

605
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:40,206
She's wearing my shoes, and
someone's beat the crap out of her.

606
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,500
And she's got nobody.

607
00:36:49,161 --> 00:36:51,218
Her icp's doubled. Get O.R.!

608
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:52,919
Prep for craniotomy.

609
00:36:53,205 --> 00:36:56,016
Let's hang a mannitol, uh... take a blood gas.

610
00:37:11,693 --> 00:37:12,403
Hey.

611
00:37:17,088 --> 00:37:21,554
I, uh, had to leave her skull flap off
until the pressure in her brain goes down.

612
00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:24,866
She's not gonna make it, is she?

613
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:26,807
She's gonna be fine.

614
00:37:29,294 --> 00:37:30,719
If she ever wakes up.

615
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:34,390
If she ever wakes up.

616
00:37:39,827 --> 00:37:40,682
Dr. Burke?

617
00:37:41,005 --> 00:37:42,996
I'm off at 6:00. You want to get
that drink we talked about?

618
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:44,050
I don't think so.

619
00:37:44,313 --> 00:37:45,602
Well, what about tomorrow night?

620
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:51,065
Shepherd, you should know that Richard
promised chief to both of us.

621
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:57,512
But you knew that already.

622
00:37:59,155 --> 00:38:01,316
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.

623
00:38:02,877 --> 00:38:03,948
You're not the enemy.

624
00:38:04,592 --> 00:38:06,067
You're just the competition.

625
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:16,190
So, here is where you have the
signature, and down here, the initials.

626
00:38:16,273 --> 00:38:16,793
Okay.

627
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:20,603
It just says that the, um... the...

628
00:38:21,596 --> 00:38:22,415
penis.

629
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,591
Look, I'm a doctor.

630
00:38:24,714 --> 00:38:26,271
I mean, it shouldn't be weird to say this.

631
00:38:26,896 --> 00:38:29,161
It's just that I used to change her diapers.

632
00:38:29,568 --> 00:38:30,412
I get it.

633
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:32,277
It just says that it was never out of your sight.

634
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:33,810
Here we go. One penis.

635
00:38:36,709 --> 00:38:37,411
Officer.

636
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:44,696
We'll be using a
median approach for a

637
00:38:44,709 --> 00:38:47,328
transventricular repair with
a right ventriculotomy.

638
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,578
Let's open him up.

639
00:38:48,876 --> 00:38:50,525
Open. The 10 blade, please.

640
00:38:53,494 --> 00:38:54,150
Grey?

641
00:38:54,887 --> 00:38:55,691
Yes, sir?

642
00:38:56,254 --> 00:39:00,104
Go scrub in. When we're finished cracking the
baby's chest, I'll let you hold the clamp.

643
00:39:01,051 --> 00:39:02,381
Seriously?

644
00:39:03,615 --> 00:39:05,239
Don't make me change my mind.

645
00:39:05,588 --> 00:39:06,346
I'm going.

646
00:39:14,344 --> 00:39:15,582
I have good news and bad news.

647
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:17,983
The good news is Dr. Bailey stopped the bleeding.

648
00:39:18,074 --> 00:39:20,266
The bad news is we've given
your penis to the cops.

649
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:22,457
Have a nice life.

650
00:39:26,362 --> 00:39:28,305
The results of your labs are clean.

651
00:39:28,422 --> 00:39:30,738
The tumor is benign. You can go home today.

652
00:39:34,363 --> 00:39:35,621
Oh, you...

653
00:39:57,059 --> 00:39:59,916
At some point, you have to make a decision.

654
00:40:02,225 --> 00:40:04,995
Boundaries don't keep other people out.

655
00:40:07,356 --> 00:40:08,573
They fence you in.

656
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,128
Life is messy.

657
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:15,752
That's how we're made.

658
00:40:17,058 --> 00:40:20,729
Okay, fine, George and Izzie,
you can move into the house.

659
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:24,599
- Yes!
- I can't believe you caved!

660
00:40:24,834 --> 00:40:25,649
Thank you.

661
00:40:26,638 --> 00:40:27,350
Yes!

662
00:40:29,066 --> 00:40:30,661
I can't believe I caved.

663
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,598
I blame the babies.

664
00:40:32,991 --> 00:40:34,108
They make you toxic.

665
00:40:35,687 --> 00:40:39,033
So you can waste your life drawing lines...

666
00:40:47,315 --> 00:40:50,533
...or you can live your life crossing them.

667
00:40:56,419 --> 00:40:57,475
Welcome back.

668
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,140
...But there are some lines...

669
00:41:19,057 --> 00:41:22,999
So, it's intense.

670
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:27,561
This thing I have for ferryboats, I mean.

671
00:41:27,812 --> 00:41:30,895
...way too dangerous to cross.

672
00:41:31,017 --> 00:41:33,459
I'm so taking the stairs this time.

673
00:41:34,622 --> 00:41:36,066
No self-control.

674
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:37,566
It's sad.

675
00:41:38,225 --> 00:41:39,086
Really.

676
00:41:49,454 --> 00:41:50,907
Here's what I know.

677
00:41:53,704 --> 00:41:55,721
If you're willing to take the chance...

678
00:41:59,381 --> 00:42:01,050
the view from the other side...

679
00:42:03,365 --> 00:42:05,029
is spectacular.
