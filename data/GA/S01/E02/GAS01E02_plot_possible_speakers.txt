The episode opens with a recap of the pressures and expectations placed on surgical interns at Seattle Grace Hospital, narrated by Dr. Richard Webber. He warns that residency will be both the best and worst time of their lives, with many unable to handle the pressure.

Dr. Meredith Grey and Dr. Derek Shepherd awkwardly discuss their one-night stand, with Meredith insisting they pretend it never happened because he is her attending and she is his intern. Meredith is uncomfortable with Derek’s flirtatious attitude and tries to set boundaries.

Dr. Miranda Bailey introduces the new interns—Meredith, Cristina Yang, Izzie Stevens, George O’Malley, and Alex Karev—to their first 48-hour shift. She makes it clear that they are at the bottom of the hospital hierarchy and assigns them their duties: George runs the code team, Meredith takes the trauma pager, Cristina delivers labs, and Izzie is on sutures.

The interns gossip about Meredith’s background, revealing her mother is the famous surgeon Ellis Grey. Meredith is looking for roommates, but is picky about who she’ll let live in her house. Cristina and Izzie both want to move in, and George is desperate to leave his parents’ house. Meredith is hesitant but eventually relents.

The interns begin their hospital duties, eager for surgical opportunities. They try to curry favor with Dr. Bailey, but she reminds them their job is to keep her happy by doing the grunt work, not performing surgeries.

Meredith and Derek have another conversation, where Derek tries to charm her with talk about Seattle’s ferry boats. Meredith insists she won’t date or sleep with him again because he’s her boss. The conversation is interrupted by Dr. Webber, who asserts his authority as the chief.

A trauma case arrives: a 25-year-old rape victim named Allison. The interns, led by Alex and Cristina, handle the case. They discover that Allison fought back fiercely and bit off her attacker’s penis, which Meredith identifies in a specimen jar. The rape kit is negative, confirming Allison successfully defended herself. The interns are shaken by the brutality of the case.

Elsewhere, Izzie struggles to communicate with a Chinese-speaking patient, Mrs. Liu, and seeks help from Cristina, who reveals she is Korean and doesn’t speak Chinese. The language barrier complicates Mrs. Liu’s care.

The episode explores the competitive dynamics among the attendings. Dr. Preston Burke confronts Chief Webber about bringing Derek Shepherd to Seattle Grace, feeling threatened about his own prospects for chief of surgery. Webber criticizes Burke for doing only what’s necessary and challenges him to earn the position.

The interns continue their rounds, dealing with mundane tasks and feeling disconnected from the real surgical action. Izzie and Alex compete to see who can finish their patient rounds faster. George is frustrated by the lack of meaningful learning and the emotional toll of running the code team, where most patients cannot be revived.

Meredith is tasked with maintaining the chain of custody for the severed penis, which she must keep until the police arrive. She is uncomfortable but follows protocol.

Izzie and George bond over their difficult day, with Izzie confessing to kissing another doctor, Eric, in the elevator. They joke about the absurdity of their lives as interns.

Meredith notices a baby in the pediatric ward with a heart murmur and tries to get Dr. Burke to check on him. Burke refuses without a consult from Peds, citing hospital rules. Meredith later goes behind the pediatrician’s back to alert the baby’s parents, leading to a confrontation between services. Burke ultimately takes over the case, orders tests, and confirms a congenital heart defect, scheduling surgery for the next day. He warns Meredith never to undermine another doctor again.

Meanwhile, the police are searching for Allison’s attacker, knowing he will eventually seek medical attention for his injury. The hospital staff is instructed to be vigilant.

Izzie, George, and Meredith help Mrs. Liu, who is afraid to come inside the hospital because she is undocumented. They promise not to report her and treat her wound outside, with Meredith giving her a card to return for follow-up care.

The rapist is eventually brought into the hospital, severely injured. The surgical team discusses the impossibility of reattaching his penis due to the nature of the injury. Dr. Bailey delivers the news that he will be incontinent and impotent for life.

The episode also touches on the loneliness of patients like Allison, who has no family in Seattle. The interns reflect on their own support systems and the importance of having people who care.

At the end of the episode, Meredith decides to let George and Izzie move in with her, breaking her own rule about keeping boundaries. The interns celebrate, and Cristina jokes that babies make Meredith soft.

Meredith reflects on the importance and limitations of boundaries, concluding that while lines can protect you, they can also keep you isolated. She acknowledges that sometimes, crossing lines is necessary for growth and connection.

The episode closes with Meredith and Derek sharing a moment, hinting at the ongoing tension and attraction between them, and Meredith contemplating the risks and rewards of crossing personal and professional boundaries.
