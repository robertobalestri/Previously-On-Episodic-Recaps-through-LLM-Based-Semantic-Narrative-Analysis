The episode opens with a recap narrated by Meredith Grey, highlighting the pressures and challenges faced by surgical interns at Seattle Grace Hospital. Dr. Richard Webber, the Chief of Surgery, addresses the new interns, warning them about the grueling nature of their residency and the high attrition rate. Meredith and Dr. Derek Shepherd awkwardly discuss their one-night stand, with Meredith insisting they pretend it never happened because he is her attending and she is his intern.

Dr. Miranda Bailey, the residents’ supervisor, introduces herself to the interns—Meredith, Cristina Yang, Izzie Stevens, George O’Malley, and Alex Karev—and assigns them their first 48-hour shift. She makes it clear that as interns, they are at the bottom of the hospital hierarchy and must earn the right to perform surgeries by first handling basic tasks.

The interns discuss Meredith’s background, revealing her mother is the famous surgeon Ellis Grey. Meredith visits her mother, who is suffering from Alzheimer’s, in a care facility. The interns bond over their struggles and anxieties, with Meredith reflecting on the importance of boundaries and not getting too close to colleagues.

Meredith interviews potential roommates, including Izzie and George, but is initially reluctant to let them move in. Izzie tries to convince Meredith by promising to be quiet and responsible, while George mentions his mother still irons his scrubs. Eventually, Meredith relents, and both Izzie and George move in.

At the hospital, Dr. Bailey assigns the interns their duties: George runs the code team, Meredith takes the trauma pager, Cristina delivers labs, and Izzie is on sutures. The interns vie for opportunities to assist in surgeries, but Bailey reminds them that no one will hold a scalpel until she is satisfied with their performance.

Meredith and Derek continue to navigate their complicated relationship, exchanging flirtatious banter while Meredith insists on maintaining professional boundaries. The interns joke about drawing lines between personal and professional lives.

A rape victim named Allison is brought into the ER with severe injuries. Derek and Meredith take charge of her case, coordinating her care and preparing her for scans. The interns discuss the brutality of the attack and are shocked to discover that Allison bit off her attacker’s penis during the assault. Meredith is tasked with maintaining the chain of custody for the severed organ until the police arrive.

Elsewhere, Izzie struggles to communicate with a non-English-speaking patient, Mrs. Liu, who is afraid of being reported due to her immigration status. Izzie and Meredith promise to help her without jeopardizing her safety, ultimately treating her wound outside the hospital to avoid legal complications.

Cristina and Alex compete to deliver lab results and see patients quickly, each trying to prove their competence. Meanwhile, George is overwhelmed by his responsibilities on the code team, losing several patients and feeling like the “angel of death.” Cristina reassures him that most code patients cannot be revived, and it is not his fault.

Meredith becomes concerned about a baby in the nursery who has a heart murmur. She brings it to Dr. Burke’s attention, who initially refuses to intervene without a consult from pediatrics. Eventually, Burke agrees to run tests, confirming a congenital heart defect that requires surgery. Meredith is warned not to overstep her boundaries again.

The rapist, severely injured, is brought into the hospital. The surgical team, including Bailey, Shepherd, Burke, and the interns, discuss the impossibility of reattaching his penis due to the nature of the injury. They operate to save his life, but he will suffer permanent consequences.

Throughout the episode, the interns support each other through their exhaustion and emotional turmoil. They reflect on the challenges of being new doctors, the fear of making mistakes, and the difficulty of maintaining boundaries. Meredith, Cristina, and Izzie discuss the loneliness of patients like Allison, who has no family in Seattle, and compare it to their own experiences.

As the episode concludes, Meredith decides to let Izzie and George move in with her, acknowledging that boundaries can sometimes keep people out who should be let in. She and Derek share a moment, hinting at the ongoing tension between them. Meredith reflects on the importance of taking risks and crossing lines, suggesting that while some boundaries are necessary, others are meant to be challenged.

The episode ends with Meredith’s voiceover, emphasizing that life is messy, boundaries can be limiting, and sometimes the best experiences come from taking chances and crossing lines.
