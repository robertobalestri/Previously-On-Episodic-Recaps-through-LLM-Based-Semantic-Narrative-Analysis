The episode begins with Dr. Meredith Grey reflecting on the challenges of surgical residency, as Dr. Richard Webber warns new interns that their seven years will be both the best and worst of their lives, with many not making it through. Meredith and Dr. Derek Shepherd awkwardly discuss their previous night together, with Meredith insisting they pretend it never happened due to their professional relationship—he is her attending, and she is his intern.

Dr. Miranda Bailey introduces the interns to their first 48-hour shift, making it clear they are at the bottom of the surgical hierarchy. The interns—Meredith, Cristina Yang, George O'Malley, and Izzie Stevens—navigate the hospital, bantering about Meredith’s famous mother, Ellis Grey, and the pressures of being a doctor’s child. Meredith visits her mother, Ellis, who is suffering from Alzheimer’s, and struggles with the emotional distance between them.

Meredith is searching for roommates and interviews several applicants, including George and Izzie, who offer bribes and promises of cleanliness and quiet. Meredith is hesitant, wanting strangers she doesn’t have to interact with, but eventually considers George and Izzie as potential roommates.

Dr. Bailey assigns tasks: George runs the code team, Meredith takes the trauma pager, Cristina delivers labs, and Izzie is on sutures. The interns vie for opportunities to assist in surgery, but Bailey reminds them their job is to keep her happy, not to hold scalpels.

Meredith and Derek have a conversation about Seattle’s ferry boats, revealing Meredith’s reluctance to settle in the city. Derek flirts, but Meredith insists she won’t date or sleep with him again, emphasizing the need for professional boundaries.

A trauma case arrives: a 25-year-old rape victim named Allison is brought in with severe injuries. Meredith and other doctors coordinate her care, noting her resilience and the extent of her injuries. During the examination, they discover Allison bit off her attacker’s penis, which shocks the team. The specimen must be kept in Meredith’s custody until police arrive.

Dr. Addison Montgomery, a new attending, discusses her move from New York to Seattle, revealing she was recruited by Chief Webber. Tensions arise between Dr. Preston Burke and Webber over surgical assignments and the arrival of Shepherd.

George and Izzie discuss the code team’s responsibilities, and Cristina teases George about his optimism. The interns interact with a lab technician delivering results, and Cristina claims Alex Karev as her shadow for the day. Alex is abrasive, and Meredith expresses her dislike for him.

George leads a code in the ER, demonstrating his inexperience and anxiety. Izzie treats Mrs. Liu, a patient who doesn’t speak English, and struggles to communicate. Meredith is tasked with maintaining custody of the severed penis from the rape case, and the interns joke about the bizarre responsibility.

Dr. Bailey diagnoses a patient with a rare but minor disorder, reassuring them they don’t need surgery and will be discharged. The interns discuss the severed penis, with Cristina explaining its origin and the chain of custody rules.

Meredith is affected by Allison’s case, noticing they wore the same shoes that day, which makes her reflect on the randomness of trauma. She confides in her colleagues about feeling tired and overwhelmed.

Izzie discovers a baby with a heart murmur and confronts the attending physician, who dismisses her concerns. Izzie persists, seeking help from Dr. Burke, who initially refuses to intervene without a consult. Eventually, Burke agrees to run tests after Meredith advocates for the baby’s care, but warns Meredith against going behind other doctors’ backs.

Mrs. Liu, fearing deportation, resists treatment for her wound. Izzie reassures her, promising not to report her status, and treats her outside the hospital, risking her own job. Mrs. Liu is grateful, and Izzie gives her instructions for follow-up care.

The team operates on Allison, but her prognosis remains uncertain. The rapist is brought into the hospital, and the staff discuss the impossibility of reattaching his penis due to the nature of the injury. Bailey explains the consequences for the attacker, and the interns reflect on the brutality of the case.

Burke and Webber argue about surgical assignments and leadership, with Bailey challenging Burke to earn the position of chief by going beyond the minimum requirements. Alex apologizes to Izzie for his earlier behavior.

The interns gather, exhausted and doubting their abilities. George laments losing five patients on the code team, feeling like the angel of death, and Cristina comforts him by explaining the realities of code patients. Meredith, Izzie, and George discuss the divide between interns and attendings, feeling isolated from the real practice of medicine.

Meredith finally decides to let George and Izzie move in as her roommates, admitting she needs connection despite her desire for boundaries. The group celebrates, and Meredith reflects on the importance of crossing lines rather than drawing them.

The episode ends with Meredith and Derek sharing a moment, acknowledging the complexity of their relationship and the risks of crossing professional boundaries. Meredith concludes that while boundaries can protect, they can also isolate, and sometimes taking risks leads to spectacular outcomes.
