[meredith_grey] enters the locker room.
[meredith_grey] puts a notice for a roommate on the bulletin board.
[george_omalley] parks his car and heads to the hospital.
[george_omalley] realizes he forgot his badge and has to go back.
While retrieving the badge, [george_omalley] accidentally honks his horn.
[isobel_stevens] calls for an elevator.
When the doors open, [isobel_stevens] sees it is full of men who are staring at [isobel_stevens].
This makes [isobel_stevens] uncomfortable.
[cristina_yang] arrives at the hospital on her motorcycle.
[cristina_yang] almost runs over [george_omalley] as [cristina_yang] parks and then runs inside.
The interns are putting on their scrubs.
[meredith_grey] places her leopard print shoes in her locker.
[meredith_grey] talks to an intern who wants to be [meredith_grey]'s roommate.
However, [meredith_grey] feels the intern is not a good fit and declines.
[isobel_stevens] asks [meredith_grey] why [meredith_grey] puts up roommate posters if [meredith_grey] doesn't want a roommate.
[meredith_grey] agrees to something.
[cristina_yang] interrupts and points out that [meredith_grey] has a coffee meant for [miranda_bailey], calling it a bribe.
[george_omalley] mentions that [george_omalley]'s mom irons [george_omalley]'s scrubs and hints [george_omalley] wants to be [meredith_grey]'s roommate, but [meredith_grey] disagrees.
[isobel_stevens] also tries to ask to be [meredith_grey]'s roommate, but [meredith_grey] refuses.
[meredith_grey] states that [meredith_grey] wants two strangers who [meredith_grey] doesn't have to interact with.
[miranda_bailey] arrives and gives the interns their tasks.
As [miranda_bailey] goes upstairs, [meredith_grey] asks to help [miranda_bailey] in the operating room and offers [miranda_bailey] a mocha latte.
The interns quickly surround [miranda_bailey], arguing that if [meredith_grey] gets to assist, they should too.
[miranda_bailey] responds that their job is to make their resident happy, which [miranda_bailey] is not.
[miranda_bailey] takes the mocha latte and leaves, saying they won't get to use a scalpel until [miranda_bailey] is as happy as Mary Poppins.
[meredith_grey] then goes to the elevator, where [derek_shepherd] is also waiting.
[derek_shepherd] realizes that Seattle has ferry boats, which [derek_shepherd] didn't know after living there for six weeks.
When the doors open, [derek_shepherd] introduces himself as being from New York.
After the doors close, [meredith_grey] tells [derek_shepherd] that [meredith_grey] won't go out with [derek_shepherd].
[derek_shepherd] replies that [derek_shepherd] never asked but inquires if [meredith_grey] wants to.
[meredith_grey] declines and states that [meredith_grey] won't sleep with [derek_shepherd] because [derek_shepherd] is [meredith_grey]'s boss.
[derek_shepherd] brushes [meredith_grey] off, and [meredith_grey] accuses [derek_shepherd] of sexual harassment.
[meredith_grey] asserts that [meredith_grey] is setting a boundary, and [derek_shepherd] jokingly asks if [meredith_grey] needs a marker.
[meredith_grey] glares at [derek_shepherd], drops [meredith_grey]'s folders, and they kiss until the doors open.
Afterward, [meredith_grey] picks up [meredith_grey]'s folders and leaves.
[meredith_grey] then enters a trauma room where a nurse informs [meredith_grey] about a rape victim found in the park with serious injuries.
[meredith_grey] begins to lose focus when [meredith_grey] notices that the victim's shoes are identical to [meredith_grey]'s. A nurse calls [meredith_grey]'s name, bringing [meredith_grey] back to reality. [meredith_grey] then starts giving orders. The rape victim is currently in surgery. [derek_shepherd] mentions that [allison] will need a long recovery and rehabilitation. [derek_shepherd] is surprised that [allison] survived after what happened to her. [preston_burke] observes that [allison] fought back. [derek_shepherd] responds that [allison] did well since the rape kit showed no evidence of assault. [preston_burke] refers to [allison] as a warrior, but [meredith_grey] corrects [preston_burke], saying her name is [allison]. [preston_burke] discovers the cause of the injury but is unsure what it is. [preston_burke] asks the others in the room, and [meredith_grey] states it is the rapist's penis, causing the doctors to mumble in disgust. As [derek_shepherd] and [preston_burke] finish scrubbing up, [derek_shepherd] and [preston_burke] talk about [allison]'s recovery. [preston_burke] suggests they go for a drink later. [preston_burke] wants to know why [derek_shepherd] moved from New York to Seattle. [derek_shepherd] replies that there is nothing to explain; [richard_webber] made [derek_shepherd] an offer [derek_shepherd] couldn't refuse, and then [derek_shepherd] leaves. [george_omalley] boasts to [cristina_yang] about being on the code team, but [cristina_yang] tells [george_omalley] to stop talking. [cristina_yang] has a B.A. from Smith, a PhD from Berkeley, and an M.D.
[cristina_yang] has a B.A. from Smith, a PhD from Berkeley, and an M.D. from Stanford.
[cristina_yang] is working on labs and says it will take [cristina_yang] all day to finish them.
[miranda_bailey] hears this and tells [cristina_yang] to start working.
[cristina_yang] tries to explain that [cristina_yang] wasn't complaining, but [miranda_bailey] interrupts [cristina_yang].
[miranda_bailey] mentions that [miranda_bailey] has an intern who has been reassigned and that [cristina_yang] should show the intern how [cristina_yang] works.
The intern introduces himself as [alex_karev].
[cristina_yang] remembers that [alex_karev] called [meredith_grey] a nurse, so [cristina_yang] tells [alex_karev] that [cristina_yang] dislikes him.
[alex_karev] replies that [alex_karev] feels the same way as [alex_karev] and [cristina_yang] walk away.
[george_omalley]'s pager goes off, and [george_omalley] leaves too.
[george_omalley] runs down a corridor with the code team following him.
The patient is in critical condition and has no heartbeat.
[george_omalley] starts giving orders and tells a nurse to charge the paddles.
[isobel_stevens] tells [ms_lu], a Chinese woman, that [ms_lu] needs six stitches.
[isobel_stevens] asks [ms_lu] if [ms_lu] is allergic to any medication.
[ms_lu] responds in Cantonese, asking if [isobel_stevens] speaks Cantonese and requesting help.
[isobel_stevens] then asks [ms_lu] if [ms_lu] knows any English.
[ms_lu] replies in Cantonese, saying [ms_lu]'s daughter is outside with worse injuries, while [ms_lu] has only hurt [ms_lu]'s arm.
[isobel_stevens] asks if anyone in the room speaks Chinese, but no one responds.
Meanwhile, [meredith_grey] arrives at [richard_webber]'s office. [patricia_clarkson] is there and realizes the box contains the rapist's penis. [patricia_clarkson] asks to see it but quickly changes her mind. [richard_webber] enters and mentions he heard [meredith_grey]'s mother, [ellis_grey], is leaving Mayo Clinic. [meredith_grey] explains [ellis_grey] is just taking a break. [meredith_grey] tells [richard_webber] she was instructed to bring the "penis box" to him. [richard_webber] corrects [meredith_grey], stating the police need it. [richard_webber] explains that until the police take custody, [meredith_grey] must keep it because all medical items must stay with the person who collected them. [cristina_yang] and [alex_karev] give lab results to a family. [cristina_yang] and [alex_karev] inform the patient about a disorder called multinucleate cell angiohistiocytoma. [cristina_yang] and [alex_karev] explain it is not a cancerous sarcoma and is a very rare but minor disease. The family feels relieved and one member hugs [cristina_yang]. [cristina_yang] glares at [alex_karev], who is smiling at her. [meredith_grey] places a box on a counter where [george_omalley] is working. [george_omalley] asks [meredith_grey] what it is. [meredith_grey] tells [george_omalley] he does not want to know, but [george_omalley] insists he does. [meredith_grey] then reveals it is a penis box, and [george_omalley] regrets asking. [cristina_yang] and [alex_karev] walk by.
[cristina_yang] complains about being hugged all the time.
[alex_karev] responds that it is because [cristina_yang] is an ovarian sister.
[cristina_yang] feels insulted.
[george_omalley] points out that [meredith_grey] is carrying a penis in a jar.
[cristina_yang] looks at it, makes a joke, and leaves.
[george_omalley] asks [meredith_grey] if she is okay.
[meredith_grey] explains that [allison] has the same uncomfortable shoes she is wearing.
[meredith_grey] mentions that she rarely wears those shoes, but chose to wear them that day.
[meredith_grey] thinks the situation is foolish.
[george_omalley] believes he understands [meredith_grey]'s needs, but [meredith_grey] disagrees.
[george_omalley] offers [meredith_grey] a choice: join him or stay unhappy.
[george_omalley] and [meredith_grey] are outside the nursery, observing the babies.
[george_omalley]'s pager goes off, and [george_omalley] informs [meredith_grey] that it's an emergency, so [george_omalley] leaves.
While watching the babies, [meredith_grey] notices one baby's face turning blue.
[meredith_grey] enters the nursery to check on the baby.
A pediatric intern arrives and asks [meredith_grey] what she is doing.
[meredith_grey] explains that the baby has a murmur.
The intern acknowledges this but surprises [meredith_grey] by saying the baby turned blue.
The pediatric intern then tells [meredith_grey] that [meredith_grey] is not authorized to be there.
[meredith_grey] inquires about tests, but the pediatric intern reassures [meredith_grey] that it is benign and will resolve with age.
[meredith_grey] is told to leave, and [meredith_grey] does.
[isobel_stevens] brings [cristina_yang], thinking [isobel_stevens] can translate for [ms_lu].
[ms_lu] keeps saying [ms_lu]'s daughter is outside with a head injury, and [ms_lu] wants to help, but [ms_lu] can't.
[cristina_yang] explains [cristina_yang] is from Beverly Hills and only knows some Chinese from a menu.
[cristina_yang] also mentions [cristina_yang] is Korean and then leaves.
[preston_burke] asks [richard_webber] why [richard_webber] invited [derek_shepherd] to Seattle Grace.
[richard_webber] explains that [derek_shepherd] was [richard_webber]'s former student.
[preston_burke] realizes there might be another reason and mentions that [preston_burke] wants to be Chief of Surgery.
[richard_webber] responds that [richard_webber] won't be leaving anytime soon, and [preston_burke] storms off.
Meanwhile, [cristina_yang] is talking to [alex_karev].
[cristina_yang] asks [alex_karev] how they will get OR time.
[cristina_yang] gathers [cristina_yang]'s files and gives some to [alex_karev], telling [alex_karev] to hurry.
[cristina_yang] and [alex_karev] leave together.
[cristina_yang] and [alex_karev] provide lab results to several patients.
[cristina_yang] feels annoyed after one patient hugs [cristina_yang].
[george_omalley] rushes into a patient room with the code team.
The patient flatlines, and [george_omalley] has to call the time of death.
[meredith_grey] asks some interns about their favorite 80s music group.
When the interns answer incorrectly, [meredith_grey] walks away.
While [meredith_grey] is looking at [allison], [derek_shepherd] approaches [meredith_grey].
[derek_shepherd] tells [meredith_grey] that the rapist will eventually need medical care and that [meredith_grey] has evidence against him.
[meredith_grey] inquires about her family, and [derek_shepherd] informs [meredith_grey] that [meredith_grey]'s parents are dead and that [meredith_grey] has no siblings.
[derek_shepherd] then asks [meredith_grey] if [meredith_grey] is okay, and [meredith_grey] replies that [meredith_grey] is fine.
[meredith_grey] also asks [preston_burke] about a baby [meredith_grey] saw turning blue in pediatrics.
[preston_burke] states that [preston_burke] cannot proceed without a pediatric consult.
[isobel_stevens] is busy bandaging a man's hand.
The man tries to flirt with [isobel_stevens], but [isobel_stevens] realizes the man is drunk.
The man mentions that he thinks he recognizes [isobel_stevens] from a magazine.
[isobel_stevens] acknowledges this and tells the man to leave.
[ms_lu] arrives and sits down.
[isobel_stevens] starts stitching [ms_lu]'s arm while [ms_lu] continues speaking in Chinese.
[isobel_stevens] remains silent.
Meanwhile, [meredith_grey] is talking to [cristina_yang] in the lobby.
After a while, [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] notice a truck entering the parking lot.
[meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] go outside and see a man whose clothes are soaked in blood, especially around his crotch. The man collapses, and doctors and nurses rush to help him. [meredith_grey] realizes the man is the rapist. Inside, [meredith_grey] calls for security and shows [miranda_bailey] the rapist. [miranda_bailey] tells [meredith_grey] to take the rapist to OR 1 and to inform [richard_webber] about the situation. While the rapist is in surgery, [cristina_yang] and [meredith_grey] discuss [allison] and the rapist. [miranda_bailey] asks why they don't reattach the penis. [meredith_grey] explains they can't reattach it because it wasn't a clean cut, and [allison]'s digestive juices damaged it. [meredith_grey] mentions the rapist will have to use a bag to urinate for a long time. [cristina_yang] adds that the rapist will never be able to have sex again, which [cristina_yang] thinks is unfortunate. [miranda_bailey] sarcastically suggests they should take a moment to mourn, and then [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] return to their work. [richard_webber] leaves an operating room and tells [preston_burke] they have the rapist. The conversation shifts when [preston_burke] asks why he can't be Chief. [richard_webber] replies that he only does what is necessary and nothing more. Then, [richard_webber] walks away. [derek_shepherd] is worried about [allison]'s recovery. [isobel_stevens] finishes stitching [ms_lu]. [isobel_stevens] tries to communicate with [ms_lu] in Chinese but cannot understand.
[isobel_stevens] tells [ms_lu] that [isobel_stevens] has other patients, and [ms_lu] leaves. [alex_karev] mentions that [alex_karev] has a headache. [cristina_yang] jokingly hopes it is a brain tumor so [cristina_yang] can scrub in and confront [alex_karev]. [isobel_stevens] enters and says [isobel_stevens] has been suturing all day. [george_omalley] points out that at least [isobel_stevens] is helping people. [alex_karev] adds that [isobel_stevens] is practicing medicine. [isobel_stevens] starts to talk about [ms_lu], but [cristina_yang] ignores [isobel_stevens]. [meredith_grey] arrives and informs them that the police cannot take the penis, so [meredith_grey] must keep it overnight. They all express their frustrations about being interns. [miranda_bailey] enters with an eager expression, and the interns exit. [meredith_grey] sees the baby's parents, Mr. and [mrs_johnson], and expresses her worries about their child. The pediatric intern tells [meredith_grey] that [meredith_grey] overstepped by suggesting the heart murmur might not be harmless. The pediatric intern then gets [dr_kay], her resident. [dr_kay] asks what the issue is, and Mr. and [mrs_johnson] say they want treatment if their child is sick. [dr_kay] inquires who informed them of this, and the pediatric intern replies it was [meredith_grey]. When [dr_kay] asks if [meredith_grey] is allowed to be there, [preston_burke] confirms he authorized [meredith_grey]'s presence. [preston_burke] questions the pediatric intern about her certainty regarding the murmur's benign nature. The pediatric intern states she is 75% sure.
[preston_burke] then mentions that the baby is now under [preston_burke]'s care and introduces himself to Mr. and [mrs_johnson]. The pediatric intern asks [dr_kay] if [preston_burke] can take patients, and [dr_kay] confirms [preston_burke] can since [preston_burke] is an attending physician. [preston_burke] introduces himself to Mr. and [mrs_johnson] and gives [meredith_grey] some instructions. [isobel_stevens] finishes her suturing for the day. [isobel_stevens] sees [ms_lu], who calls [isobel_stevens] outside. There, [isobel_stevens] meets a girl named [ahn]. [ahn] has a large cut on her forehead. [isobel_stevens] offers to help and examines [ahn]'s injury. [ahn] explains that a machine broke in the factory and hurt [ahn]. [isobel_stevens] suggests they go inside, but [ahn] refuses. [ahn] is scared of going to jail because [ahn] doesn't have a green card. [isobel_stevens] tells [ahn] to wait while [isobel_stevens] gets supplies. [meredith_grey] asks [preston_burke] about a baby. [preston_burke] tells [meredith_grey] it has a birth defect. [meredith_grey] thanks [preston_burke] for his help. [preston_burke] warns [meredith_grey] that if [meredith_grey] does something like that again, [preston_burke] will make [meredith_grey]'s residency very difficult. Meanwhile, [george_omalley] is trying to resuscitate a patient. [cristina_yang] keeps giving lab results to a patient.
[ahn] hugs [isobel_stevens] several times.
[isobel_stevens] gathers supplies to stitch [ahn]'s forehead.
[derek_shepherd] sits next to [allison]'s bedside.
[george_omalley] announces the time of death for a patient who has flatlined.
[isobel_stevens] stitches [ahn]'s forehead and mentions [isobel_stevens] could have done a better job with more light.
[ahn] reassures [isobel_stevens] that it looks good.
[isobel_stevens] instructs [ahn] and the accompanying person to return in five days to remove the stitches and gives them [isobel_stevens] Stevens' pager number.
[isobel_stevens] warns them not to tell anyone [isobel_stevens] helped them, as it could cost [isobel_stevens] Stevens' job.
As [ahn] and the accompanying person start to leave, [ms_lu] returns and thanks [isobel_stevens] in her language before leaving.
[preston_burke] asks [miranda_bailey] if [preston_burke] is too confident.
[miranda_bailey] replies no, but [preston_burke] feels [miranda_bailey] is not being honest.
[preston_burke] tells [miranda_bailey] that anything [miranda_bailey] says in the next thirty seconds is free.
[miranda_bailey] starts listing all the bad things about a person.
[preston_burke] tries to interrupt, but [miranda_bailey] insists she is not finished.
In the locker room, [cristina_yang] says she needs a drink, a man, and a massage.
[george_omalley] mentions he lost five patients, but [cristina_yang] tells [george_omalley] that most patients in code are already dead by the time [george_omalley] arrives.
[cristina_yang] then leaves.
[meredith_grey] sits in a rocking chair in the nursery.
A pediatric intern expresses that the pediatric intern thought the pediatric intern was correct. [meredith_grey] responds that interns are usually wrong. The pediatric intern then asks [meredith_grey] if [meredith_grey] feels scared. When [meredith_grey] confirms that [meredith_grey] does, the pediatric intern feels relieved that the pediatric intern is not alone in the fear. [meredith_grey] asks [derek_shepherd] about [allison]'s condition. [derek_shepherd] replies that there has been no change. [derek_shepherd] shares that [derek_shepherd] has four sisters, and if [derek_shepherd] were in a coma, all four sisters would be there. [derek_shepherd] talks about [derek_shepherd]'s relationship, but the discussion shifts back to [allison], who feels alone. As they speak, [allison]'s condition worsens. [derek_shepherd] instructs the team to prepare the operating room for an emergency craniotomy. After the surgery, [derek_shepherd] updates [meredith_grey] about [allison]. [meredith_grey] asks if [allison] will survive, and [derek_shepherd] replies that [allison] will be fine if [allison] wakes up. [derek_shepherd] then asks [preston_burke] about the drink that [derek_shepherd] and [preston_burke] had discussed. [preston_burke] declines, stating that [derek_shepherd] is just competition for Chief of Surgery, and [preston_burke] walks away. [meredith_grey] works on a paper about a penis box with [patricia_clarkson]'s help. [richard_webber] tries to say "penis" but struggles. [richard_webber] mentions that it shouldn't be awkward since [richard_webber] is a doctor, but [richard_webber] used to change [meredith_grey]'s diapers. [richard_webber] then gives the penis box to the police, and [meredith_grey] leaves.
Meanwhile, the Johnson baby is in surgery. [preston_burke] explains the procedure to the team. [preston_burke] starts to open the baby's chest and tells [meredith_grey] to scrub in, as [preston_burke] will let [meredith_grey] hold the clamp. [meredith_grey] goes to the scrub room. [derek_shepherd] enters the rapist's room and hits the end of the bed, waking the man. [derek_shepherd] informs the rapist that [miranda_bailey] stopped the rapist's bleeding, but the police took the rapist's penis. [derek_shepherd] then leaves. The rapist realizes he is handcuffed to the bed. [cristina_yang] and [alex_karev] provide more test results. [cristina_yang] tells a patient that the patient's tumor is benign, so the patient can go home. The patient hugs the patient's husband, who then approaches [cristina_yang]. [cristina_yang] quickly pushes [alex_karev] in front of her. [alex_karev] receives the hug, and [cristina_yang] leaves, feeling satisfied. [preston_burke] operates on the baby while [meredith_grey] holds the clamp. The interns are watching the babies in the nursery. [meredith_grey] tells [isobel_stevens] and [george_omalley] they can move in, and [isobel_stevens] and [george_omalley] get excited and hug each other. [allison] starts to wake up, and [derek_shepherd] greets [allison]. [meredith_grey] goes to the elevator where [derek_shepherd] is waiting.
[george_omalley] mentions that [george_omalley] has a strong interest in ferry boats. After thinking about it, [cristina_yang] decides to take the stairs instead. [derek_shepherd] feels sorry for [cristina_yang]'s lack of self-control. [meredith_grey] leaves the hospital to join [george_omalley], [isobel_stevens], and [cristina_yang].
