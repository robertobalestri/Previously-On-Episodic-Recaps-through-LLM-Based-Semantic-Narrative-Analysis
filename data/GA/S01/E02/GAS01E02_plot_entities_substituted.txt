As [miranda_bailey] goes upstairs, [meredith_grey] asks to assist in the OR and offers [miranda_bailey] a mocha latte.
The interns crowd [miranda_bailey], saying if [meredith_grey] gets to cut, they should too.
[miranda_bailey] says the interns' job is to make [miranda_bailey] happy, which [miranda_bailey] isn't.
[miranda_bailey] takes the mocha latte and leaves, saying the interns won't use a scalpel until [miranda_bailey] is as happy as Mary Poppins.
[meredith_grey] goes to an elevator where [derek_shepherd] is waiting.
[derek_shepherd] recently learned Seattle has ferry boats.
[derek_shepherd] didn't know because [derek_shepherd] has lived there for only six weeks.
When the doors open, [derek_shepherd] mentions [derek_shepherd] is from New York.
As the doors close, [meredith_grey] says [meredith_grey] won't date [derek_shepherd].
[derek_shepherd] replies [derek_shepherd] never asked but wonders if [meredith_grey] wants to.

[derek_shepherd] says [allison] fought well since the rape kit was negative.
[preston_burke] calls [allison] a warrior.
[meredith_grey] says the victim's name is [allison].
[preston_burke] found the cause of the rupture but doesn't know what it is.
[meredith_grey] says it's the rapist's penis, and the doctors react with disgust.
[derek_shepherd] and [preston_burke] scrub out and discuss [allison]'s recovery.
[preston_burke] suggests getting a drink later.
[derek_shepherd] says there's nothing to tell about leaving New York; [richard_webber] made [derek_shepherd] an offer [derek_shepherd] couldn't refuse.
[george_omalley] brags to [cristina_yang] about being on the code team.
[cristina_yang] tells [george_omalley] to stop talking.

[meredith_grey] explains [meredith_grey]'s mother is just taking a break.
[meredith_grey] says [meredith_grey] was told to bring the "penis box" to [richard_webber].
[richard_webber] corrects [meredith_grey], saying the police need it.
[richard_webber] instructs [meredith_grey] to keep it with her because all medical items must stay with the person who collected them until given to the police.
[cristina_yang] and [alex_karev] give lab results to a family.
