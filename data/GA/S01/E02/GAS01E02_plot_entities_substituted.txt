[meredith_grey] enters the locker room and places a notice for a roommate on the bulletin board. [george_omalley] parks his car and heads to the hospital. [george_omalley] realizes he forgot his badge and has to go back. While retrieving the badge, [george_omalley] accidentally honks his horn. [izzie_stevens] calls for an elevator. When the doors open, [izzie_stevens] finds the elevator full of men who stare at [izzie_stevens], making [izzie_stevens] feel uncomfortable. [cristina_yang] arrives at the hospital on her motorcycle and nearly runs over [george_omalley]. [cristina_yang] parks her motorcycle and rushes into the hospital. The interns are putting on their scrubs. [meredith_grey] places her leopard print shoes in her locker. [meredith_grey] talks to an intern interested in being [meredith_grey]'s roommate, but [meredith_grey] feels the intern is not a good match and declines. [izzie_stevens] questions [meredith_grey] about why [meredith_grey] posts roommate notices if [meredith_grey] seems uninterested in having one. [meredith_grey] says [meredith_grey] wants help. [cristina_yang] interrupts and points out that [meredith_grey] has a coffee for [miranda_bailey], calling it bribing. [george_omalley] mentions that [george_omalley]'s mom irons [george_omalley]'s scrubs and hints [george_omalley] wants to be [meredith_grey]'s roommate, but [meredith_grey] disagrees. [izzie_stevens] also asks to be a roommate, but [meredith_grey] declines. [meredith_grey] explains she wants two strangers who won't require [meredith_grey] to talk or be friendly. [miranda_bailey] arrives and assigns tasks to the interns.
As [miranda_bailey] walks up the stairs, [meredith_grey] asks to assist [miranda_bailey] in the OR and offers a mocha latte. The interns quickly gather around [miranda_bailey], arguing that if [meredith_grey] gets to cut, they should too. [miranda_bailey] responds that their job is to make their resident happy, which [miranda_bailey] isn't. [miranda_bailey] takes the mocha latte and leaves, stating they won't hold a scalpel until [miranda_bailey] is as happy as Mary Poppins. [meredith_grey] then heads to an elevator where [dr_derek_shepherd] is waiting. [dr_derek_shepherd] learns that Seattle has ferry boats, which surprises [dr_derek_shepherd] since [dr_derek_shepherd] has only lived there for six weeks. When the doors open, [dr_derek_shepherd] introduces himself as being from New York. After the doors close, [meredith_grey] tells [dr_derek_shepherd] she will not go out with him. [dr_derek_shepherd] replies that [dr_derek_shepherd] never asked but inquires if [meredith_grey] wants to. [meredith_grey] declines and states she won't sleep with [dr_derek_shepherd] because [dr_derek_shepherd] is her boss. [dr_derek_shepherd] brushes [meredith_grey] off, and [meredith_grey] accuses [dr_derek_shepherd] of sexual harassment. [meredith_grey] asserts that [meredith_grey] is setting a boundary, and [dr_derek_shepherd] jokingly asks if [meredith_grey] needs a marker. [meredith_grey] glares at [dr_derek_shepherd], drops her folders, and they kiss until the doors open again. [meredith_grey] picks up her folders and exits. [meredith_grey] then arrives at a trauma room where a nurse informs [meredith_grey] about a rape victim found in the park with serious injuries. [meredith_grey] starts to lose focus when [meredith_grey] notices the victim's shoes are the same as [meredith_grey]'s. A nurse calls [meredith_grey]'s name, bringing [meredith_grey] back to reality. [meredith_grey] begins giving orders.
The rape victim, [allison], is currently in surgery. [dr_derek_shepherd] mentions that [allison] will need a long recovery and rehab. [dr_derek_shepherd] is surprised [allison] survived after what happened to her. [preston_burke] observes that [allison] fought back. [dr_derek_shepherd] responds that [allison] was strong since the rape kit showed no evidence of assault. [preston_burke] calls [allison] a warrior, but [meredith_grey] says her name is [allison]. [preston_burke] discovers the cause of the injury but is unsure what it is. He asks the others in the room, and [meredith_grey] states it is the rapist's penis, causing the doctors to mumble in disgust. As [dr_derek_shepherd] and [preston_burke] finish scrubbing, they talk about [allison]'s recovery. [preston_burke] suggests they get a drink later. [preston_burke] wants to know why [dr_derek_shepherd] left New York for Seattle. [dr_derek_shepherd] replies that he has nothing to share; [richard_webber] made him an offer he couldn't refuse, and then [dr_derek_shepherd] leaves. [george_omalley] boasts to [cristina_yang] about being on the code team, but [cristina_yang] tells [george_omalley] to stop talking. [cristina_yang] has a Bachelor’s degree from Smith, a PhD from Berkeley, and an MD from Stanford. [cristina_yang] is working on labs and says it will take her all day to finish them. [miranda_bailey] hears this and tells [cristina_yang] to start. [cristina_yang] tries to explain that she wasn't complaining, but [miranda_bailey] interrupts. [miranda_bailey] mentions she has an intern who needs guidance from [cristina_yang].
[alex_karev] introduces himself as [alex_karev].
[cristina_yang] remembers that [alex_karev] called [meredith_grey] a nurse, so [cristina_yang] tells [alex_karev] she dislikes him.
[alex_karev] replies that [alex_karev] feels the same way as [alex_karev] and [cristina_yang] walk away.
[george_omalley]'s pager goes off, and [george_omalley] leaves too.
[george_omalley] runs down a corridor with the code team following [george_omalley].
The patient is in critical condition and has no heartbeat.
[george_omalley] starts giving orders and tells a nurse to charge the paddles.
[izzie_stevens] tells [ms_lu], a Chinese woman, that [ms_lu] needs six stitches.
[izzie_stevens] asks [ms_lu] if [ms_lu] is allergic to any medication.
[ms_lu] responds in Cantonese, asking if [izzie_stevens] speaks Cantonese and requesting help.
[izzie_stevens] then asks [ms_lu] if [ms_lu] knows any English.
[ms_lu] replies in Cantonese again, saying [ms_lu]'s daughter is outside with worse injuries, while [ms_lu] has only hurt her arm.
[izzie_stevens] asks the room if anyone speaks Chinese, but no one responds.
Meanwhile, [meredith_grey] arrives at [richard_webber]'s office.
Patricia is there and notices a box containing the rapist's penis.
Patricia asks to see it but quickly changes Patricia's mind.
[richard_webber] enters and mentions he heard [ellis_grey] is leaving Mayo.
[meredith_grey] explains that [ellis_grey] is just taking a break.
[meredith_grey] tells [richard_webber] that [meredith_grey] was instructed to bring the "penis box" to [richard_webber].
[richard_webber] corrects [meredith_grey], stating that the police need it.
[richard_webber] explains that until then, [meredith_grey] must keep it, as all medical items must stay with the person who collected them until they are handed over to the police.
[cristina_yang] and [alex_karev] give lab results to a family.
[cristina_yang] and [alex_karev] inform the patient about a disorder called multinucleate cell angiohistiocytoma.
[cristina_yang] and [alex_karev] explain it is not a cancerous sarcoma and is a very rare but minor disease.
The family feels relieved, and one family member hugs [cristina_yang].
[cristina_yang] glares at [alex_karev], who smiles at [cristina_yang].
[meredith_grey] places a box on a counter where [george_omalley] is working.
[george_omalley] asks [meredith_grey] what it is.
[meredith_grey] tells [george_omalley] he doesn't want to know, but [george_omalley] insists he does.
[meredith_grey] then reveals its contents, and [george_omalley] regrets asking.
[cristina_yang] and [alex_karev] walk by.
[cristina_yang] complains about being hugged all the time.
[alex_karev] responds that it’s because [cristina_yang] is an ovarian sister.
[cristina_yang] feels insulted.
[george_omalley] then mentions that [meredith_grey] is carrying a penis in a jar.
[cristina_yang] looks at it, makes a joke, and leaves.
[george_omalley] asks [meredith_grey] if [meredith_grey] is okay.
[meredith_grey] explains that [allison] has the same uncomfortable shoes that [meredith_grey] is wearing.
[meredith_grey] mentions that [meredith_grey] rarely wears those shoes, but chose to wear them that day.
[meredith_grey] thinks the situation is foolish.
[george_omalley] believes he understands [meredith_grey]'s needs, but [meredith_grey] disagrees.
[george_omalley] offers [meredith_grey] a choice: join [george_omalley] or stay unhappy.
[george_omalley] and [meredith_grey] are outside the nursery, observing the babies.
[george_omalley]'s pager goes off, and [george_omalley] informs [meredith_grey] that it's an emergency, so [george_omalley] leaves.
While watching the babies, [meredith_grey] notices one baby’s face turning blue.
[meredith_grey] enters the nursery to check on the baby.
A pediatric intern arrives and asks [meredith_grey] what [meredith_grey] is doing.
[meredith_grey] explains that the baby has a murmur.
The intern acknowledges this, but [meredith_grey] is surprised and points out that the baby turned blue.
The intern tells [meredith_grey] that [meredith_grey] is not authorized to be there.
[meredith_grey] inquires about tests, but the intern reassures [meredith_grey] that it is benign and will resolve with age.
[meredith_grey] is told to leave, and [meredith_grey] does.
[izzie_stevens] brings [cristina_yang], thinking [izzie_stevens] can translate for [ms_lu].
[ms_lu] keeps saying that [ms_lu]'s daughter is outside with a head injury, and [ms_lu] wants to help, but [ms_lu] can't.
[cristina_yang] explains that [cristina_yang] is from Beverly Hills and only knows some Chinese from a menu.
[cristina_yang] also mentions that [cristina_yang] is Korean and then leaves.
[preston_burke] asks [richard_webber] why [richard_webber] invited [dr_derek_shepherd] to Seattle Grace.
[richard_webber] explains that [dr_derek_shepherd] was [richard_webber]'s former student.
[preston_burke] realizes there might be another reason and mentions that the Chief of Surgery position is [preston_burke]'s.
[richard_webber] replies that [richard_webber] won't be leaving soon, and [preston_burke] storms off.
Meanwhile, [cristina_yang] is talking to [alex_karev].
[cristina_yang] asks [alex_karev] how they will get OR time.
[cristina_yang] gathers her files and gives some to [alex_karev], telling [alex_karev] to hurry.
[cristina_yang] and [alex_karev] leave together.
[cristina_yang] and [alex_karev] deliver lab results to several patients.
[cristina_yang] feels annoyed after one patient hugs [cristina_yang].
[george_omalley] rushes into a patient room with the code team.
The patient flatlines, and [george_omalley] has to declare time of death.
[meredith_grey] asks some interns about their favorite 80s band.
When the interns answer incorrectly, [meredith_grey] walks away.
While [meredith_grey] is looking at [allison], [dr_derek_shepherd] approaches [meredith_grey].
[dr_derek_shepherd] tells [meredith_grey] that the rapist will eventually need medical help and that [meredith_grey] has evidence against him.
[meredith_grey] inquires about [meredith_grey]'s family.
[dr_derek_shepherd] informs [meredith_grey] that [meredith_grey]'s parents are dead and that [meredith_grey] has no siblings.
[dr_derek_shepherd] then asks if [meredith_grey] is okay, and [meredith_grey] replies that [meredith_grey] is fine.
[meredith_grey] later asks [preston_burke] about a baby [meredith_grey] saw turning blue in pediatrics.
[preston_burke] states that [preston_burke] cannot proceed without a pediatric consult.
[izzie_stevens] is busy bandaging a man's hand.
The man attempts to flirt with [izzie_stevens], but [izzie_stevens] realizes the man is drunk.
The man mentions that the man thinks he recognizes [izzie_stevens] from a magazine.
[izzie_stevens] acknowledges this and tells the man to leave.
[ms_lu] arrives and sits down.
[izzie_stevens] starts stitching [ms_lu]'s arm while [ms_lu] speaks in Chinese.
[izzie_stevens] remains silent.
Meanwhile, [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] are in the lobby talking.
After a while, [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] notice a truck entering the parking lot.
[meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] go outside and see a man covered in blood, especially around the man's crotch.
The man collapses, and doctors and nurses rush to the man.
[meredith_grey] realizes the man is the rapist.
Inside, [meredith_grey] calls for security and shows [miranda_bailey] the rapist.
[miranda_bailey] tells [meredith_grey] to take the rapist to OR 1 and inform [richard_webber]. While the rapist is in surgery, [cristina_yang] and [meredith_grey] discuss [allison] and the rapist. [miranda_bailey] asks why they don't reattach the rapist's penis. [meredith_grey] explains they can't reattach it without a clean cut, and [allison]'s digestive juices left little to work with. [meredith_grey] adds that the rapist will be using a bag to pee for a long time. [cristina_yang] notes the rapist will never be able to have sex again, which [cristina_yang] thinks is unfortunate. [miranda_bailey] sarcastically suggests they should take a moment to grieve, and then [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] return to surgery. [richard_webber] leaves an operating room and tells [preston_burke] they have the rapist. The conversation shifts when [preston_burke] asks why he can't be Chief. [richard_webber] responds that [richard_webber] only does what is necessary and nothing more. Then, [richard_webber] walks away. [dr_derek_shepherd] is worried about [allison]'s recovery. [izzie_stevens] finishes stitching [ms_lu]. [izzie_stevens] tries to communicate in Chinese, but [izzie_stevens] cannot understand [ms_lu]. [izzie_stevens] tells [ms_lu] she has other patients, and [ms_lu] leaves. [alex_karev] mentions he has a headache. [cristina_yang] jokingly hopes [alex_karev]'s headache is a brain tumor so [cristina_yang] can scrub in and confront [alex_karev]. [izzie_stevens] enters and says [izzie_stevens] has been suturing all day.
[george_omalley] points out that at least [izzie_stevens] is helping people.
[alex_karev] adds that [izzie_stevens] is practicing medicine.
[izzie_stevens] starts to talk about [ms_lu], but [cristina_yang] ignores [izzie_stevens].
[meredith_grey] arrives and informs [george_omalley], [alex_karev], and [izzie_stevens] that the police cannot take the penis, so [meredith_grey] must keep it overnight.
They all express their frustrations about being interns.
[miranda_bailey] enters, looking hopeful, while the interns exit.
[meredith_grey] sees the baby's parents, Mr. and [mrs_johnson], and expresses her worries about their child.
The pediatric intern tells [meredith_grey] she is overstepping because she mentioned the murmur might not be harmless.
The pediatric intern then gets Dr. Kay, her resident.
Dr. Kay asks what the issue is, and Mr. and [mrs_johnson] say they want treatment if their child is sick.
Dr. Kay inquires who informed them, and the pediatric intern replies it was [meredith_grey].
When Dr. Kay asks if [meredith_grey] is allowed to be there, [preston_burke] confirms that he authorized [meredith_grey]'s presence.
[preston_burke] then asks the pediatric intern if she is completely sure the murmur is benign.
The pediatric intern responds that she is 75% sure.
[preston_burke] states that the baby is now under his care and introduces himself to Mr. and [mrs_johnson].
The pediatric intern questions Dr. Kay about [preston_burke] taking patients, and Dr. Kay explains that [preston_burke] can do so because he is an attending physician.
[preston_burke] introduces himself to Mr. and [mrs_johnson] and gives [meredith_grey] some instructions.
[izzie_stevens] finishes her suturing for the day.
[izzie_stevens] sees [ms_lu] outside with a girl named [ahn].
[ahn] has a large cut on her forehead.
[izzie_stevens] approaches and offers to help.
[izzie_stevens] examines [ahn]'s injury.
[ahn] explains that a machine broke in the factory and hurt [ahn].
[izzie_stevens] asks [ms_lu] and [ahn] to come inside, but [ahn] refuses.
[ahn] is afraid of going to jail because [ahn] doesn't have a green card.
[izzie_stevens] tells [ms_lu] and [ahn] to wait while [izzie_stevens] gets supplies.
[meredith_grey] asks [preston_burke] about a baby.
[preston_burke] informs [meredith_grey] that the baby has a birth defect.
[meredith_grey] thanks [preston_burke] for his help.
[preston_burke] warns [meredith_grey] that if [meredith_grey] does something like that again, [preston_burke] will make [meredith_grey]'s residency very difficult.
Meanwhile, [george_omalley] is trying to resuscitate a patient.
[cristina_yang] delivers lab results to a patient.
The patient hugs [cristina_yang] repeatedly.
[izzie_stevens] gathers supplies to stitch [ahn]'s forehead.
[dr_derek_shepherd] sits by [allison]'s bedside.
[george_omalley] declares a patient dead after the patient flatlines.
[izzie_stevens] stitches [ahn]'s forehead and mentions [izzie_stevens] could have done better with more light. [ahn] reassures [izzie_stevens] that [ahn]'s forehead looks good. [izzie_stevens] instructs [ahn] to return in five days to remove the stitches and gives [ahn] her pager number. [izzie_stevens] warns [ahn] not to tell anyone [izzie_stevens] helped [ahn], as it could cost [izzie_stevens]'s job. [ahn] starts to leave, but [ms_lu] returns and thanks [izzie_stevens] in [ms_lu]'s language before leaving. [preston_burke] asks [miranda_bailey] if [preston_burke] is too confident. [miranda_bailey] replies no, but [preston_burke] feels [miranda_bailey] is not being honest. [preston_burke] tells [miranda_bailey] that anything [miranda_bailey] says in the next thirty seconds is free. [miranda_bailey] starts talking about the bad things related to [preston_burke]. [preston_burke] tries to speak, but [miranda_bailey] insists [miranda_bailey] is not finished. In the locker room, [cristina_yang] expresses [cristina_yang]'s need for a drink, a man, and a massage. [george_omalley] mentions [george_omalley] lost five patients, but [cristina_yang] points out that most patients in critical condition are already dead by the time [george_omalley] arrives, and then [cristina_yang] leaves. [meredith_grey] sits in a rocking chair in the nursery. A pediatric intern says the pediatric intern thought the pediatric intern was correct. [meredith_grey] replies that interns are usually wrong. The pediatric intern then asks [meredith_grey] if [meredith_grey] feels scared. When [meredith_grey] confirms this, the pediatric intern feels relieved that the pediatric intern is not alone. [meredith_grey] asks [dr_derek_shepherd] about [allison]'s condition, and [dr_derek_shepherd] tells [meredith_grey] there is no change.
[dr_derek_shepherd] shares that [dr_derek_shepherd] has four sisters, and if [dr_derek_shepherd] were in a coma, all of [dr_derek_shepherd]'s sisters would be there.
[dr_derek_shepherd] talks about [dr_derek_shepherd]'s relationship with [meredith_grey].
The conversation shifts to [allison], who feels alone.
As [dr_derek_shepherd] and [meredith_grey] speak, [allison]'s condition worsens.
[dr_derek_shepherd] tells the team to prepare the operating room for an emergency craniotomy.
After the surgery, [dr_derek_shepherd] updates [meredith_grey] on [allison]'s status.
[dr_derek_shepherd] tells [meredith_grey] that [allison] will be okay if [allison] wakes up.
[dr_derek_shepherd] asks [preston_burke] about the drink that [dr_derek_shepherd] and [preston_burke] had discussed.
[preston_burke] declines, stating that [dr_derek_shepherd] is just competition for Chief of Surgery.
[preston_burke] then walks away.
[meredith_grey] works on a paper about a penis box, with Patricia assisting [meredith_grey].
[richard_webber] tries to say "penis."
[richard_webber] thinks it shouldn't be awkward since [richard_webber] is a doctor, but [richard_webber] recalls changing [meredith_grey]'s diapers.
[richard_webber] then gives the penis box to the police, and [meredith_grey] leaves.
Meanwhile, the Johnson baby is in surgery.
[preston_burke] explains the procedure to the team.
[preston_burke] starts to open the Johnson baby's chest and tells [meredith_grey] to scrub in, as [preston_burke] will let [meredith_grey] hold the clamp.
[meredith_grey] goes to the scrub room.
[dr_derek_shepherd] enters the rapist's room and hits the end of the bed, waking the rapist. [dr_derek_shepherd] informs the rapist that [miranda_bailey] stopped the rapist's bleeding, but the police took the rapist's penis. [dr_derek_shepherd] then leaves. The rapist notices the rapist is handcuffed to the bed. [cristina_yang] and [alex_karev] provide more test results. [cristina_yang] tells a patient that the patient's tumor is benign, so the patient can go home. The patient hugs the patient's husband, who then approaches [cristina_yang]. [cristina_yang] quickly pushes [alex_karev] into the husband's path. [alex_karev] receives the hug, and [cristina_yang] walks away, feeling satisfied. [preston_burke] is performing surgery on a baby while [meredith_grey] holds the clamp. The interns are watching the babies in the nursery. [meredith_grey] tells [izzie_stevens] and [george_omalley] they can move in. [izzie_stevens] and [george_omalley] feel excited and hug each other. [allison] starts to wake up, and [dr_derek_shepherd] greets [allison]. [meredith_grey] goes to an elevator where [dr_derek_shepherd] is waiting. [dr_derek_shepherd] mentions his strong interest in ferry boats. After thinking about it, [meredith_grey] decides to take the stairs instead. [dr_derek_shepherd] feels sorry for [meredith_grey]'s lack of self-control.
[meredith_grey] leaves the hospital to join [george_omalley], [izzie_stevens], and [cristina_yang].
