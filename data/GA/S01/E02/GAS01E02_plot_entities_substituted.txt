[meredith_grey] goes into the locker room and posts a notice about needing a roommate.
[george_omalley] parks his car at the hospital but forgets his badge, so [george_omalley] goes back to get it and accidentally honks the horn.
[isobel_stevens] calls an elevator, and when it opens, it's full of men staring at [isobel_stevens], making her feel uneasy.
[cristina_yang] arrives at the hospital on her motorcycle and nearly hits [george_omalley].
[cristina_yang] quickly parks and runs inside.
The interns start putting on their scrubs.
[meredith_grey] places her leopard print shoes in her locker.
[meredith_grey] talks to an intern interested in being her roommate but decides the intern isn't suitable and declines.
[isobel_stevens] questions [meredith_grey] about why [meredith_grey] posts roommate notices if she seems uninterested in having one.
[meredith_grey] confirms she has a coffee for [miranda_bailey].
[cristina_yang] notices and accuses [meredith_grey] of bribing.
[george_omalley] mentions his mom irons his scrubs and hints he wants to be [meredith_grey]'s roommate, but [meredith_grey] disagrees.
[isobel_stevens] also tries to ask, but [meredith_grey] refuses.
[meredith_grey] explains she wants two strangers as roommates so she doesn't have to interact with them.
[miranda_bailey] arrives and gives the interns their tasks.
As [miranda_bailey] goes upstairs, [meredith_grey] asks to assist in the OR and offers a mocha latte.
The interns crowd [miranda_bailey], insisting if [meredith_grey] gets to assist, they should too.
[miranda_bailey] tells them their job is to make their resident happy, which [miranda_bailey] isn't.
[miranda_bailey] takes the mocha latte and says the interns won't use a scalpel until [miranda_bailey] is as happy as Mary Poppins.
[meredith_grey] then heads to an elevator where [derek_shepherd] is waiting.
[derek_shepherd] recently discovered that Seattle has ferry boats because [derek_shepherd] has only lived there for six weeks.
As the elevator doors open, [derek_shepherd] mentions he's from New York.
When the doors close, [meredith_grey] tells [derek_shepherd] she won't date him.
[derek_shepherd] responds that he never asked, but inquires if [meredith_grey] would like to.
[meredith_grey] declines and adds she won't sleep with [derek_shepherd] because he is her boss.
[derek_shepherd] dismisses [meredith_grey]'s comment, and [meredith_grey] accuses [derek_shepherd] of sexual harassment.
[meredith_grey] insists she's setting boundaries, and [derek_shepherd] jokingly asks if [meredith_grey] needs a marker.
[meredith_grey] glares at [derek_shepherd], drops her folders, and they kiss until the doors open.
[meredith_grey] then picks up her folders and leaves.
[meredith_grey] goes to a trauma room where a nurse informs her about a rape victim found in the park with severe injuries.
[meredith_grey] notices the victim's shoes are like hers and starts to zone out.
A nurse calls [meredith_grey], and she quickly begins giving orders.
The rape victim is in surgery.
[derek_shepherd] mentions the victim will need a lot of recovery and rehab time.
[derek_shepherd] is surprised the victim survived the attack.
[preston_burke] observes the victim tried to fight back.
[derek_shepherd] comments that [allison] fought hard since the rape kit was negative.
[preston_burke] calls [allison] a warrior, but [meredith_grey] says her name is [allison].
[preston_burke] identifies the cause of the rupture but doesn't know what it is.
[meredith_grey] explains it's the rapist's penis, and the doctors react with disgust.
As [derek_shepherd] and [preston_burke] finish up, they talk about [allison]'s recovery.
[preston_burke] suggests getting a drink later and asks [derek_shepherd] why [derek_shepherd] left New York for Seattle.
[derek_shepherd] says there's nothing to tell; [webber] made [derek_shepherd] an offer [derek_shepherd] couldn't refuse and leaves.
[george_omalley] boasts to [cristina_yang] about being on the code team, but [cristina_yang] tells [george_omalley] to stop talking.
[cristina_yang] claims she has a B.A. from Smith, a PhD from Berkeley, and an M.D. from Stanford.
[cristina_yang] is delivering labs and says it will take her all day.
[miranda_bailey] overhears and tells [cristina_yang] to get started.
[cristina_yang] tries to explain she wasn't complaining, but [miranda_bailey] insists.
[miranda_bailey] mentions she has reassigned an intern to [cristina_yang].
[cristina_yang] should show the intern how [miranda_bailey] operates.
The intern introduces himself as [alex_karev].
[cristina_yang] recalls [alex_karev] called [meredith_grey] a nurse and tells [alex_karev] she dislikes him on principle.
[alex_karev] responds that he feels the same as [alex_karev] and [cristina_yang] walk away.
[george_omalley]'s pager beeps, and [george_omalley] leaves.
[george_omalley] runs down a corridor with the code team following.
The patient is crashing and has no heartbeat.
[george_omalley] starts giving orders and instructs a nurse to charge the paddles.
[isobel_stevens] tells [ms_lu], a Chinese woman, that [ms_lu] needs six stitches and asks about any medication allergies.
[ms_lu] speaks in Cantonese, asking if [isobel_stevens] understands Cantonese and can help her.
[isobel_stevens] then asks if [ms_lu] knows any English.
[ms_lu] replies in Cantonese, saying her daughter outside has worse injuries, while [ms_lu] only hurt her arm.
[isobel_stevens] asks if anyone in the room speaks Chinese, but no one responds.
[meredith_grey] goes to the Chief's office.
[patricia] is there and realizes the box contains the rapist's penis.
[patricia] asks to see it but quickly changes her mind.
[richard_webber] enters and mentions hearing that [meredith_grey]'s mother is leaving Mayo.
[meredith_grey] explains her mother is just taking a break.
[meredith_grey] tells [richard_webber] she was instructed to bring the "penis box" to him.
[richard_webber] corrects [meredith_grey], saying the police need it, and she must keep it until it is handed over to them, as all medical evidence must stay with the collector until police custody.
[cristina_yang] and [alex_karev] give lab results to a family.
[cristina_yang] and [alex_karev] inform the patient about a disorder called multinucleate cell angiohistiocytoma.
It's not cancerous, just a rare and minor disease.
The patient will be discharged that day.
The family feels relieved, and one member hugs [cristina_yang].
[cristina_yang] glares at [alex_karev], who smiles at her.
[meredith_grey] places a box on a counter where [george_omalley] is working.
[george_omalley] asks about it, and [meredith_grey] says he doesn't want to know.
[george_omalley] insists, so [meredith_grey] tells him.
[george_omalley] regrets asking.
[cristina_yang] and [alex_karev] walk by, and [cristina_yang] complains about being hugged often.
[alex_karev] says it's because [cristina_yang] is an ovarian sister, which insults her.
[george_omalley] mentions [meredith_grey] is carrying a penis in a jar.
[cristina_yang] looks, jokes about it, and leaves.
[george_omalley] asks [meredith_grey] if she's okay.
[meredith_grey] explains that [allison] has the same shoes she wore that day.
[meredith_grey] finds them uncomfortable and rarely wears them.
[meredith_grey] thinks the situation is foolish.
[george_omalley] believes he knows what [meredith_grey] needs, but [meredith_grey] disagrees.
[george_omalley] insists [meredith_grey] can join him or remain unhappy.
[george_omalley] and [meredith_grey] are outside the nursery, observing the babies.
[george_omalley]'s pager goes off, indicating a code, so [george_omalley] leaves [meredith_grey].
While [meredith_grey] watches, one baby's face turns blue.
[meredith_grey] enters to check on the baby.
A pediatrics intern arrives and questions [meredith_grey]'s actions.
[meredith_grey] explains the baby has a murmur.
The intern acknowledges this, but [meredith_grey] is surprised and mentions the baby turned blue.
The intern informs [meredith_grey] she isn't authorized to be there.
[meredith_grey] asks about tests, but the intern says it's a benign condition that resolves with age.
[meredith_grey] is told to leave, and she does.
[isobel_stevens] brings [cristina_yang] to help translate for [ms_lu], thinking [cristina_yang] knows Chinese.
[ms_lu] repeatedly says her daughter is outside with a head injury and wants to help stitch it up but can't.
[cristina_yang] explains she is from Beverly Hills and only knows Chinese from a menu.
[cristina_yang] also mentions she is Korean and then leaves.
[preston_burke] asks [richard_webber] why [derek_shepherd] was invited to Seattle Grace.
[richard_webber] explains [derek_shepherd] is a former student.
[preston_burke] suspects another reason and claims the Chief of Surgery position is his.
[richard_webber] responds he won't be leaving soon, and [preston_burke] leaves angrily.
[cristina_yang] talks to [alex_karev].
[alex_karev] asked how they would get OR time.
[cristina_yang] grabbed her files, handed some to [alex_karev], and told him to hurry.
[cristina_yang] and [alex_karev] left together.
[cristina_yang] and [alex_karev] delivered lab results to several patients.
[cristina_yang] got annoyed when one patient hugged her.
[george_omalley] rushed into a patient room with the code team.
The patient flatlined, and [george_omalley] had to call the time of death.
[meredith_grey] asked some interns about their favorite 80s group.
The interns answered incorrectly, so [meredith_grey] left.
While [meredith_grey] was looking at [allison], [derek_shepherd] approached her.
[derek_shepherd] mentioned that the rapist would eventually need medical attention and that [meredith_grey] had evidence to catch him.
[meredith_grey] inquired about [allison]'s family.
[derek_shepherd] explained [allison] had none, as her parents were deceased and she had no siblings.
[derek_shepherd] asked [meredith_grey] if she was okay, and [meredith_grey] replied that she was fine.
[meredith_grey] then asked [preston_burke] about a baby she saw turning blue in pediatrics.
[preston_burke] mentioned he can't proceed without a pediatric consultation.
[isobel_stevens] finishes bandaging a man's hand. The man tries to flirt with [isobel_stevens], but she realizes he is drunk. The man thinks he recognizes [isobel_stevens] from a magazine. [isobel_stevens] acknowledges this and tells the man to leave. [ms_lu] sits down, and [isobel_stevens] starts stitching [ms_lu]'s arm. [ms_lu] speaks in Chinese, but [isobel_stevens] remains silent. [meredith_grey] talks to [cristina_yang] in the lobby. [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] notice a truck swerving into the parking lot. They go outside and see a man with blood-soaked clothes, especially around his crotch. The man collapses, and doctors and nurses gather around him. [meredith_grey] realizes the man is the rapist. Inside, [meredith_grey] calls security and shows [miranda_bailey] the rapist. [miranda_bailey] instructs [meredith_grey] to take the rapist to OR 1 and inform the Chief. During the surgery, [cristina_yang] and [meredith_grey] discuss [allison] and the rapist. [miranda_bailey] asks why they can't reattach the penis. [meredith_grey] explains they need a clean cut, and [allison]'s digestive juices damaged it. [meredith_grey] mentions the rapist will use a bag to pee for a long time. [cristina_yang] notes the rapist won't have sex again, calling it a shame.
[miranda_bailey] sarcastically suggests they mourn, then the team continues operating.
[richard_webber] finishes in an OR and tells [preston_burke] they have the rapist.
The conversation shifts when [preston_burke] asks [richard_webber] why he can't be Chief.
[richard_webber] responds that [preston_burke] only does what is necessary and nothing more, then walks away.
[derek_shepherd] is worried about [allison]'s recovery.
[isobel_stevens] finishes [ms_lu]'s stitches and hears [ms_lu] speak in Chinese again.
[isobel_stevens] tells [ms_lu] she can't understand and has other patients, so [ms_lu] leaves.
[alex_karev] complains about a headache.
[cristina_yang] sarcastically hopes it's a brain tumor, saying she'd rip [alex_karev]'s face off if she could assist in surgery.
[isobel_stevens] joins them and mentions she's been suturing all day.
[george_omalley] points out [isobel_stevens] is helping people, and [alex_karev] adds she's practicing medicine.
[isobel_stevens] talks about [ms_lu], but [cristina_yang] ignores her.
[meredith_grey] arrives and says the police can't pick up the penis, so she has to keep it overnight.
They all express frustration about being interns.
[miranda_bailey] enters, looking hopeful, and the interns leave.
[meredith_grey] sees the baby's parents and shares her worries.
The pediatric intern tells [meredith_grey] she's overstepping because she mentioned the murmur might not be harmless.
The intern brings her resident, [dr_kay].
[dr_kay] asks what's happening, and Mr. and [mrs_johnson] say they want treatment if their child is sick.
[dr_kay] inquires who informed them, and the intern points to [meredith_grey].
[dr_kay] asks if [meredith_grey] is allowed there, and [preston_burke] says he authorized it.
[preston_burke] questions the intern's certainty about the murmur being harmless.
When the intern says 75%, [preston_burke] takes over the case and introduces himself to Mr. and [mrs_johnson].
The intern asks [dr_kay] if [preston_burke] can take patients, and [dr_kay] confirms he can because he's an attending.
[preston_burke] introduces himself to Mr. and [mrs_johnson] again and gives [meredith_grey] instructions.
After [isobel_stevens] finishes suturing, [isobel_stevens] meets [ms_lu].
[ms_lu] is with a girl named [ahn], who has a large cut on her forehead.
[isobel_stevens] offers to help and examines the injury.
[ahn] explains that a machine broke at the factory and hurt her.
[isobel_stevens] suggests they go inside, but [ahn] refuses because she doesn't have a green card and fears jail.
[isobel_stevens] tells them to wait while she gets supplies.
Meanwhile, [meredith_grey] talks to [preston_burke] about a baby with a birth defect.
[meredith_grey] thanks [preston_burke] for his help, but he warns her not to repeat her actions or he will make her residency very difficult.
[george_omalley] is trying to revive a patient.
[cristina_yang] delivers lab results to a patient and gets hugged repeatedly.
[isobel_stevens] gathers supplies to stitch [ahn]'s forehead.
[derek_shepherd] sits by [allison]'s bedside.
[george_omalley] announces the time of death for a patient who flatlined.
[isobel_stevens] stitches [ahn]'s forehead and mentions she could have done better with more light.
[ahn] reassures [isobel_stevens] it's fine.
[isobel_stevens] instructs [ahn] to return in five days to remove the stitches and gives [ahn] her pager number.
[isobel_stevens] warns [ahn] not to tell anyone she helped, as she could lose her job.
As [ahn] leaves, [ms_lu] returns to thank [isobel_stevens] in her own language, then departs.
[preston_burke] asks [miranda_bailey] if [preston_burke] is too confident.
[miranda_bailey] says no, but [preston_burke] feels [miranda_bailey] is lying and tells [miranda_bailey] she can speak freely for the next thirty seconds.
[miranda_bailey] starts listing negative things about [preston_burke].
[preston_burke] tries to interrupt, but [miranda_bailey] insists she's not finished.
In the locker room, [cristina_yang] complains she needs a drink, a man, and a massage.
[george_omalley] mentions he lost five patients.
[cristina_yang] tells [george_omalley] most code patients are already dead before [george_omalley] arrives, then [cristina_yang] leaves.
[meredith_grey] sits in a rocking chair in the nursery.
The peds intern thought [meredith_grey] was right, but [meredith_grey] says interns are almost never right.
The intern asks [meredith_grey] if [meredith_grey] feels terrified.
[meredith_grey] says yes, and the intern feels relieved it's not just her.
[meredith_grey] asks [derek_shepherd] about [allison], and [derek_shepherd] says there's no change.
[derek_shepherd] mentions he has four sisters, and if [derek_shepherd] were in a coma, they'd all be there.
[derek_shepherd] talks about their relationship, but the focus shifts to [allison], who feels alone.
As they talk, [allison]'s condition worsens.
[derek_shepherd] tells the team to prepare the OR for an emergency craniotomy.
After the surgery, [derek_shepherd] updates [meredith_grey] about [allison].
[meredith_grey] asks if [allison] will survive, and [derek_shepherd] says she will if she wakes up.
[derek_shepherd] asks [preston_burke] about a drink they mentioned earlier.
[preston_burke] now declines, saying [derek_shepherd] is just competition for Chief of Surgery, and [preston_burke] walks away.
[meredith_grey] signs a paper about the penis box with [patricia]'s help.
[richard_webber] tries to say "penis," noting it shouldn't be awkward since [richard_webber] is a doctor, but he used to change [meredith_grey]'s diapers.
[richard_webber] then gives the penis box to the police, and [meredith_grey] leaves.
[the_johnson] baby is in surgery.
[preston_burke] explains the procedure to the team.
[preston_burke] starts to open the baby's chest and tells [meredith_grey] to scrub in because [preston_burke] will let her hold the clamp.
[meredith_grey] quickly goes to the scrub room.
[derek_shepherd] enters the rapist's room angrily and hits the bed to wake him.
[derek_shepherd] informs the rapist that [miranda_bailey] stopped his bleeding but his penis was given to the police, then [derek_shepherd] leaves.
The rapist notices the rapist is handcuffed to the bed.
[cristina_yang] and [alex_karev] deliver more test results.
[cristina_yang] tells a patient their tumor is benign, so the patient can go home.
The patient hugs the patient's husband, who then tries to hug [cristina_yang].
[cristina_yang] quickly pushes [alex_karev] in the way, so [alex_karev] receives the hug instead.
[cristina_yang] leaves, satisfied.
[preston_burke] operates on [the_johnson] baby while [meredith_grey] holds the clamp.
The interns watch the babies in the nursery.
[meredith_grey] tells [isobel_stevens] and [george_omalley] they can move in.
[isobel_stevens] and [george_omalley] get excited and hug each other.
[allison] starts waking up, and [derek_shepherd] welcomes [allison] back.
[meredith_grey] goes to an elevator where [derek_shepherd] is waiting.
[derek_shepherd] mentions [derek_shepherd] really likes ferry boats.
After looking at [derek_shepherd], [meredith_grey] decides to take the stairs.
[derek_shepherd] feels sorry for [meredith_grey]'s "lack of self-control."
[meredith_grey] leaves the hospital to join [george_omalley], [isobel_stevens], and [cristina_yang].
