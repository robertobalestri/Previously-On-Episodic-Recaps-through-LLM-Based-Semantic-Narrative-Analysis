[derek_shepherd] is surprised that [allison] survived after what happened to her. [preston_burke] observes that [allison] fought back.

[preston_burke] refers to [allison] as a warrior, but Meredith corrects [preston_burke], saying her name is [allison]. [preston_burke] discovers the cause of the injury but is unsure what it is. [preston_burke] asks the others in the room, and Meredith states it is the rapist's penis, causing the doctors to mumble in disgust.

[george_omalley] boasts to [cristina_yang] about being on the code team, but [cristina_yang] tells [george_omalley] to stop talking.

Meredith explains [ellis_grey] is just taking a break. Meredith tells [richard_webber] she was instructed to bring the "penis box" to him. [richard_webber] corrects Meredith, stating the police need it. [richard_webber] explains that until the police take custody, Meredith must keep it because all medical items must stay with the person who collected them. [cristina_yang] and Alex Karev give lab results to a family. [cristina_yang] and Alex inform the patient about a disorder called multinucleate cell angiohistiocytoma.

Meredith realizes the man is the rapist. Inside, Meredith calls for security and shows [miranda_bailey] the rapist. [miranda_bailey] tells Meredith to take the rapist to OR 1 and to inform [richard_webber] [richard_webber] about the situation. While the rapist is in surgery, [cristina_yang] and Meredith discuss [allison] and the rapist. [miranda_bailey] asks why they don't reattach the penis. Meredith explains they can't reattach it because it wasn't a clean cut, and [allison]'s digestive juices damaged it. Meredith mentions the rapist will have to use a bag to urinate for a long time. [cristina_yang] adds that the rapist will never be able to have sex again, which [cristina_yang] thinks is unfortunate. [miranda_bailey] sarcastically suggests they should take a moment to mourn, and then Meredith and [cristina_yang] return to their work. [richard_webber] [richard_webber] leaves an operating room and tells [preston_burke] they have the rapist. The conversation shifts when [preston_burke] asks why he can't be Chief.

[george_omalley] points out that at least [izzie_stevens] is helping people. Alex adds that [izzie_stevens] is practicing medicine. [izzie_stevens] starts to talk about Ms. Lu, but [cristina_yang] ignores [izzie_stevens]. Meredith Grey arrives and informs them that the police cannot take the penis, so Meredith must keep it overnight. They all express their frustrations about being interns. [miranda_bailey] enters with an eager expression, and the interns exit. Meredith sees the baby's parents, Mr. and [mrs_johnson], and expresses her worries about their child. The pediatric intern tells Meredith that Meredith overstepped by suggesting the heart murmur might not be harmless. The pediatric intern then gets [dr_kay], her resident. [dr_kay] asks what the issue is, and Mr. and [mrs_johnson] say they want treatment if their child is sick. [dr_kay] inquires who informed them of this, and the pediatric intern replies it was Meredith. When [dr_kay] asks if Meredith is allowed to be there, [preston_burke] confirms he authorized Meredith's presence. [preston_burke] questions the pediatric intern about her certainty regarding the murmur's benign nature. The pediatric intern states she is 75% sure.
[preston_burke] then mentions that the baby is now under [preston_burke]'s care and introduces himself to Mr. and [mrs_johnson].

As [ahn] and the accompanying person start to leave, Ms. Lu returns and thanks [izzie_stevens] in her language before leaving.
[preston_burke] asks [miranda_bailey] if [preston_burke] is too confident.
[miranda_bailey] replies no, but [preston_burke] feels [miranda_bailey] is not being honest.
[preston_burke] tells [miranda_bailey] that anything [miranda_bailey] says in the next thirty seconds is free.
[miranda_bailey] starts listing all the bad things about a person.
[preston_burke] tries to interrupt, but [miranda_bailey] insists she is not finished.
In the locker room, [cristina_yang] says she needs a drink, a man, and a massage.

[cristina_yang] then leaves.
Meredith Grey sits in a rocking chair in the nursery.
A pediatric intern expresses that the pediatric intern thought the pediatric intern was correct. Meredith Grey responds that interns are usually wrong. The pediatric intern then asks Meredith Grey if Meredith Grey feels scared. When Meredith Grey confirms that Meredith Grey does, the pediatric intern feels relieved that the pediatric intern is not alone in the fear. Meredith Grey asks [derek_shepherd] about [allison]'s condition. [derek_shepherd] replies that there has been no change. [derek_shepherd] shares that [derek_shepherd] has four sisters, and if [derek_shepherd] were in a coma, all four sisters would be there. [derek_shepherd] talks about [derek_shepherd]'s relationship, but the discussion shifts back to [allison], who feels alone. As they speak, [allison]'s condition worsens. [derek_shepherd] instructs the team to prepare the operating room for an emergency craniotomy. After the surgery, [derek_shepherd] updates Meredith Grey about [allison]. Meredith Grey asks if [allison] will survive, and [derek_shepherd] replies that [allison] will be fine if [allison] wakes up. [derek_shepherd] then asks [preston_burke] about the drink that [derek_shepherd] and [preston_burke] had discussed. [preston_burke] declines, stating that [derek_shepherd] is just competition for Chief of Surgery, and [preston_burke] walks away. Meredith Grey works on a paper about a penis box with [patricia_clarkson]'s help. [richard_webber] [richard_webber] tries to say "penis" but struggles. [richard_webber] [richard_webber] mentions that it shouldn't be awkward since [richard_webber] [richard_webber] is a doctor, but [richard_webber] [richard_webber] used to change Meredith Grey's diapers. [richard_webber] [richard_webber] then gives the penis box to the police, and Meredith Grey leaves.
Meanwhile, the Johnson baby is in surgery. [preston_burke] explains the procedure to the team. [preston_burke] starts to open the baby's chest and tells Meredith Grey to scrub in, as [preston_burke] will let Meredith Grey hold the clamp. Meredith Grey goes to the scrub room. [derek_shepherd] enters the rapist's room and hits the end of the bed, waking the man. [derek_shepherd] informs the rapist that [miranda_bailey] stopped the rapist's bleeding, but the police took the rapist's penis. [derek_shepherd] then leaves. The rapist realizes he is handcuffed to the bed. [cristina_yang] and Alex Karev provide more test results. [cristina_yang] tells a patient that the patient's tumor is benign, so the patient can go home. The patient hugs the patient's husband, who then approaches [cristina_yang]. [cristina_yang] quickly pushes Alex Karev in front of her. Alex Karev receives the hug, and [cristina_yang] leaves, feeling satisfied. [preston_burke] operates on the baby while Meredith Grey holds the clamp. The interns are watching the babies in the nursery. Meredith Grey tells [izzie_stevens] and [george_omalley] they can move in, and [izzie_stevens] and [george_omalley] get excited and hug each other. [allison] starts to wake up, and [derek_shepherd] greets [allison]. Meredith Grey goes to the elevator where [derek_shepherd] is waiting.
