Dr. Meredith Grey opens the episode with a narration about secrets and how they are exposed in the hospital. The episode begins with Meredith, Cristina Yang, and Izzie Stevens discussing Meredith’s ongoing sexual relationship with Derek Shepherd. Cristina presses Meredith for details about the relationship, while Meredith admits she hardly knows anything about Derek outside of their nightly encounters. Cristina jokes that she deserves more details, and Meredith retorts that Cristina already knows more than most. Cristina speculates about why Derek left New York for Seattle.

Meanwhile, George O'Malley is the subject of teasing from Cristina and Izzie, who encourage him to ask out a red-haired nurse, Olivia Harper. George is awkward but eventually interacts with Olivia, and they begin a relationship. Later, George is caught by Izzie in the bathroom, leading to an embarrassing misunderstanding about what he was doing in there. Izzie and Meredith tease him, but George insists he has a girlfriend.

Meredith receives a call from Miss Henry at her mother's nursing home, but she brushes it off, not wanting to discuss her mother’s condition. Izzie and George continue their banter about George’s supposed activities in the bathroom, with George insisting he has a real girlfriend.

Cristina is shown making a phone call, confirming an appointment for a procedure, hinting at a personal medical issue. Preston Burke tries to connect with Cristina, but she avoids giving him her home number and leaves abruptly.

At the hospital, George develops a rash and asks Cristina to examine it. Cristina bluntly tells him it’s on his penis and calls Alex Karev for a second opinion. Alex diagnoses George with syphilis. George is mortified, and the news quickly spreads among the interns. Alex jokes about George’s situation, and Cristina insists George must tell Olivia so she can get tested. George struggles with how to break the news to Olivia.

The interns are assigned to assist Dr. Burke with a patient, Bill, who is a friend of Burke’s from college. Bill is in the hospital for abdominal pain and blood in his urine. During the procedure, they discover a mass in his bladder. The team later learns, through chromosome analysis, that the mass is actually an ovary, and Bill is a chimera—he has DNA from two embryos that merged in the womb, resulting in both male and female reproductive organs. This revelation shocks Bill, who is concerned about what to tell his pregnant wife, Holly.

Meanwhile, George’s syphilis diagnosis becomes the talk of the hospital. Miranda Bailey addresses the staff about a syphilis outbreak, urging everyone to get tested and practice safe sex. Patricia gives a demonstration on condom use to the staff, further embarrassing George.

George finally tells Olivia about his diagnosis in a rambling, awkward conversation. Olivia reveals she already knows she has syphilis and admits she was seeing someone else before George, but broke it off when she realized she liked George more.

Elsewhere, the interns are tasked with performing a paracentesis on Mr. Franklin, a patient with severe abdominal swelling due to liver disease. They perform the procedure, but Mr. Franklin dies unexpectedly. The interns are devastated and question whether they made a mistake. Bailey reassures them that they followed protocol and that his death was likely due to underlying heart and liver disease. The family initially refuses an autopsy, but after discussion, the interns decide to perform an unauthorized autopsy to clear their names. During the autopsy, they discover Mr. Franklin had a genetic blood disorder, hematomacrosis, which caused his heart failure, not the procedure they performed. They inform the family, who are upset about the unauthorized autopsy but relieved to learn the truth and that the disease is treatable if caught early.

Burke confronts Bill’s wife, Molly, about the paternity of her unborn child, as Bill is sterile due to his condition. Molly insists that what Bill doesn’t know won’t hurt him and begs Burke not to tell him. Burke struggles with his loyalty as a friend versus his duty as a doctor but ultimately decides Bill deserves the truth.

Meredith continues to avoid her mother’s situation, but Miss Henry tells her that her mother, Ellis Grey, has been asking for her. Meredith confides in Cristina about her mother’s Alzheimer’s diagnosis and the burden of keeping it a secret.

Bailey discovers the interns performed an unauthorized autopsy and is furious, warning them of the legal and professional consequences. However, the results of the autopsy vindicate the interns, as they discover the true cause of death and potentially save a family member’s life by identifying the genetic disorder.

The episode concludes with Meredith reflecting on the relief and consequences of exposing secrets. George learns from Olivia that she had been seeing Alex Karev before him, and realizes that’s how he contracted syphilis. He confronts Alex in anger, causing a scene.

Cristina and Meredith share a moment, discussing the exhaustion of the day and the comfort of sharing secrets. Derek approaches Meredith to apologize, but before he can explain, Addison Shepherd arrives, introducing herself as Derek’s wife and confronting Meredith as the woman who has been sleeping with her husband. Meredith is left stunned as the episode ends with her narration about the loss of control over secrets once they are revealed.
