As they walk away, Derek's phone rings again, but he ignores it.
In the operating room, Burke performs surgery on Bill.
Dr. Knox informs Burke that she only needs to stitch the bladder wall.
She then reveals that even though Bill's wife is pregnant, Bill is sterile, so the baby cannot be his.

Izzie, Cristina, and Bailey meet with Alice and Rebecca Franklin.
Alice threatens to sue them.
