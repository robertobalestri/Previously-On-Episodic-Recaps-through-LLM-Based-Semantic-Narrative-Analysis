[george_omalley] sits naked on the edge of the bath, reading about rashes.
[isobel_stevens] knocks and tells [george_omalley] to hurry.
[isobel_stevens] asks what [george_omalley] is doing, but [george_omalley] says it's private.
[isobel_stevens] laughs and decides to wait.
In her room, [meredith_grey] talks quietly to a nurse at her mother's nursing home.
[meredith_grey] hangs up when [derek_shepherd] wakes up.
[george_omalley] leaves the bathroom, and [isobel_stevens] tells [george_omalley] not to be ashamed, thinking [george_omalley] was masturbating.
[meredith_grey] walks out, curious about their argument.
[isobel_stevens] explains she caught [george_omalley] in an embarrassing situation.
They all walk away.
[derek_shepherd]'s phone rings, but [derek_shepherd] ignores it.
[cristina_yang] talks to a doctor about her abortion scheduled for the 16th.
[cristina_yang] hangs up when [preston_burke] approaches.
[preston_burke] asks [cristina_yang] why she didn't answer his page last night.
[cristina_yang] thinks about telling [preston_burke] she's pregnant but decides not to.
[richard_webber] walks by, swaying and rubbing his head.
[george_omalley] quietly talks to [olivia] in a corner.
[richard_webber] passes and asks [olivia] if she feels okay.
[richard_webber] starts to tell [olivia] he feels itchy, but [isobel_stevens] interrupts.
[george_omalley] and [olivia] leave.
[isobel_stevens] realizes [george_omalley] wasn't playing with [jimmy] and the twins.
[isobel_stevens] looks confused, wondering what [george_omalley] was doing.
In the locker room, [george_omalley] talks to [alex_karev].
[george_omalley] asks [alex_karev] to inspect his rash because [george_omalley] can't see it well.
[alex_karev] kneels down, inspects [george_omalley]'s penis, and pats [george_omalley] on the shoulder.
[alex_karev] tells [george_omalley] it's syphilis and walks away.
[preston_burke], [alex_karev], and [george_omalley] treat a patient by inserting a camera.
[bill], a friend of [preston_burke]'s, is involved.
[preston_burke] tells them to focus only on the baby in the patient's uterus.
They finish and schedule a CT scan.
In another operating room, [meredith_grey] looks worriedly at [derek_shepherd] in the gallery.
[meredith_grey] helps [richard_webber] and [miranda_bailey].
[miranda_bailey] and [meredith_grey] are concerned as [richard_webber] complains about the lighting, but they continue the surgery.
[cristina_yang] and [isobel_stevens] examine a patient with a very large abdomen.
The patient says it has been growing for some time.
[george_omalley] asks for his own bloodwork.
[isobel_stevens] takes the bloodwork and questions why [george_omalley] has it if it's not surgical, and who has syphilis.
[george_omalley] pulls [isobel_stevens] into a room and closes the shades.
[isobel_stevens] jokes about [george_omalley] but reassures him that penicillin will cure it.
During surgery, [richard_webber] drops an instrument and blinks rapidly.
[richard_webber] steps back, letting [miranda_bailey] continue.
After seeing the CT results, [alex_karev] and [george_omalley] discuss [george_omalley]'s condition and then go to find [preston_burke].
[cristina_yang] and [isobel_stevens] inform [mr_franklin] that he has ascites.
[mr_franklin] and his wife are worried, but their daughter seems uninterested, blaming [mr_franklin]'s drinking.
[alex_karev] and [preston_burke] look at the results and debate what something resembles.
[alex_karev] jokes that it looks like an ovary.
[george_omalley] enters and gives [preston_burke] some results.
[preston_burke] is surprised to find out it's an ovary.
[cristina_yang] and [isobel_stevens] inform [miranda_bailey] about [mr_franklin].
After testing, [miranda_bailey] tells [cristina_yang] and [isobel_stevens] they can perform a paracentesis.
[cristina_yang] and [isobel_stevens] celebrate as [miranda_bailey] leaves.
[alex_karev] and [george_omalley] walk down the stairs.
[george_omalley] kisses [olivia], and [alex_karev] leaves when ignored.
During the kiss, [george_omalley] pulls back and [olivia] asks if he's breaking up with her.
[george_omalley] assures [olivia] he's not breaking up with her.
After struggling to explain, [george_omalley] finally tells [olivia] he has syphilis.
Shocked, [olivia] quickly walks away.
[derek_shepherd] goes to [richard_webber]'s office and asks about [richard_webber]'s behavior.
[richard_webber] explains that a few weeks ago, his vision in his right eye became blurry during surgery.
After a few hours, the issue returned.
[richard_webber] allowed [derek_shepherd] to run tests but wanted them kept secret.
[alex_karev] and [george_omalley] walked outside with their trays, passing [olivia]'s table.
[olivia] seemed to ignore [george_omalley].
[alex_karev] and [george_omalley] joined [cristina_yang], [isobel_stevens], and [meredith_grey].
[george_omalley] was surprised to learn they all knew about his syphilis.
[alex_karev] reassured [george_omalley] that women might now see him as a "player."
[preston_burke] went into [bill]'s room and explained the mass was an ovary, not a tumor.
[bill] was initially shocked, but [preston_burke] assured [bill] they could remove it and he would still be a man.
In another room, [george_omalley] was bent over a gurney.
[alex_karev] was about to give [george_omalley] penicillin.
[meredith_grey] criticized [alex_karev]'s method, so [alex_karev] gave [meredith_grey] the needle and left.
[isobel_stevens] and [cristina_yang] quickly followed.
After [meredith_grey] finished, [george_omalley] left angrily.
[meredith_grey] then quietly spoke to one of [ellis_grey]'s nurses.
[derek_shepherd] and [richard_webber] walk down a corridor.
[derek_shepherd] mentions he has an MRI scheduled.
As [derek_shepherd] leaves, [patricia] approaches [richard_webber] with a situation.
[richard_webber] faces many doctors and complains about three interns, four residents, and six nurses on the surgical floor having syphilis.
[olivia] and [george_omalley] exchange looks from across the room.
After a stern lecture, [richard_webber] instructs [patricia] to demonstrate safe sex using a condom and banana.
[derek_shepherd] quietly enters and asks [richard_webber] to come for the MRI.
[cristina_yang] waits in line when [preston_burke] notices her and asks why she is avoiding him.
[cristina_yang] claims she isn't and is just in the syphilis line.
[preston_burke] tells her she doesn't need to be there and asks if he should be.
[cristina_yang] says no, and they both leave in different directions.
[isobel_stevens] joins [cristina_yang], and they go to [mr_franklin]'s room.
In [mr_franklin]'s room, they give him an anesthetic and say they need to wait.
[derek_shepherd] and [richard_webber] look at [mr_franklin]'s MRI scans and find a tumor on his optic nerve.
[derek_shepherd] plans a secret surgery for that night.
[richard_webber] leaves as [meredith_grey] arrives, and [derek_shepherd] shares the secret with [meredith_grey].
In [mr_franklin]'s room, [isobel_stevens] and [cristina_yang] notice [mr_franklin] has a lot of fluids.
[isobel_stevens] checks [mr_franklin]'s pulse and finds none.
[cristina_yang] presses the code button while [isobel_stevens] starts CPR.
The code team arrives, but it's too late.
[cristina_yang] and [isobel_stevens] leave, with [isobel_stevens] worried they missed something.
[miranda_bailey] reassures [isobel_stevens] and [cristina_yang] they did everything possible.
[cristina_yang] asks [miranda_bailey] about an autopsy, but [miranda_bailey] says there won't be one because the family refused.
[cristina_yang] is frustrated, wanting to know the cause.
[derek_shepherd] approaches [miranda_bailey] and [meredith_grey] in the hall.
[miranda_bailey] asks [derek_shepherd] to inform [richard_webber] she will attend his surgery.
After [miranda_bailey] leaves, [meredith_grey] asks [derek_shepherd] if she should get tested.
[derek_shepherd] assures [meredith_grey] it's unnecessary, joking they are like a condom ad.
As [derek_shepherd] and [meredith_grey] walk away, [derek_shepherd]'s phone rings, but he ignores it.
In the operating room, [preston_burke] is performing surgery on [bill].
[dr_knox] informs [preston_burke] that she needs to sew up a hole in the bladder wall.
[dr_knox] then reveals that [bill]'s wife is pregnant, but [bill] is sterile, so the baby cannot be his.
[isobel_stevens] and [cristina_yang] talk to [mr_franklin]'s wife and daughter, trying to get permission for an autopsy.
[mr_franklin]'s wife thinks about it, but her daughter, [alice_franklin], refuses.
In a quiet hallway, [isobel_stevens] tells [cristina_yang] that they should do the autopsy because [mr_franklin]'s wife seemed to want it.
Despite [meredith_grey]'s warning, [cristina_yang] agrees with [isobel_stevens].
[meredith_grey] gives in and tells them [miranda_bailey] will be busy between 7 and 11, then leaves.
[derek_shepherd] enters his operating room and finds [richard_webber] and [miranda_bailey] preparing for his surgery.
In another room, [isobel_stevens] feels uneasy about taking [mr_franklin]'s body.
Meanwhile, [cristina_yang] opens a textbook and starts the autopsy.
[derek_shepherd], [miranda_bailey], and [meredith_grey] finish [richard_webber]'s surgery.
[miranda_bailey] tells [meredith_grey] it went well but warns that a mistake could cause blindness.
[miranda_bailey] asks [meredith_grey] to page [cristina_yang] and [isobel_stevens].
[meredith_grey] tries to cover for them, but [miranda_bailey] realizes she's lying.
[miranda_bailey] asks another doctor to finish and leaves to find them.
Outside [bill]'s room, [preston_burke] argues with [holly].
[holly] admits the baby isn't [bill]'s and she cheated, but insists they're happy.
[holly] asks [preston_burke] not to tell [bill] if he's a friend.
[preston_burke] agrees not to tell as a friend, but says he must as a doctor.
[meredith_grey] talks to [ms_henry], apologizing for not visiting.
[ms_henry] mentions [meredith_grey]'s mother remembered her and asked when she finished work.
[derek_shepherd] approaches, and [meredith_grey] ends the call quickly.
[meredith_grey] suddenly breaks down.
[meredith_grey] tells [derek_shepherd] that her mother isn't traveling or writing a book but has advanced Alzheimer's.
[derek_shepherd] kisses [meredith_grey] and smooths her hair.
[richard_webber] sees [derek_shepherd] and [meredith_grey] from his room and looks unhappy.
[miranda_bailey] confronts [cristina_yang] and [isobel_stevens] for ignoring the patient's family's wishes and technically committing assault.
[miranda_bailey] asks if [cristina_yang] and [isobel_stevens] have anything to say, and [isobel_stevens] shows [miranda_bailey] a large heart weighing 600 grams.
[miranda_bailey] reluctantly allows [cristina_yang] and [isobel_stevens] to run tests.
[meredith_grey] visits [richard_webber]'s room and is relieved he can still see.
[richard_webber] warns [meredith_grey] to stay away from [derek_shepherd], saying she's making a mistake, but [meredith_grey] insists she's not.
[isobel_stevens], [cristina_yang], and [miranda_bailey] meet with [alice_franklin] and [rebecca_franklin].
[alice_franklin] threatens to sue, but [cristina_yang] explains that [mr_franklin] died from a genetic disease called hemochromatosis, not from heavy drinking.
Concerned [alice_franklin] might have it, [cristina_yang], [isobel_stevens], and [miranda_bailey] request a blood test for [alice_franklin].
[isobel_stevens] agrees and discreetly hands [alice_franklin] the autopsy form to sign first.
[george_omalley] observes [preston_burke] talking to [bill].
[olivia] enters the locker room and tells [george_omalley] she was seeing [alex_karev] before they got together but ended it because she liked [george_omalley] more.
Upset, [george_omalley] punches [alex_karev], accusing [alex_karev] of giving him syphilis.
[meredith_grey] finds [derek_shepherd] in the lobby, and they discuss plans for the night.
[derek_shepherd] sees a red-haired woman and apologizes to [meredith_grey].
[addison_shepherd] approaches [derek_shepherd] and [meredith_grey] and asks [derek_shepherd] why he ignored her call. [addison_shepherd] introduces herself to [meredith_grey] and implies [meredith_grey] is involved with [addison_shepherd]'s husband.
