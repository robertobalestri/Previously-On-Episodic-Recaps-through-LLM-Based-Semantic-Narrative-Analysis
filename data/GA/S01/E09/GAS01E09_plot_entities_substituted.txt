[george_omalley] sits naked on the edge of the bath, reading a book about rashes. [izzie_stevens] knocks on the door and tells [george_omalley] to hurry. [izzie_stevens] asks what [george_omalley] is doing, but [george_omalley] says it is private. [izzie_stevens] laughs and says she will wait. In her room, [meredith_grey] speaks quietly with a nurse at [ellis_grey]'s nursing home. [meredith_grey] hangs up when [derek_shepherd] turns in his sleep and wakes up. [george_omalley] comes out of the bathroom, and [izzie_stevens] tells [george_omalley] there is no need to be ashamed, thinking [george_omalley] was masturbating. [meredith_grey] wonders why [izzie_stevens] and [george_omalley] are arguing. [izzie_stevens] explains that she caught [george_omalley] playing with [jimmy] and the twins. They all walk away, and [derek_shepherd] comes out with his ringing phone but ignores it. [cristina_yang] talks to a doctor about [cristina_yang]'s scheduled abortion on the 16th. [cristina_yang] hangs up when [preston_burke] appears around the corner. [preston_burke] asks [cristina_yang] why she didn't answer her page the night before. [cristina_yang] thinks about telling [preston_burke] about [cristina_yang]'s pregnancy but decides to walk away instead. The chief walks past [cristina_yang], swaying slightly and rubbing his head. [george_omalley] talks quietly to [olivia] in a corner as the chief passes by and asks [olivia] if she feels okay. [george_omalley] begins to mention that [george_omalley] feels itchy, but [izzie_stevens] interrupts [george_omalley]. [george_omalley] and [olivia] leave, and [izzie_stevens] realizes that [george_omalley] was not playing with [jimmy] and the twins.
[izzie_stevens] feels confused and wonders what [george_omalley] was doing.
In the locker room, [george_omalley] asks [alex_karev] to check [george_omalley]'s rash because [george_omalley] cannot see it clearly.
[alex_karev] kneels down, examines [george_omalley]'s penis, pats [george_omalley] on the shoulder, and tells [george_omalley] it is syphilis before walking away.
[preston_burke], [alex_karev], and [george_omalley] are treating a patient who has a camera inserted.
[bill], a friend of [preston_burke]'s, tells them to focus only on the baby in the patient's uterus.
They finish the procedure and schedule a CT scan.
In another operating room, [meredith_grey] looks up at [derek_shepherd] with concern while assisting the chief and [miranda_bailey].
[miranda_bailey] and [meredith_grey] also look worried as [richard_webber] complains about the lighting, but they continue with the surgery.
[cristina_yang] and [izzie_stevens] examine a patient with a large abdomen.
The patient mentions it has been growing for some time.
[george_omalley] requests the bloodwork for [george_omalley].
[izzie_stevens] takes the bloodwork from [george_omalley] and asks about syphilis.
[izzie_stevens] questions why [george_omalley] has the bloodwork if it isn't for surgery.
[george_omalley] pulls [izzie_stevens] into a room and closes the shades.
[izzie_stevens] teases [george_omalley] but reassures [george_omalley] that penicillin will cure it.
In surgery, the chief drops a tool and blinks quickly.
The chief steps back, letting [miranda_bailey] take over.
After reviewing the CT results and discussing [george_omalley]'s penis, [alex_karev] and [george_omalley] leave to find [preston_burke].
[cristina_yang] and [izzie_stevens] enter [mr_franklin]'s room and inform [mr_franklin] that he has ascites.
[mr_franklin] and [mr_franklin]'s wife appear worried, while [mr_franklin]'s daughter seems indifferent, attributing it to [mr_franklin]'s drinking.
Meanwhile, [alex_karev] and [preston_burke] look at the results and debate their appearance.
[alex_karev] jokes that one part resembles an ovary.
[george_omalley] enters and gives [preston_burke] some results.
[george_omalley] is shocked to find out that it is an ovary.
[cristina_yang] and [izzie_stevens] inform [miranda_bailey] about [mr_franklin].
After reviewing the tests, [miranda_bailey] tells [cristina_yang] and [izzie_stevens] that they can perform a paracentesis.
As [miranda_bailey] leaves, [cristina_yang] and [izzie_stevens] celebrate their success.
[alex_karev] and [george_omalley] walk down the stairs together.
[george_omalley] kisses [olivia].
After a moment of being ignored, [alex_karev] decides to leave.
During the kiss, [george_omalley] pulls away to talk to [olivia].
[olivia] anxiously asks [george_omalley] if he is breaking up with her.
[george_omalley] reassures [olivia] that he is not.
After a few awkward moments, [george_omalley] suddenly reveals that he has syphilis.
[olivia] is shocked and quickly walks away.
[derek_shepherd] enters the chief's office.
[derek_shepherd] asks the chief to explain the chief's recent behavior.
The chief shares that a few weeks ago, while operating, the chief's right eye became blurry.
After a few hours, the issue returned.
[derek_shepherd] ran some tests but kept the results secret.
[alex_karev] and [george_omalley] walked outside with their trays.
[alex_karev] and [george_omalley] passed [olivia]'s table, where [olivia] ignored [george_omalley].
[alex_karev] and [george_omalley] sat down with [cristina_yang], [izzie_stevens], and [meredith_grey].
[george_omalley] was shocked to learn that all three women knew about [george_omalley]'s syphilis.
[alex_karev] reassured [george_omalley] that the women would think [george_omalley] was a "player" now.
[preston_burke] entered [bill]'s room and explained that the mass was not a tumor but an ovary.
[bill] was initially shocked, but [preston_burke] assured [bill] that they could remove it without affecting [bill]'s identity as a man.
In another room, [george_omalley] bent over a gurney while [alex_karev] prepared to give [george_omalley] penicillin.
[meredith_grey] complained that [alex_karev] was doing it wrong.
[alex_karev] handed the needle to [meredith_grey] and left.
[izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] quickly followed [alex_karev].
After [meredith_grey] finished, [george_omalley] left angrily.
Meanwhile, [meredith_grey] spoke quietly with one of [ellis_grey]'s nurses.
[derek_shepherd] and the chief walked down a corridor.
[derek_shepherd] informs [richard_webber] about [derek_shepherd]'s scheduled MRI.
As [derek_shepherd] leaves, [patricia] arrives and tells [richard_webber] about a situation.
[richard_webber] sees many doctors in front of him.
[richard_webber] complains that three interns, four residents, and six nurses on the surgical floor have syphilis.
[olivia] and [george_omalley] exchange glances from opposite ends of the room.
After giving a stern lecture, [richard_webber] asks [patricia] to demonstrate safe sex using a condom and a banana.
[derek_shepherd] quietly enters the room and asks [richard_webber] to come for the MRI.
[cristina_yang] is in line when [dr_preston_burke] notices [cristina_yang] and asks why [cristina_yang] is avoiding him.
[cristina_yang] replies that [cristina_yang] is not avoiding [dr_preston_burke]; [cristina_yang] is just waiting in the syphilis line.
[dr_preston_burke] tells [cristina_yang] that [cristina_yang] doesn't need to be there and asks if he should be.
[cristina_yang] says no, and both [cristina_yang] and [dr_preston_burke] leave the line, going in opposite directions.
[izzie_stevens] joins [cristina_yang], and [izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] head to [mr_franklin]'s room.
In [mr_franklin]'s room, medical staff inject [mr_franklin] with anesthetic and tell everyone to wait.
[derek_shepherd] and [richard_webber] look at [mr_franklin]'s MRI scans and find a tumor on [mr_franklin]'s optic nerve.
[derek_shepherd] plans a secret surgery for that night.
[richard_webber] leaves as [meredith_grey] arrives, and [derek_shepherd] shares the secret with [meredith_grey].
In [mr_franklin]'s room, [izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] notice [mr_franklin] has a lot of fluids.
[izzie_stevens] checks [mr_franklin]'s pulse and finds none.
[cristina_yang] presses the code button while [izzie_stevens] begins CPR.
The code team arrives shortly after, but it is too late to save [mr_franklin].
[izzie_stevens] feels scared and thinks [izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] missed something.
[miranda_bailey] reassures [izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] that they did everything they could.
[cristina_yang] asks [miranda_bailey] about the autopsy, but [miranda_bailey] informs [cristina_yang] that [mr_franklin]'s family declined one.
[cristina_yang] feels frustrated and says [cristina_yang] wanted to know the cause of death.
[dr_derek_shepherd] approaches [miranda_bailey] and [meredith_grey] in the hallway.
[miranda_bailey] asks [derek_shepherd] to inform [richard_webber] that [miranda_bailey] will attend the surgery.
After [miranda_bailey] leaves, [meredith_grey] asks [derek_shepherd] if [meredith_grey] should get tested since they never established any rules.
[derek_shepherd] tells [meredith_grey] she doesn't need to and jokes that they are practically a condom advertisement.
As they walk away, [derek_shepherd]'s phone rings again, but [derek_shepherd] ignores it.
In the operating room, [dr_preston_burke] performs surgery on [bill].
[dr_knox] informs [dr_preston_burke] that she only needs to stitch the bladder wall.
[dr_knox] then reveals that even though [bill]'s wife is pregnant, [bill] is sterile, so the baby cannot be his.
[izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] meet with [mr_franklin]'s wife and daughter to ask for permission for an autopsy.
[mr_franklin]'s wife thinks about it, but [mr_franklin]'s daughter, [alice_franklin], refuses.
In a quiet hallway, [izzie_stevens] tells [cristina_yang] that they should proceed with the autopsy since [mr_franklin]'s wife clearly wanted it.
[cristina_yang] agrees, despite [meredith_grey]'s earlier warning.
[meredith_grey] decides to let [izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] go ahead but mentions that [miranda_bailey] will be busy from 7 to 11 and then leaves. [dr_derek_shepherd] enters his operating room and sees [richard_webber] and [miranda_bailey] preparing for his surgery. Meanwhile, in another room, [izzie_stevens] feels uneasy about taking [mr_franklin]'s body while [cristina_yang] holds open a textbook and starts the procedure. [derek_shepherd], [miranda_bailey], and [meredith_grey] finish [richard_webber]'s surgery. [miranda_bailey] informs [meredith_grey] that it went well but warns that a mistake could leave [richard_webber] blind forever. [miranda_bailey] asks [meredith_grey] to page [cristina_yang] and [izzie_stevens]. When [meredith_grey] tries to cover for [cristina_yang] and [izzie_stevens], [miranda_bailey] realizes [meredith_grey] is not telling the truth. [miranda_bailey] asks another doctor to finish up and leaves to find [cristina_yang] and [izzie_stevens]. Outside [bill]'s room, [dr_preston_burke] argues with [holly]. [holly] admits that the baby is not [dr_preston_burke]'s and that she cheated on [dr_preston_burke], but they are happy. [holly] asks [dr_preston_burke] not to tell [bill] since [bill] is [dr_preston_burke]'s friend. [dr_preston_burke] replies that as a friend, he won't tell [bill], but as a doctor, he has to. [meredith_grey] speaks with [ms_henry] and apologizes for not visiting. [ms_henry] mentions that [ms_henry]'s mother remembered [ms_henry] that day and asked when [ms_henry] would finish work. [derek_shepherd] approaches, and [meredith_grey] quickly hangs up. Suddenly, [meredith_grey] breaks down. [meredith_grey] tells [derek_shepherd] that [ellis_grey] is not traveling or writing a book; [ellis_grey] has very advanced Alzheimer's. [derek_shepherd] comforts [meredith_grey] with a kiss and smooths [meredith_grey]'s hair.
[richard_webber], watching from his room, looks unhappy. [miranda_bailey] enters the room where [cristina_yang] and [izzie_stevens] are. [miranda_bailey] tells [cristina_yang] and [izzie_stevens] that they ignored [mr_franklin]'s family's wishes and were committing assault. [miranda_bailey] asks if [cristina_yang] and [izzie_stevens] have anything to say. [izzie_stevens] shows [miranda_bailey] a large heart that weighs 600 grams. [miranda_bailey] reluctantly allows [cristina_yang] and [izzie_stevens] to run some tests. [meredith_grey] goes into [richard_webber]'s office. [meredith_grey] is happy to see that [richard_webber] can still see. [richard_webber] warns [meredith_grey] to stay away from [dr_derek_shepherd] and says that [meredith_grey] is making a mistake. [meredith_grey] insists that she is not. [izzie_stevens], [cristina_yang], and [miranda_bailey] meet with [alice_franklin] and [rebecca_franklin]. [alice_franklin] threatens to sue them. [cristina_yang] interrupts and explains that [mr_franklin] died from a genetic disease called hemochromatosis, not from heavy drinking. [izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] worry that [alice_franklin] might have the disease and ask for a blood test. [izzie_stevens] agrees but slyly asks [alice_franklin] to sign the autopsy form first. [george_omalley] sees [dr_preston_burke] talking to [bill]. [olivia] enters the locker room and tells [george_omalley] that she dated [alex_karev] before [alex_karev] and [george_omalley] got together. [olivia] broke it off because she liked [george_omalley] more.
Upset, [george_omalley] turns and punches [alex_karev], yelling that [alex_karev] gave him syphilis.
[meredith_grey] walks into the lobby where [dr_derek_shepherd] is waiting.
[meredith_grey] and [dr_derek_shepherd] discuss their plans for the night.
[dr_derek_shepherd] turns to see a woman with red hair.
[dr_derek_shepherd] says sorry to [meredith_grey] as [addison_shepherd] approaches them.
[addison_shepherd] asks [dr_derek_shepherd] why [dr_derek_shepherd] did not answer her call.
Then, [addison_shepherd] introduces herself to [meredith_grey].
[addison_shepherd] says her name is [addison_shepherd] and implies that [meredith_grey] is the woman involved with [addison_shepherd]'s husband.
