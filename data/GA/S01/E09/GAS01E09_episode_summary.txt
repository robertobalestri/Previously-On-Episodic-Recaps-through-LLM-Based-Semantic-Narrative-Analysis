The episode began with Meredith Grey reflecting on the nature of secrets and how the practice of medicine often brings hidden truths to light. Cristina Yang questioned Meredith about her relationship with Derek Shepherd, pressing for intimate details, while Izzie Stevens speculated that Meredith and Derek's connection went beyond casual sex. Derek admitted to Meredith that he barely knew her, and Meredith confessed that their relationship consisted mostly of nightly encounters. Cristina remained curious, and Izzie wondered aloud why Derek had left New York for Seattle. Derek, meanwhile, thanked Meredith for bringing him coffee.

Cristina then asked Dr. Miranda Bailey about the challenges of adoption and keeping a baby, but insisted she was not personally interested. George O'Malley, feeling emasculated by his friends, protested being treated like a sister. Alex Karev teased George about his lack of a sex life, and Cristina encouraged George to pursue a red-haired nurse. The nurse, Olivia Harper, responded flirtatiously to George's awkward attempt at conversation. When Meredith asked about Olivia, Richard Webber jokingly identified her as “Dad.” Meredith then inquired about a patient's diagnosis, and Webber revealed it was Alzheimer's disease, noting that Meredith was the only person allowed to visit the patient.

At home, Meredith found George locked in the bathroom. She needed to shower, but George insisted he would be out soon and claimed his activities were private. Meredith apologized for interrupting, and George insisted he was not doing what she thought. After George emerged, Meredith mused that people are rarely prepared when secrets are revealed.

Later that night, Miss Henry from the nursing home called Meredith about her mother. Meredith, startled, asked if her mother was all right, but Miss Henry said it was not urgent and hung up. When Izzie asked about the late call, Meredith lied and said it was a wrong number. Izzie then tried to reassure George about being caught in the bathroom, joking about his “imaginary girlfriend,” while George insisted his girlfriend was real. Meredith entered and asked what was happening, but George and Izzie brushed her off. Izzie teased George about being caught “playing with little Jimmy and the twins,” but George continued to protest his innocence.

At the hospital, Meredith refused to attend a counseling session, claiming she had already made her decision. Izzie told George she had paged him the previous night, but George was not on call. George mentioned Preston Burke, who quickly excused himself. Meredith continued to narrate about the burden of secrets.

George later approached Olivia Harper to say he had enjoyed their recent time together. Olivia reciprocated, but when George asked if she felt all right, she said she was fine. George admitted to feeling “a little itchy.” Izzie called George away, and Olivia greeted Izzie before leaving. Cristina and Izzie teased George about Olivia's interest in him. Meredith asked George if he really had not been doing anything in the bathroom, but George demanded an apology and left. George then asked Cristina to examine a rash, fearing it was syphilis. Cristina confirmed his suspicion.

Meanwhile, Meredith presented a patient with abdominal pain and blood in his urine. The initial tests were inconclusive, so a cystoscopy was ordered. Derek thanked Burke for his help, and the two reminisced about their fraternity days. Bailey warned them to be careful with their answers. During the procedure, Bailey joked with the patient, Bill, about the camera being inserted. They discovered a mass and took a biopsy. Burke determined that most of Bill's colon would need to be removed due to extensive damage.

George examined another patient, Mr. Franklin, who had abdominal swelling. Mrs. Franklin complained about the cost of tests, but George noted signs of liver disease and admitted Mr. Franklin for further evaluation. In the lab, George received his syphilis test results and was shocked to see they were positive. Alex asked who had syphilis, and George insisted it was not a surgical issue. Alex joked about Olivia's reputation, but George defended her. Cristina remarked that only the Amish were not promiscuous. Alex assured George that penicillin would cure him, but George worried about telling Olivia. Cristina insisted he had to tell her so she could get tested.

Bailey and the surgical team teased George about his syphilis diagnosis, joking about who had given him “cooties.” George refused to discuss his private life with the others. Meredith informed Mr. Franklin that he had ascites due to liver disease, and the family discussed his drinking habits. Alex and Izzie scheduled a paracentesis to relieve the pressure, and the attending surgeon instructed George and Izzie to perform the procedure themselves.

Lab results revealed that Bill's mass was actually an ovary, a result of chimerism. Bailey explained that Bill's body contained DNA from two embryos, resulting in gonadal hermaphroditism. Bill was shocked, but Burke and Alex reassured him. The team continued to joke about George's syphilis and Alex's reputation as a “player.”

Olivia invited George over after her shift, but George struggled to tell her about the syphilis. After stumbling over his words, he finally confessed. Meanwhile, Burke confided in Meredith about his vision problems and asked her to keep it secret, which Meredith agreed to do.

Patricia announced a syphilis outbreak among the hospital staff and demonstrated safe sex practices using a banana. Cristina and Burke discussed keeping the chief's surgery a secret, while Cristina and Meredith joked about relationship rules and syphilis testing.

During Mr. Franklin's paracentesis, he died unexpectedly. Burke and Dr. Knox reviewed the procedure and determined it had been performed correctly, but the family refused an autopsy. Cristina, Izzie, and Meredith decided to perform an unauthorized autopsy to clear themselves of blame. They snuck into the morgue at night, brought a textbook, and conducted the procedure. Bailey grew suspicious of their whereabouts.

Burke confronted Molly, Bill's wife, about her pregnancy, revealing that Bill was sterile and the baby could not be his. Molly refused to tell Bill the truth, but Burke insisted that Bill deserved to know. Meredith missed a family dinner for her mother due to surgery, and Miss Henry informed her that her mother had asked for her.

Meredith confided in Derek about her mother's Alzheimer's disease and admitted she had been lying to everyone about it. Bailey discovered the unauthorized autopsy and was furious, warning the interns of possible legal consequences. During the autopsy, they found that Mr. Franklin's heart was enlarged and filled with grainy material. Burke explained to the family that Mr. Franklin had died of hematomacrosis, a genetic blood disorder, not from complications of the procedure. The family realized the disease could affect their daughter Alice, and Burke recommended a blood test.

Olivia told George that she had been seeing Alex when she started dating George but broke it off when she realized she liked George more. George was upset to learn he had contracted syphilis from Olivia via Alex. A confrontation erupted between George and Alex, with Cristina, Izzie, and Meredith stepping in to break it up.

After a long day, Meredith and Cristina relaxed together, joking about drinking wine and making rules. Izzie apologized to Meredith, and Meredith reflected that once secrets are exposed, they no longer need to be hidden.

The episode concluded with the arrival of Dr. Addison Shepherd, who introduced herself to Meredith as Derek's wife, revealing that Meredith had been unknowingly involved with a married man and leaving her stunned.
