Dr. Meredith Grey began the day reflecting on the nature of secrets and how they inevitably come to light within the hospital. Early in the morning, Meredith, Cristina Yang, and Izzie Stevens gathered to discuss Meredith's ongoing sexual relationship with Derek Shepherd. Cristina pressed Meredith for more details, but Meredith admitted she knew little about Derek beyond their nightly encounters. Cristina joked that she deserved more information, and Meredith retorted that Cristina already knew more than most. Cristina speculated about Derek's reasons for leaving New York and moving to Seattle.

Meanwhile, George O'Malley became the target of teasing from Cristina and Izzie, who encouraged him to ask out a red-haired nurse named Olivia Harper. Despite his awkwardness, George managed to interact with Olivia, and the two began a relationship. Later, Izzie caught George in the bathroom, leading to an embarrassing misunderstanding about his activities. Izzie and Meredith teased him, but George insisted he had a real girlfriend.

Meredith received a call from Miss Henry at her mother's nursing home, but she dismissed it, unwilling to discuss her mother's condition. Izzie and George continued their banter about George's supposed bathroom activities, with George adamant about his relationship with Olivia.

Cristina was seen making a phone call to confirm an appointment for a medical procedure, hinting at a personal health issue. Preston Burke tried to connect with Cristina, but she avoided giving him her home number and left abruptly.

At the hospital, George developed a rash and nervously asked Cristina to examine it. Cristina bluntly informed him that the rash was on his penis and called Alex Karev for a second opinion. Alex diagnosed George with syphilis. Mortified, George became the subject of gossip among the interns. Alex joked about George's predicament, and Cristina insisted that George needed to tell Olivia so she could get tested. George struggled with how to break the news to her.

The interns were assigned to assist Dr. Burke with a patient named Bill, a friend of Burke's from college. Bill was admitted for abdominal pain and blood in his urine. During a procedure, the team discovered a mass in Bill's bladder. Chromosome analysis later revealed that the mass was actually an ovary, and Bill was a chimera, possessing DNA from two embryos that had merged in the womb, resulting in both male and female reproductive organs. Bill was shocked by the revelation and worried about what to tell his pregnant wife, Holly.

As George's syphilis diagnosis became the talk of the hospital, Miranda Bailey addressed the staff about a syphilis outbreak, urging everyone to get tested and practice safe sex. Patricia gave a condom demonstration to the staff, further embarrassing George.

George finally told Olivia about his diagnosis in a rambling, awkward conversation. Olivia revealed that she already knew she had syphilis and admitted she had been seeing someone else before George, but ended that relationship when she realized she liked George more.

Elsewhere, the interns were tasked with performing a paracentesis on Mr. Franklin, a patient suffering from severe abdominal swelling due to liver disease. They performed the procedure, but Mr. Franklin died unexpectedly. The interns were devastated and questioned whether they had made a mistake. Bailey reassured them that they had followed protocol and that Mr. Franklin's death was likely due to his underlying heart and liver disease. The family initially refused an autopsy, but after discussion, the interns decided to perform an unauthorized autopsy to clear their names. During the autopsy, they discovered that Mr. Franklin had a genetic blood disorder, hematomacrosis, which had caused his heart failure, not the procedure they performed. They informed the family, who were upset about the unauthorized autopsy but relieved to learn the truth and that the disease was treatable if caught early.

Burke confronted Bill's wife, Molly, about the paternity of her unborn child, since Bill was sterile due to his condition. Molly insisted that what Bill didn't know wouldn't hurt him and begged Burke not to tell him. Burke struggled with his loyalty as a friend versus his duty as a doctor but ultimately decided that Bill deserved to know the truth.

Meredith continued to avoid her mother's situation, but Miss Henry informed her that her mother, Ellis Grey, had been asking for her. Meredith confided in Cristina about her mother's Alzheimer's diagnosis and the burden of keeping it a secret.

Bailey discovered that the interns had performed an unauthorized autopsy and was furious, warning them of the legal and professional consequences. However, the results of the autopsy vindicated the interns, as they discovered the true cause of death and potentially saved a family member's life by identifying the genetic disorder.

As the day ended, Meredith reflected on the relief and consequences of exposing secrets. George learned from Olivia that she had been seeing Alex Karev before him and realized that was how he contracted syphilis. He confronted Alex in anger, causing a scene in the hospital.

Cristina and Meredith shared a quiet moment, discussing the exhaustion of the day and the comfort found in sharing secrets. Derek approached Meredith to apologize, but before he could explain, Addison Shepherd arrived, introducing herself as Derek's wife and confronting Meredith as the woman who had been sleeping with her husband. Meredith was left stunned as she realized the full consequences of secrets coming to light.
