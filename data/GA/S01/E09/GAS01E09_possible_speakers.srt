147
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:01,665
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I know this is a little out of your field.

148
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:02,826
Dr. Preston Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): That's not a problem.

149
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,550
Dr. Preston Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): It gives my interns something to do.

150
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,992
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I have a feeling you keep them plenty busy.

151
00:07:07,432 --> 00:07:08,874
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): We're in the same frat at Tulane.

152
00:07:09,574 --> 00:07:12,576
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): It's gone from torturing pledges to torturing interns.

153
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,057
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Am I right?

154
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:15,560
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Be very careful how you two answer that.

155
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:18,749
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I could tell some stories.

156
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:21,312
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Bill, you have a camera snaking up your mojo.

157
00:07:21,332 --> 00:07:22,595
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): It's not the time to cross me.

158
00:07:22,615 --> 00:07:24,036
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): It isn't anything too serious.

159
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:26,199

160
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:30,144
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You don't worry about anything but growing my godson in there.

161
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:31,747

164
00:07:36,954 --> 00:07:37,516

165
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:38,838

166
00:07:39,677 --> 00:07:40,139

167
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:40,939

168
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,812

169

172
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:58,709
Dr. Preston Burke / Bill (PVM): That's too much damage.

173
00:08:01,252 --> 00:08:04,396
Dr. Preston Burke / Bill (PVM): We'll have to remove most of the colon instead of a local resection.

174
00:08:23,884 --> 00:08:24,605
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): More suture.

175

George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley OR Olivia Harper (PVM): Mr. Franklin, how long has your abdomen been like this?

177
00:08:39,205 --> 00:08:40,706

183
00:08:50,368 --> 00:08:51,048
Mrs. Franklin / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Mr. Franklin (PVM): What's all that mean?

184
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:54,351
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): It means we have to admit your father and run some tests.

185
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:54,974
Mrs. Franklin / Mr. Franklin (PVM): Great.

186
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:57,034
Mrs. Franklin / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Mr. Franklin OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): What's that going to cost us this time?

187
00:08:57,677 --> 00:08:58,697
Mr. Franklin / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Alice, don't.

188
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:06,826

189
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:10,711

190
00:09:10,731 --> 00:09:11,452

194
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:25,066

195
00:09:25,186 --> 00:09:25,947

196
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:28,912
Alex Karev / Miss Henry (PVM): Hey, did you get something good?

197
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:29,734
George O'Malley / Miss Henry (PVM): Syphilis?

198
00:09:29,812 --> 00:09:30,413
George O'Malley / Miss Henry (PVM): It's not surgical.

199
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:31,096

00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:35,582

204
00:09:50,004 --> 00:09:50,706

205
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:52,951
Alex Karev / Miss Henry OR Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): God, Olivia must really be getting around.

206
00:09:52,971 --> 00:09:53,893
Dr. George O'Malley: Olivia, she's not like that.

207
00:09:54,514 --> 00:09:55,658
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): It's a new millennium, George.

208
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:58,683
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): The only people who aren't like that are the Amish, and apparently you.

209
00:09:59,384 --> 00:09:59,868
Dr. George O'Malley: You don't know.

210
00:09:59,908 --> 00:10:02,173
Dr. George O'Malley: Maybe I've been sleeping around.

211
00:10:02,692 --> 00:10:03,755
Dr. George O'Malley: Maybe I got ladies.

212
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:06,403

213

Alex Karev / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): It's no biggie.

215
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:10,875
Alex Karev / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Couple doses of penicillin will knock it right out.

216
00:10:10,897 --> 00:10:12,119
Dr. George O'Malley: What am I gonna do about Olivia?

217
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:13,879
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Well, for starters, stop sleeping with her.

218
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,605
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Unless you want that thing to fall off.

219
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,605
Dr. George O'Malley: Okay, that is twice.

220
00:10:17,904 --> 00:10:22,851
Dr. George O'Malley: That you've trash-talked the girl that I could one day potentially, well, not love, but like a whole lot.

221
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:26,138
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): If she gave it to you, you have to tell her.

222
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:27,259
Dr. George O'Malley: Fine.

223
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,399
Dr. George O'Malley: Fine.

224
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:29,461
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): She didn't give it to you.

225
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,124
Dr. George O'Malley: She was a virgin when you met.

226
00:10:32,326 --> 00:10:33,888
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You still have to tell her so she can get tested.

227
00:10:34,187 --> 00:10:34,788
Dr. George O'Malley: Oh, yeah?

228
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,812
Dr. George O'Malley: How am I gonna tell her?

229
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,807
Dr. George O'Malley: Uh, hey, Olivia, how you doing?

230
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:41,649
Dr. George O'Malley: By the way, I got the CIF.

231
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:42,350
Dr. George O'Malley: How about you?

232
00:10:42,551 --> 00:10:43,572
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Well, maybe not quite like that.

233
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:44,451
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): No, it's good advice.

234
00:10:44,493 --> 00:10:45,254
Dr. Bailey / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Really good advice.

235
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:46,033
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Thank you very much.

236
00:10:46,956 --> 00:10:47,657
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Bill (PVM): Retract here.

237
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:50,080
Surgical Nurse / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Here.

238
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,601
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Bill (PVM): Oh, this just isn't holding.

239
00:10:52,623 --> 00:10:56,225
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. Meredith Gray OR Bill (PVM): Give me a bigger retractor, please.

240
00:10:56,245 --> 00:10:57,028
Surgical Nurse / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Sorry, Doctor.

241
00:10:57,048 --> 00:10:57,567
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): It wasn't you.

242
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,614
Richard Webber / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Dr. Bailey, you can finish this.

243
00:11:04,178 --> 00:11:05,740
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Thank you, Chief.

244
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,942
Dr. Miranda Bailey: I appreciate the opportunity.

245
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:25,508
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I gotta say, George, I didn't think you had it in you.

246
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:26,528
Dr. Bailey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): It's always the quiet ones.

247
00:11:27,471 --> 00:11:28,211
Dr. Bailey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): So who's the woman?

248
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,932
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): None of your business.

249
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:29,994
Dr. Bailey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Oh, come on.

250
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,297
Dr. Bailey / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Who gave you the cooties on the playground?

251
00:11:32,868 --> 00:11:35,072
Dr. Bailey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You must have had something like this before, right?

252
00:11:35,552 --> 00:11:37,417
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I never talk about my penis with other men.

253
00:11:40,802 --> 00:11:42,706
Richard Webber / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I don't know, either, normally.

254
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:48,635
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): We better get Burke.

255
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,412
Meredith Grey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Mr. Franklin?

256
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,639
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You have a condition known as ascites.

257
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,440
Alice Franklin / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Oh, my god.

258
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,519
Mr. Franklin / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I knew it was terrible.

259
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:07,065
Meredith Grey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Just means there's fluid in the peritoneal cavity, the abdomen.

260
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:10,648
Meredith Grey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): And the swelling is pressing against your lungs, which is why you're having trouble breathing.

261
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:12,908
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): In your case, it looks like a symptom of liver disease.

262
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:15,432
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): And it all comes together.

263
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:16,952
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Alice, not now.

264
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:19,195
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Is there something we should know?

265
00:12:19,235 --> 00:12:23,980
Mr. Franklin / Bill OR Mr. Franklin (PVM): I drink a bit.

266
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,041
Unknown / Mr. Franklin (PVM): That's the understatement of the year.

267
00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:28,101
Unknown / Mr. Franklin (PVM): That's enough out of you.

268
00:12:28,302 --> 00:12:36,413
Alice / Dr. George O'Malley OR Mr. Franklin (PVM): Hey, I'm only here for mom, to make sure you don't pull any of your usual crap.

269
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:38,798
Doctor (likely Alex Karev) / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): There's definitely a growth protruding into the bladder.

270
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:39,960
Unknown / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): But look at the edges.

271
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,062
Unknown / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I don't think it's a tumor.

272
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:42,682
Unknown / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Kind of shaped like an ovary.

273
00:12:43,183 --> 00:12:45,388
Attending Physician (likely Dr. Bailey) / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): That the flip answer you're going to give your patient, Dr. Karev?

274
00:12:46,428 --> 00:12:47,610
Alex Karev / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): This is one of my oldest friends.

275
00:12:47,652 --> 00:12:49,033
Attending Physician (likely Dr. Bailey) / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You might want to take this seriously.

276
00:12:49,413 --> 00:12:50,096
Alex Karev / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I'm sorry, sir.

277
00:12:50,456 --> 00:12:50,937
Attending Physician (likely Dr. Bailey) / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You better be.

278
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,302
Lab Technician / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I got the rest of the labs back.

279
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:56,706

280
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,451
Lab Technician / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You won't believe this.

281
00:13:04,716 --> 00:13:06,960
Alex Karev / Bill (PVM): Bill has an ovary?

282
00:13:14,865 --> 00:13:17,970
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Miss Henry OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): According to his daughter, Mr. Franklin is a heavy drinker.

283
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,171
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Six to eight drinks a day.

284
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,552
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): An alcoholic by any standard.

285
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:21,293

287
00:13:22,774 --> 00:13:23,134
Alex Karev / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Reason?

288
00:13:23,575 --> 00:13:25,437
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Draining the fluid will relieve the pressure from the lungs.

289
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:25,557
Attending Physician (likely Dr. Bailey) / Mr. Franklin OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Good.

290
00:13:26,017 --> 00:13:26,998

291
00:13:27,018 --> 00:13:27,739
Attending Surgeon / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Do it.

292
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,701
George / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You want us to do the procedure?

293
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:30,844

294
00:13:31,024 --> 00:13:31,543

295
00:13:31,764 --> 00:13:34,567
Attending Surgeon / Mr. Franklin OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Well, now do one.

296
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:36,552

297
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:38,114

298
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,258
George / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Oh, my god.

299
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,879
Izzie / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): God, an ovary.

300
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:45,062
Alex / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Kind of gives new meaning to the term metrosexual.

301
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:47,547
Izzie / Olivia Harper (PVM): Hi, George.

302
00:13:48,168 --> 00:13:48,528
George / Olivia Harper OR Olivia Harper (PVM): Olivia.

303
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:49,889
Alex / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): What am I, invisible?

304
00:13:50,812 --> 00:13:51,091
George / Olivia Harper (PVM): Alex.

305
00:13:52,312 --> 00:13:52,653
Izzie / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You go ahead.

306
00:13:52,673 --> 00:13:53,676

307
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:09,408

308
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:10,753
George / Olivia Harper OR Olivia Harper (PVM): Olivia.

309
00:14:10,793 --> 00:14:12,173

00:14:12,195 --> 00:14:12,615
George / Olivia Harper OR Olivia Harper (PVM): Olivia.

311
00:14:12,716 --> 00:14:15,442
Olivia / Olivia Harper OR Bill OR Olivia Harper (PVM): Because mine's over at 8, and I thought maybe you could come over.

312
00:14:15,461 --> 00:14:17,125
George / Olivia Harper OR Bill OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Olivia, I need to tell you something.

313
00:14:17,144 --> 00:14:17,644

314
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,711

315
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:21,452

316
00:14:21,474 --> 00:14:21,673
George / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): No.

317
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:23,378

318
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:24,860
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): No, it's just.

319
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:31,451
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Okay, you're the only person that I've been with in a long time.

320
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:34,720
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I mean, not unusually long or anything.

321
00:14:35,302 --> 00:14:37,147
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Just a normal amount of a long time.

322
00:14:37,548 --> 00:14:41,278
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): But it wouldn't matter to me if you've been with someone else.

323
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,139
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Maybe you have.

324
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:48,341
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I'm not accusing you of anything or judging you or handing out scarlet letters or anything.

325
00:14:48,844 --> 00:14:50,807
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You're a woman.

326
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,629

327
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:55,673
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Of course, you've been with other men.

328
00:14:55,735 --> 00:14:57,836
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Not that you've been with a lot of men.

329
00:14:57,918 --> 00:14:59,581
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): It's not like you're a prostitute.

330
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:00,322
Olivia Harper / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Prostitute?

333
00:15:05,908 --> 00:15:07,032

334
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,336
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You're very ladylike.

335
00:15:09,397 --> 00:15:13,484
Olivia Harper / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I mean, you're very bendy, but... George, breathe.

336
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:13,605
George O'Malley / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Okay.

337
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:17,471
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): It's just, okay, here's the... I really like you, Olivia.

338
00:15:18,854 --> 00:15:19,634
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I like you a lot.

339
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:21,879
Olivia Harper / Olivia Harper (PVM): Well, I like you too.

340
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:28,091
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I have syphilis.

341
00:16:02,985 --> 00:16:03,947
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You dropped a retractor.

342
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:05,849
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Fine.

343
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:12,316
Dr. Burke / Bill (PVM): A few weeks ago, I was operating, and a vision in my right eye became blurry.

344
00:16:12,336 --> 00:16:14,076
Dr. Burke / Bill (PVM): After a few hours, it was fine.

345
00:16:14,096 --> 00:16:14,836
Dr. Burke / Bill (PVM): It's come back again.

346
00:16:15,077 --> 00:16:15,937
Meredith Grey / Mr. Franklin (PVM): Did you have it checked out?

347
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,721
Dr. Webber / Mr. Franklin (PVM): Examination was normal.

348
00:16:18,162 --> 00:16:20,322
Dr. Webber / Mr. Franklin (PVM): My ophthalmologist tells me I'm just getting older.

349
00:16:21,683 --> 00:16:24,128
Dr. Webber / Mr. Franklin (PVM): But do you know what a decline in my visual acuity can mean?

350
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:26,048
Meredith Grey / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): I'll set up some tests.

351
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,032
Dr. Webber / Mr. Franklin (PVM): Sure.

352
00:16:29,277 --> 00:16:30,899
Dr. Webber / Mr. Franklin (PVM): I know how the rumor mill runs around here.

353
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,421
Meredith Grey / Mr. Franklin (PVM): Let's just keep this to ourselves.

354
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,221
Dr. Webber / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Absolutely.

355
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:43,711
George O'Malley / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Yeah.

356
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,072
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Do you think she's talking about me?

357
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:46,932
Alex Karev / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): She's absolutely talking about you.

358
00:16:48,495 --> 00:16:49,437
Alex Karev / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Dude, that's a good thing.

359
00:16:49,495 --> 00:16:49,817
George O'Malley / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): No.

360
00:16:50,157 --> 00:16:51,238
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): No, it's not.

361
00:16:51,258 --> 00:16:52,538
Alex Karev / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Georgia, get a clue.

362
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:55,581
Alex Karev / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Syphilis is the best thing that ever happened to you.

363
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:57,124
Alex Karev / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): In their eyes, you're a player.

364
00:17:00,158 --> 00:17:00,957
Cristina Yang / Miss Henry (PVM): Hey, Sif boy.

365
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:02,860
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You told her?

366
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:04,221
Izzie Stevens / Miss Henry OR Mr. Franklin (PVM): Just Christina.

367
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,383
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Sif boy.

368
00:17:05,403 --> 00:17:06,324
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): It's got a nice ring to it.

369
00:17:06,423 --> 00:17:09,226
Cristina Yang / Mr. Franklin OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Kind of like Superboy, only diseased.

370
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:10,665
George O'Malley / Mr. Franklin (PVM): Izzy didn't have to say a word.

371
00:17:10,748 --> 00:17:14,029
Cristina Yang / Mr. Franklin (PVM): Around here, the only thing that spreads faster than disease is gossip.

372
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:14,730
George O'Malley / Mr. Franklin OR Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): It's not true.

373
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:17,814
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Mr. Franklin OR Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Just because Izzy can't keep her mouth shut doesn't mean everyone knows.

374
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:18,493
Unknown (likely a surgical team member or intern) / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Mr. Franklin OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Hey, George.

375
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:19,934
Unknown (likely another intern or surgical team member) / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): How are you feeling?

376
00:17:19,954 --> 00:17:21,135
Alex Karev / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Sorry about the syphilis.

377
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:25,601
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Everybody in this hospital knows.

378
00:17:25,621 --> 00:17:26,842
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Knows you're a player.

379
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,241
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You're disturbed.

380
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:28,982
Alex Karev / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): True.

381
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:31,188
Meredith Grey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Everybody's got a secret.

382
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,029
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Just be glad yours is out in the open.

383
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:33,490
Dr. George O'Malley: Oh, yeah?

384
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:34,432
Dr. George O'Malley: Alex, what's yours?

385
00:17:35,192 --> 00:17:36,394
Dr. Alex Karev: Show me yours, and I'll show you mine.

386
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:43,983
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I bet you've got some seriously kinky skeletons in your closet.

387
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:45,807
Dr. Alex Karev: What's in my closet is none of your business.

388
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:47,951
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Well, I don't have any secrets.

389
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:48,872
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): My life is boring.

390
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:51,173
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Everybody's got something to hide.

391
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:02,574
Dr. Preston Burke / Bill (PVM): Well, the mass we found is not a tumor.

392
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:04,036
Bill: Well, that's good, right?

393
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:05,538
Bill: Everything's got to be better than cancer.

394
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:07,338
Dr. Preston Burke / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Well, that's where it gets a little tricky.

395
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:16,510
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): The chromosomal tests have revealed that your body contains DNA from two different embryos that merged in the womb at the very beginning of development.

396
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:20,856
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): In rare cases, such as yours, the condition can produce gonadal hermaphroditism.

397
00:18:22,598 --> 00:18:24,162
Bill: I'm hearing scary words here, Preston.

398
00:18:24,182 --> 00:18:25,423
Bill: You know, pay cable kind of words.

399
00:18:25,864 --> 00:18:29,008
Dr. Preston Burke / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): In English, the mass on your bladder is an ovary.

400
00:18:30,507 --> 00:18:31,867
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Don't worry, we're going to remove it.

401
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,496
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): We have an excellent gynecological surgeon on staff.

402
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:38,897
Dr. George O'Malley: You're telling me I'm a guy with an ovary?

403
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,060
Alex / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): It's simply a quirk of nature, man.

404
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:49,054
Dr. George O'Malley: What am I going to tell Holly?

405
00:18:49,452 --> 00:18:50,414
Izzie / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. George O'Malley OR Bill (PVM): I bet you're going to be fine.

406
00:18:51,978 --> 00:18:52,919
Dr. George O'Malley: I'm still a man, right?

407
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,461
Alex / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): A man's man, a Kappa man.

408
00:18:56,324 --> 00:18:56,785
Alex / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I mean.

409
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:58,853
Dr. George O'Malley: You know, my sex life.

410
00:18:59,692 --> 00:19:00,775
Alex / Dr. George O'Malley OR Bill (PVM): You been having any problems?

411
00:19:02,258 --> 00:19:07,183
Patient (not main group) / Dr. George O'Malley OR Bill (PVM): Was it my very pregnant wife that gave it away?

412
00:19:07,203 --> 00:19:07,704
Alex / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Come on, man.

413
00:19:07,726 --> 00:19:08,125
Izzie / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Don't worry.

414
00:19:09,326 --> 00:19:10,107
Alex / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You never knew it was there.

415
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,111
Izzie / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You won't miss it when it's gone.

416
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:17,641
Dr. George O'Malley: Are you sure you know what you're doing?

417
00:19:17,661 --> 00:19:18,961
Izzie / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): It's a shot of penicillin, George.

418
00:19:19,021 --> 00:19:20,285
Izzie / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Be grateful I'm even doing this.

419
00:19:20,305 --> 00:19:22,468
Izzie / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I've already seen more of you than I ever wanted to.

420
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:24,280
Alex / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I'll be fighting nightmares for a week.

421
00:19:24,303 --> 00:19:24,843
Dr. George O'Malley: OK, you know what?

422
00:19:24,883 --> 00:19:25,324
Dr. George O'Malley: Forget this.

423
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:26,727
Izzie / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Do you want to get rid of the CIF or not?

424
00:19:27,406 --> 00:19:32,174
Alex / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Just shut up and drop them.

491
00:22:20,528 --> 00:22:23,152

528
00:24:09,401 --> 00:24:13,646
Cristina Yang / Bill OR Mr. Franklin OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): That's the one good thing about the fact neither of us is getting any, right?

00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:19,958
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Bill OR Mr. Franklin (PVM): Mr. Franklin, we've given you a local anesthetic, but you might feel some pressure.

534
00:24:38,906 --> 00:24:40,790

535
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:41,813
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Is it supposed to be bloody?

536
00:24:41,853 --> 00:24:43,557
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You've done this before, right?

537
00:24:43,855 --> 00:24:44,298

538
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:45,480

541
00:24:52,644 --> 00:25:02,579
Meredith Grey / Mr. Franklin OR Dr. George O'Malley OR Mr. Franklin (PVM): Now all we have to do is wait.

542
00:25:08,711 --> 00:25:09,652
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): You see that right there?

543
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:10,394
Another Doctor / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Mm-hmm.

544
00:25:11,413 --> 00:25:11,976
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): It's a tumor.

545
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:14,881
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Mr. Franklin (PVM): And it's pressing against your optic nerve.

546
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:15,682
Patient / Mr. Franklin (PVM): Is it operable?

547
00:25:15,701 --> 00:25:16,303
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Oh, definitely.

548
00:25:18,207 --> 00:25:19,989

549
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:21,951

550
00:25:22,892 --> 00:25:23,030
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Mm-hmm.

551
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:23,751

552
00:25:24,153 --> 00:25:25,755

553
00:25:26,076 --> 00:25:27,096
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Well, it's probably unrelated.

554
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,118
Patient / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): All right, Derek.

555
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,021

00:25:37,366 --> 00:25:37,509
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Mm-hmm.

560
00:25:37,528 --> 00:25:38,848
Patient / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): And I still want this kept under wraps.

561
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,790

562
00:25:41,011 --> 00:25:41,913
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Aren't I one of the vultures?

563
00:25:42,314 --> 00:25:44,615
Patient / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Why, do you think I want to keep an eye on you?

564
00:25:44,635 --> 00:25:45,076
Patient / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Get going.

565
00:25:45,438 --> 00:25:46,317

569
00:25:57,636 --> 00:25:58,377
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Can you keep a secret?

570
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:00,300
Burke / Olivia Harper (PVM): Better than you think.

571
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,087
Dr. Knox / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. George O'Malley OR Olivia Harper (PVM): How much fluid can one body hold?

572
00:26:05,107 --> 00:26:05,588
Burke / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Shh.

573
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,954
Burke / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): There's a lot of fluid in there, Mr. Franklin, but we're almost finished.

574
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:12,621
Burke / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Mr. Franklin?

575
00:26:14,103 --> 00:26:14,541
Dr. Knox / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You sleeping?

576
00:26:16,905 --> 00:26:17,468
Burke / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Mr. Franklin?

577
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,309
Dr. Knox / Miss Henry OR Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): He has no pulse.

578
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:19,651
Burke / Miss Henry (PVM): What?

579
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:20,833
Dr. Knox / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): He has no pulse!

580
00:26:37,469 --> 00:26:39,951
Dr. Knox / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): How could he die just like that with no warning?

581
00:26:39,971 --> 00:26:41,714
Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): There was blood in the tube when it first went in.

582
00:26:42,277 --> 00:26:42,939
Dr. Knox / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): What if it's our fault?

583
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:43,759
Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): What if we did something wrong?

584
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:44,780
Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): We didn't do anything wrong.

585
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,663
Dr. Knox / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): We did a textbook procedure.

586
00:26:48,989 --> 00:26:49,871
Dr. Knox / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I checked your chart.

587
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,313
Burke / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You did everything by the book.

588
00:26:51,432 --> 00:26:52,173
Dr. Knox / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): He died on our watch.

589
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,237
Burke / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): We must have missed something.

590
00:26:53,557 --> 00:26:54,259
Dr. Knox / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You couldn't have known.

591
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:56,040
Burke / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): There was no history of heart problems.

592
00:26:56,362 --> 00:26:57,462
Dr. Knox / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): His death wasn't your fault.

593
00:26:58,045 --> 00:26:58,726
Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): When's the autopsy?

594
00:26:59,086 --> 00:27:00,169
Dr. Knox / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): There's going to be an autopsy.

595
00:27:00,976 --> 00:27:01,214
Burke / Miss Henry (PVM): What?

596
00:27:01,717 --> 00:27:03,239
Dr. Knox / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Well, how are we supposed to know the cause of death?

597
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:07,443
Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): It's going down as cardiopulmonary arrest complicated by liver disease.

598
00:27:07,723 --> 00:27:12,490
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): But an autopsy will... The family decided they didn't want an autopsy.

599
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,815
Dr. Burke / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): But, Dr. Bailey... They don't want an autopsy.

600
00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:15,576
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Let it go.

601
00:27:20,781 --> 00:27:22,044
Hospital PA System / Unknown (PVM): Dr. Burke to cardiology.

602
00:27:22,064 --> 00:27:22,545
Hospital PA System / Unknown (PVM): Dr. Burke to cardiology.

603
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:30,865
Dr. Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): How goes our special super secret silent sunset surgery?

604
00:27:31,846 --> 00:27:33,288
Dr. Meredith Grey / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I've been practicing that.

605
00:27:33,307 --> 00:27:34,647
Dr. Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You have too much time on your hands.

606
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,912
Dr. Burke / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Uh, tell the chief I'll be there.

607
00:27:36,951 --> 00:27:38,814
Dr. Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Just let me know when and where I'm in.

608
00:27:40,934 --> 00:27:41,395
Dr. Meredith Grey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Okay.

609
00:27:41,415 --> 00:27:44,519
Dr. Cristina Yang / Olivia Harper OR Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Are you nervous?

610
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,922
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): It's a complicated surgery.

611
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:47,041
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I'm gonna make one mistake.

612
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,324
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I end a fellow surgeon's career.

613
00:27:48,963 --> 00:27:49,826
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): My mentor's career.

614
00:27:49,846 --> 00:27:50,086
Dr. Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Oh, no.

615
00:27:50,727 --> 00:27:51,346
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I'm not nervous.

616
00:27:53,868 --> 00:27:55,372
Dr. Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): So just for the record... Mm-hmm?

617
00:27:55,392 --> 00:27:57,272
Dr. Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You tell me if I need to get tested, right?

618
00:27:58,433 --> 00:27:59,596
Dr. Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I have syphilis.

619
00:27:59,615 --> 00:28:00,317
Dr. Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): No, I don't.

620
00:28:00,557 --> 00:28:02,597
Dr. Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): It's just we never made any rules or anything.

621
00:28:02,637 --> 00:28:06,221
Dr. Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Olivia Harper (PVM): I mean, we never said we have rules.

622
00:28:06,323 --> 00:28:08,285
Dr. Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): And I wouldn't hold it against you.

623
00:28:08,463 --> 00:28:10,747
Dr. Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): When would I have time to go out and get syphilis?

624
00:28:11,346 --> 00:28:12,489
Dr. Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You're handful enough as it is.

625
00:28:12,548 --> 00:28:14,951
Dr. Meredith Grey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): And besides, we're practically a condom ad.

626
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,153
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): But no more glow in the dark ones.

627
00:28:17,712 --> 00:28:19,174
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): You see, there's nothing to worry about.

628
00:28:19,214 --> 00:28:23,200
Meredith Grey / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Olivia Harper (PVM): Maybe we should, you know, pick some walls, I mean.

629
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:23,558
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Olivia Harper (PVM): We should.

630
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:25,500
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): OK.

631
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:25,740
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): OK.

632
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,853
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): I like the glow-in-the-dark ones.

633
00:28:32,873 --> 00:28:33,854
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I bet you do.

634
00:28:42,102 --> 00:28:44,124
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): That's the last of the bilbarian material.

635
00:28:44,663 --> 00:28:47,287
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I just need to sew up the perforation on the bladder wall.

636
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,309
Dr. Bailey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Is there a problem, Dr. Knox?

637
00:28:52,892 --> 00:28:54,913
Dr. Knox / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Well, you said this man's wife is pregnant?

638
00:28:55,473 --> 00:28:56,173
Dr. Bailey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Due in five weeks.

639
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:56,394
Dr. Knox / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Why?

640
00:28:56,914 --> 00:28:59,136
Dr. Knox / Mr. Franklin OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Our patient has a blind vest difference.

641
00:29:01,362 --> 00:29:01,981
Dr. Knox / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Bill is sterile.

642
00:29:02,544 --> 00:29:03,403
Dr. Knox / Mr. Franklin (PVM): And always has been.

643
00:29:05,406 --> 00:29:06,950
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Then who got his wife pregnant?

644
00:29:10,996 --> 00:29:13,538
Izzie Stevens / Unknown (PVM): Oh.

645
00:29:13,617 --> 00:29:14,140
Meredith Grey / Unknown (PVM): Oh.

646
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,760
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Sucks to be Bill right now.

647
00:29:16,063 --> 00:29:18,045
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): How's Burke going to tell him the baby's not his?

648
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,445
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Burke's not going to tell him.

649
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:19,948
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): He has to.

650
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:20,528
Meredith Grey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): They're friends.

651
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:21,871
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Bill's better off not knowing.

652
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:23,731
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Do you think Holly knows Bill's not the father?

653
00:29:23,751 --> 00:29:24,452
Meredith Grey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Maybe, maybe not.

654
00:29:24,535 --> 00:29:25,855
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I think Bill should know his wife's cheating on him.

655
00:29:25,957 --> 00:29:26,998
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I'd want to know.

656
00:29:27,586 --> 00:29:30,691
Meredith Grey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I don't remember asking for your opinions, so keep them to yourselves.

657
00:29:31,152 --> 00:29:32,972
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Sorry, sir.

658
00:29:32,992 --> 00:29:33,914
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You're such a gossip.

659
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:43,671
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): We know how confusing this must be, your husband dying so suddenly.

660
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,275
Cristina Yang / Mr. Franklin OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): But an autopsy will tell us why.

661
00:29:47,415 --> 00:29:49,941
Family Member (Mrs. Franklin or Alice) / Mr. Franklin (PVM): So you think we should do the autopsy?

662
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,884
Family Member (Alice or Mrs. Franklin) / Mr. Franklin (PVM): No, we just want this to be over.

663
00:29:52,182 --> 00:29:54,807
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): But don't you want to know for certain what killed him?

664
00:29:56,069 --> 00:29:58,375
Alice Franklin / Mr. Franklin OR Miss Henry (PVM): My father was a mean drunk who couldn't hold a job.

665
00:29:58,413 --> 00:30:00,198
Alice Franklin / Miss Henry (PVM): That's what killed him.

666
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:05,826
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I understand that you're angry, but knowing for sure might help give you some closure.

667
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:09,634
Mrs. Franklin / Miss Henry OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): And it was awfully sudden, Alice.

668
00:30:09,653 --> 00:30:10,055
Alice Franklin / Miss Henry OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Sudden?

669
00:30:11,217 --> 00:30:12,900
Alice Franklin / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Miss Henry (PVM): He's been killing himself for years.

670
00:30:13,721 --> 00:30:14,721
Mrs. Franklin / Mr. Franklin (PVM): He was a good man.

671
00:30:16,605 --> 00:30:17,708
Mrs. Franklin / Mr. Franklin (PVM): Maybe they're right.

672
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:19,651
Mrs. Franklin / Mr. Franklin (PVM): Maybe we should do the autopsy.

673
00:30:19,671 --> 00:30:21,775
Alice Franklin / Mr. Franklin (PVM): Mom, stop it.

674
00:30:21,923 --> 00:30:22,605
Alice Franklin / Mr. Franklin (PVM): He's dead.

675
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:24,868
Alice Franklin / Mr. Franklin (PVM): It's finally over.

676
00:30:25,893 --> 00:30:28,597
Mrs. Franklin / Mr. Franklin (PVM): Alice, your father would have wanted to.

677
00:30:28,699 --> 00:30:29,961
Alice Franklin / Mr. Franklin (PVM): Who cares what he wanted?

678
00:30:29,981 --> 00:30:36,336
Alice Franklin / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Mr. Franklin (PVM): Can't we please just try and get out of this with whatever shred of dignity this family has left?

679
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:53,747
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): You guys want to perform an unauthorized autopsy.

680
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,269
Meredith Grey / Miss Henry (PVM): I know you, Christina.

681
00:30:56,329 --> 00:30:58,574
Meredith Grey / Miss Henry (PVM): You do not want to be known as a new 007.

682
00:30:58,894 --> 00:31:00,115
Cristina Yang / Miss Henry (PVM): An autopsy clears your name.

683
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,961
Meredith Grey / Miss Henry OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Christina, no.

684
00:31:03,602 --> 00:31:04,501
Izzie Stevens / Miss Henry (PVM): What about Franklin's wife?

685
00:31:05,022 --> 00:31:06,444
Cristina Yang / Miss Henry (PVM): You saw the way she was looking at me.

686
00:31:06,486 --> 00:31:07,728
Cristina Yang / Miss Henry (PVM): She wants the autopsy.

687
00:31:07,748 --> 00:31:09,009
Izzie Stevens / Miss Henry (PVM): She just didn't want to fight with her daughter.

688
00:31:09,048 --> 00:31:10,332
Izzie Stevens / Miss Henry (PVM): She looks so sad.

689
00:31:10,372 --> 00:31:14,678
Alex Karev / Miss Henry OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Okay, Christina Yang, license to kill.

690
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,373
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Okay, I'm in.

691
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,717
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I am so not involved in this.

692
00:31:21,957 --> 00:31:23,117
Cristina Yang / Mr. Franklin (PVM): Meredith, this is Fight Club.

693
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:24,181
Cristina Yang / Mr. Franklin (PVM): Nobody talks about it.

694
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:24,800
Meredith Grey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Fine.

695
00:31:26,001 --> 00:31:27,243
Cristina Yang / Mr. Franklin (PVM): We have to do it when Bailey's not around.

696
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:28,185
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Bailey's always around.

697
00:31:28,227 --> 00:31:29,469
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): She's everywhere and knows everything.

698
00:31:29,647 --> 00:31:30,769
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Well, we have to take our chances.

699
00:31:31,412 --> 00:31:33,914
Alex Karev / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Bailey's got something tonight from 7 to 11.

700
00:31:33,954 --> 00:31:35,699
Alex Karev / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You two will be the last thing she's worried about.

701
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:36,538
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): How do you know that?

702
00:31:36,701 --> 00:31:37,382
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): What kind of something?

703
00:31:38,323 --> 00:31:39,505
Alex Karev / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Oh, I can't tell you that.

704
00:31:39,785 --> 00:31:40,767
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): It's Fight Club 2.

705
00:31:43,884 --> 00:31:54,842
George O'Malley / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Mr. Franklin OR Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): If I'm missing out on a real patient because of this, they're going to call me 007 because I've killed you.

706
00:31:57,065 --> 00:31:57,526
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): How we doing?

707
00:31:57,967 --> 00:31:58,886
Cristina Yang / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Did you lock up the gallery?

708
00:31:59,509 --> 00:31:59,847
Alex Karev / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Don't worry.

709
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:00,871
Cristina Yang / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): We're flying under the radar.

710
00:32:01,131 --> 00:32:02,413

711
00:32:02,432 --> 00:32:03,114

712
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:04,836
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): We've got it, Chief.

713
00:32:04,855 --> 00:32:06,077
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Mr. Franklin (PVM): How much vancomycin is there?

714
00:32:06,228 --> 00:32:07,809

715
00:32:07,951 --> 00:32:10,095
Miranda Bailey / Mr. Franklin (PVM): You're not going to be too liberal with those benzos, are you?

716
00:32:10,515 --> 00:32:12,356
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You know, doctors make the worst patients.

717
00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:14,320
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Why don't you just breathe in the happy gas?

718
00:32:14,662 --> 00:32:16,025
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Stop running my OR.

719
00:32:18,268 --> 00:32:18,387

720
00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:19,130

722
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,250
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Miss Henry OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): We're body snatchers.

723
00:32:33,108 --> 00:32:34,932
Izzie Stevens / Mr. Franklin OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): What if somebody from the morgue comes looking for Franklin?

724
00:32:35,132 --> 00:32:40,238
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Mr. Franklin (PVM): Well, A, it's in the middle of the night, and B, the thing about being dead is people stop looking for you.

725
00:32:44,182 --> 00:32:44,241
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): OK.

726
00:32:44,261 --> 00:32:45,564

Cristina Yang / Mr. Franklin (PVM): Uh, if we're going to do this, we're going to do it right.

735
00:33:05,054 --> 00:33:05,653
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): OK, got it.

736
00:33:06,173 --> 00:33:06,454

737
00:33:06,496 --> 00:33:08,678
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Mr. Franklin (PVM): It's not like we can kill him twice.

738
00:33:13,824 --> 00:33:14,423
Intern (possibly George, Cristina, or Izzie) / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Let me cut.

739
00:33:14,605 --> 00:33:15,684
Bailey / Mr. Franklin OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You'll get your turn.

740
00:33:19,368 --> 00:33:21,112
Intern (possibly Cristina Yang) / Mr. Franklin (PVM): You should really be using the 10 blade.

741
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:22,354
Bailey / Mr. Franklin (PVM): Will you stop backseat cutting?

742
00:33:22,594 --> 00:33:23,993
Intern (possibly George) / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Mr. Franklin (PVM): We'll get the saw.

743
00:33:24,016 --> 00:33:27,117
Intern (possibly Izzie Stevens) / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): OK, I've sutured the drain in place.

744
00:33:27,137 --> 00:33:28,298

745
00:33:28,721 --> 00:33:29,422

00:33:29,461 --> 00:33:30,541

750
00:33:37,655 --> 00:33:39,941

751
00:33:39,961 --> 00:33:41,722
Intern (possibly Izzie Stevens) / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Do you think the optic nerve is damaged?

752
00:33:42,806 --> 00:33:46,310
Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): If it is, when he wakes up, he'll be blind.

753
00:33:47,794 --> 00:33:48,375
Intern (possibly George O'Malley) / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): For how long?

754
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:49,675
Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Forever.

755
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:54,285
Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Paige, Stevens, and Yang, tell them I want them covering your patients.

756
00:33:54,924 --> 00:33:58,332
Bailey / Mr. Franklin OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I need you to stay and monitor the chief.

757
00:34:00,218 --> 00:34:04,083
Intern (possibly Meredith Grey) / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Christina and Izzy, I think they're already swamped.

758
00:34:04,762 --> 00:34:05,182

759
00:34:05,683 --> 00:34:06,065
Intern (possibly Meredith Grey) / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Labs.

760
00:34:06,726 --> 00:34:08,228
Intern (possibly Meredith Grey) / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): They had to check on some labs.

761
00:34:10,891 --> 00:34:12,632
Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Oh, you are lying.

762
00:34:14,474 --> 00:34:15,476
Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I know you're lying.

763
00:34:15,516 --> 00:34:16,398
Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You know how I know?

764
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:17,679
Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Because you're a bad liar.

765
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,802
Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I hate a bad liar.

766
00:34:25,248 --> 00:34:25,849

00:34:26,768 --> 00:34:28,452

768
00:34:28,693 --> 00:34:29,853
Unknown / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Here, take over for me.

769
00:34:37,782 --> 00:34:39,463
Preston Burke / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Your whole relationship is a lie.

770
00:34:41,065 --> 00:34:41,686
Molly / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): We're happy.

771
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:43,929
Molly / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): We've wanted a child for a long time.

772
00:34:44,268 --> 00:34:45,791
Molly / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Why do you want to take this away from him?

773
00:34:45,811 --> 00:34:46,913
Preston Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Does he know you've been cheating on him?

774
00:34:46,931 --> 00:34:49,315
Molly / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Preston, this is between Bill and me.

775
00:34:49,496 --> 00:34:51,458
Preston Burke / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): The man has a right to know that this isn't his child.

776
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:54,762
Molly / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Mr. Franklin (PVM): Please, just let this go.

777
00:34:55,081 --> 00:34:56,181
Preston Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Why can't you let this go?

778
00:34:56,402 --> 00:34:57,625
Preston Burke / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Because Bill is my best friend.

779
00:34:57,643 --> 00:34:58,105
Preston Burke / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): That's why.

780
00:34:58,166 --> 00:34:59,246
Molly / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You were really his friend.

781
00:34:59,606 --> 00:35:00,447
Molly / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You wouldn't do this.

782
00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:01,768
Preston Burke / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Molly, please, tell him the truth.

783
00:35:01,929 --> 00:35:02,230
Molly / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Why?

784
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,672
Molly / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I'm not going to ruin my life because you think this is wrong.

785
00:35:05,713 --> 00:35:06,355
Preston Burke / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Your life?

786
00:35:07,059 --> 00:35:07,860
Preston Burke / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): What about his life?

787
00:35:08,161 --> 00:35:09,282
Preston Burke / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): What about this child's life?

788
00:35:10,443 --> 00:35:11,864
Molly / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): What Bill doesn't know won't hurt him.

789
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:15,650
Preston Burke / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Fine.

790
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,135
Preston Burke / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Maybe his friend wouldn't tell him the truth.

791
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:31,070
Preston Burke / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. Meredith Gray OR Bill (PVM): But I'm also his doctor, and his doctor is not going to lie to him.

792
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:34,355
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Miss Henry (PVM): I know, but something came up, an important surgery, and I couldn't.

793
00:35:35,076 --> 00:35:36,898
Derek Shepherd / Miss Henry (PVM): I'm just sorry you couldn't be there for your mother.

794
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:40,405
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Miss Henry, if my mother were lucid, she would understand.

795
00:35:40,507 --> 00:35:41,268
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): She's a surgeon.

796
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,351
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): She's done this countless times.

797
00:35:44,092 --> 00:35:46,655
Dr. Meredith Gray: And besides, she doesn't even know who I am anyway, so.

798
00:35:46,675 --> 00:35:48,157
Miss Henry / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Miss Henry (PVM): Today she did.

799
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:49,860
Dr. Meredith Gray: What?

800
00:35:50,802 --> 00:35:53,646
Miss Henry / Miss Henry (PVM): Your mother's been asking when her daughter Meredith gets off from work.

801
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:00,076
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Hey.

802
00:36:00,096 --> 00:36:01,538
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Hey.

803
00:36:01,556 --> 00:36:02,920
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): A lot of secret phone calls today.

804
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:10,547
Dr. Meredith Gray: Yeah, it's my mother.

805
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:16,715
Dr. Meredith Gray: She isn't traveling.

806
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:19,478
Dr. Meredith Gray: She isn't writing a book.

807
00:36:21,382 --> 00:36:22,143
Dr. Meredith Gray: She isn't anything.

808
00:36:22,202 --> 00:36:24,125
Dr. Meredith Gray: I've been lying to everyone.

809
00:36:25,887 --> 00:36:26,168
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Why?

810
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:29,371
Dr. Meredith Gray: She has Alzheimer's.

811
00:36:31,574 --> 00:36:32,175
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): How advanced?

812
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:32,675
Dr. Meredith Gray: Very.

813
00:36:33,556 --> 00:36:34,217
Dr. Meredith Gray: She's in a home.

814
00:36:34,777 --> 00:36:36,501
Dr. Meredith Gray: And I'm the only one who even knows she's sick.

815
00:36:38,016 --> 00:37:01,170
Dr. Meredith Gray: I just don't know what to do anymore, you know?

816
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:05,356
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Don't even tell me you're doing what I think you're doing.

817
00:37:10,264 --> 00:37:21,237
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Miss Henry OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Not only did you disregard the family's wishes, you broke the law.

818
00:37:21,257 --> 00:37:23,159
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You could be arrested for assault.

819
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:24,581

820
00:37:25,141 --> 00:37:26,623

821
00:37:26,664 --> 00:37:28,925

822
00:37:29,045 --> 00:37:30,728
Unknown / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I like my job.

823
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,833
Unknown / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Did you think about any of this before you started cutting open a poor man's body?

824
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:37,295
Unknown / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I could seriously kick both your asses right now.

825
00:37:37,416 --> 00:37:39,157
Unknown / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Do you have anything to say?

826
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:42,056

827
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:43,998

828
00:37:44,297 --> 00:37:45,581

829
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:47,822

830
00:37:48,063 --> 00:37:49,385
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): We want to run some tests.

831
00:37:49,405 --> 00:37:51,447
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Mr. Franklin (PVM): Oh, now you want to run tests.

832
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:52,668
Unknown / Mr. Franklin (PVM): At this point, what could it hurt?

833
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:57,333
Unknown / Olivia Harper OR Mr. Franklin (PVM): I hate both of you right now.

834
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:09,146
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Bill (PVM): Lab 2743, extension 2743.

835
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:09,567
Unknown / Bill (PVM): Meredith.

836
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:11,938
Unknown / Bill (PVM): He's an attendee.

837
00:38:12,641 --> 00:38:13,581
Unknown / Bill (PVM): You're an intern.

838
00:38:14,322 --> 00:38:14,902
Unknown / Olivia Harper (PVM): You saw us?

839
00:38:16,405 --> 00:38:17,188
Unknown / Olivia Harper (PVM): You can see.

840
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:22,155
Unknown / Olivia Harper OR Bill (PVM): I'm going to tell you what your mother would say if she were here.

841
00:38:24,418 --> 00:38:26,742
Unknown / Bill (PVM): You're making a mistake, a big one.

842
00:38:29,487 --> 00:38:31,469
Unknown / Olivia Harper (PVM): And I would tell my mother it's not a mistake.

843
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:38,577
Unknown / Mr. Franklin OR Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): We specifically said no autopsy.

844
00:38:38,597 --> 00:38:41,422
Unknown / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I understand why you're upset.

845
00:38:41,601 --> 00:38:42,322
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You understand.

846
00:38:43,744 --> 00:38:44,646
Unknown / Mr. Franklin (PVM): We're going to get an attorney.

847
00:38:45,246 --> 00:38:46,228
Unknown / Mr. Franklin (PVM): Come on, Mom.

848
00:38:46,248 --> 00:38:47,090
Unknown / Mr. Franklin (PVM): We know what killed him.

849
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:50,655
Unknown / Mr. Franklin (PVM): He had a blood condition known as hematomacrosis.

850
00:38:51,335 --> 00:38:58,387
Dr. Burke / Mr. Franklin (PVM): The disease causes an excess amount of iron to build up in the body, and that's what caused the heart failure, not the paracentesis.

851
00:38:58,766 --> 00:39:02,012
Patient's Family Member / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): But I thought he was always so sick because of the drinking.
