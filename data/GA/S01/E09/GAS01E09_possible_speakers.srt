Bill (the patient) / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): It's gone from torturing pledges to torturing interns.

153
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,057
Bill (the patient) / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Am I right?

154
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:15,560
Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Be very careful how you two answer that.

155
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:18,749
Bill (the patient) / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): I could tell some stories.

156
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:21,312
Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Bill, you have a camera snaking up your mojo.

157
00:07:21,332 --> 00:07:22,595
Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke OR George O'Malley (PVM): It's not the time to cross me.

158
00:07:22,615 --> 00:07:24,036
Meredith Grey / George O'Malley (PVM): It isn't anything too serious.

159
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:26,199
Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): That's what this procedure will tell us.

160
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:30,144
Bill (the patient) / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): You don't worry about anything but growing my godson in there.

161
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:31,747
Pregnant Woman (Bill's partner) / George O'Malley (PVM): He kicks like you wouldn't believe.

162
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:33,149
Bill (the patient) / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Badass, just like his father.

163
00:07:35,052 --> 00:07:35,874
Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Move a little to the right.

164
00:07:36,954 --> 00:07:37,516
Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Your other right.

165
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:38,838
Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): There.

166
00:07:39,677 --> 00:07:40,139
Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): What do you see?

167
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:40,939
Intern (Meredith/George/Izzie) / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): What is it?

168
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,812
Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Could be any number of things.

169
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:44,975
Dr. Preston Burke: O'Malley, take a biopsy of the mass.

170
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:46,797
Dr. Preston Burke: Dr. Karev, schedule a CT.

171
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:57,749
Preston Burke / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. Preston Burke OR Patricia OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Let's not worry until we have to.

172
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:58,709
Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): That's too much damage.

173
00:08:01,252 --> 00:08:04,396
Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): We'll have to remove most of the colon instead of a local resection.

174
00:08:23,884 --> 00:08:24,605
Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): More suture.

175
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:26,447
Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): And what's with these damn lights in here?

176
00:08:30,252 --> 00:08:38,224
Dr. Burke / George O'Malley (PVM): Mr. Franklin, how long has your abdomen been like this?

177
00:08:39,205 --> 00:08:40,706
Mr. Franklin: It's been getting bigger for a while.

178
00:08:40,725 --> 00:08:42,889
Mrs. Franklin / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Mr. Franklin OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I told him there was something wrong.

179
00:08:43,431 --> 00:08:45,572
Mrs. Franklin / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): No one gets fat like this so fast.

180
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:46,134
Mrs. Franklin / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I told him.

181
00:08:46,514 --> 00:08:47,495
Another family member / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Everybody told him.

182
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:50,067
Dr. Burke / George O'Malley (PVM): He has dullness to percussion and spider angiomas.

183
00:08:50,368 --> 00:08:51,048
Mrs. Franklin / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): What's all that mean?

184
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:54,351
Dr. Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): It means we have to admit your father and run some tests.

185
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:54,974
Mr. Franklin's child / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Great.

186
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:57,034
Alice / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): What's that going to cost us this time?

187
00:08:57,677 --> 00:08:58,697
Mr. Franklin / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Alice, don't.

188
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:06,826
Lab Tech / George O'Malley (PVM): Results for George O'Malley.

189
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:10,711
Lab Tech / Mr. Franklin (PVM): I don't see it here.

190
00:09:10,731 --> 00:09:11,452
George / Mr. Franklin OR George O'Malley (PVM): What's the patient's name?

191
00:09:11,474 --> 00:09:12,115
George / Mr. Franklin OR George O'Malley (PVM): O'Malley, George.

192
00:09:12,153 --> 00:09:14,398
George / Mr. Franklin OR George O'Malley (PVM): Look, it's just a simple blood test.

193
00:09:14,418 --> 00:09:14,697
Lab Tech / Mr. Franklin OR George O'Malley (PVM): Here we go.

194
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:25,066
George / George O'Malley (PVM): Franklin, Jordan, I need this back ASAP.

195
00:09:25,186 --> 00:09:25,947
Alex / Mr. Franklin (PVM): What a shocker.

196
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:28,912
Alex / George O'Malley (PVM): Hey, did you get something good?

197
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:29,734
Alex / George O'Malley (PVM): Syphilis?

198
00:09:29,812 --> 00:09:30,413
George / George O'Malley (PVM): It's not surgical.

199
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:31,096
Izzie / George O'Malley (PVM): Who has syphilis?

200
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:35,582
George / George O'Malley (PVM): Excuse us.

201
00:09:35,604 --> 00:09:35,945
Alex / George O'Malley (PVM): Sorry.

202
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:41,072
Izzie / Alex Karev OR George O'Malley (PVM): You have syphilis?

203
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:49,383
George O'Malley: I don't know how this happened.

204
00:09:50,004 --> 00:09:50,706
Alex Karev: Of course you do.

205
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:52,951
Izzie / George O'Malley OR George O'Malley (PVM): God, Olivia must really be getting around.

206
00:09:52,971 --> 00:09:53,893
George O'Malley: Olivia, she's not like that.

207
00:09:54,514 --> 00:09:55,658
Alex Karev: It's a new millennium, George.

208
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:58,683
Alex Karev: The only people who aren't like that are the Amish, and apparently you.

209
00:09:59,384 --> 00:09:59,868
George O'Malley: You don't know.

210
00:09:59,908 --> 00:10:02,173
George O'Malley: Maybe I've been sleeping around.

211
00:10:02,692 --> 00:10:03,755
George O'Malley / George O'Malley (PVM): Maybe I got ladies.

212
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:06,403
Alex Karev / George O'Malley (PVM): Shut up.

213
00:10:07,312 --> 00:10:07,971
George O'Malley / George O'Malley (PVM): What am I gonna do?

214
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:08,952
Alex Karev / George O'Malley (PVM): It's no biggie.

215
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:10,875
Alex Karev / George O'Malley (PVM): Couple doses of penicillin will knock it right out.

216
00:10:10,897 --> 00:10:12,119
George O'Malley: What am I gonna do about Olivia?

217
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:13,879
Alex Karev / George O'Malley (PVM): Well, for starters, stop sleeping with her.

218
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,605
Alex Karev / George O'Malley OR George O'Malley (PVM): Unless you want that thing to fall off.

219
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,605
George O'Malley: Okay, that is twice.

220
00:10:17,904 --> 00:10:22,851
George O'Malley: That you've trash-talked the girl that I could one day potentially, well, not love, but like a whole lot.

221
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:26,138
Cristina Yang / George O'Malley (PVM): If she gave it to you, you have to tell her.

222
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:27,259
George O'Malley / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Fine.

223
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,399
Cristina Yang / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Fine.

224
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:29,461
Cristina Yang / George O'Malley (PVM): She didn't give it to you.

225
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,124
Cristina Yang / George O'Malley (PVM): She was a virgin when you met.

226
00:10:32,326 --> 00:10:33,888
Cristina Yang / George O'Malley (PVM): You still have to tell her so she can get tested.

227
00:10:34,187 --> 00:10:34,788
George O'Malley: Oh, yeah?

228
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,812
George O'Malley: How am I gonna tell her?

229
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,807
George O'Malley: Uh, hey, Olivia, how you doing?

230
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:41,649
George O'Malley: By the way, I got the CIF.

231
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:42,350
George O'Malley: How about you?

232
00:10:42,551 --> 00:10:43,572
Cristina Yang / George O'Malley OR George O'Malley (PVM): Well, maybe not quite like that.

233
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:44,451
George O'Malley: No, it's good advice.

234
00:10:44,493 --> 00:10:45,254
George O'Malley: Really good advice.

235
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:46,033
George O'Malley: Thank you very much.

236
00:10:46,956 --> 00:10:47,657
Cristina Yang / Mr. Franklin OR Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Retract here.

237
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:50,080
Alex Karev / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Here.

238
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,601
Cristina Yang / Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Oh, this just isn't holding.

239
00:10:52,623 --> 00:10:56,225
Cristina Yang / Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Give me a bigger retractor, please.

240
00:10:56,245 --> 00:10:57,028
Alex Karev / Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Sorry, Doctor.

241
00:10:57,048 --> 00:10:57,567
Cristina Yang / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): It wasn't you.

242
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,614
Dr. Richard Webber: Dr. Bailey, you can finish this.

243
00:11:04,178 --> 00:11:05,740
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Thank you, Chief.

244
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,942
Dr. Miranda Bailey: I appreciate the opportunity.

245
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:25,508
Dr. Miranda Bailey / George O'Malley OR George O'Malley OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I gotta say, George, I didn't think you had it in you.

246
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:26,528
Cristina Yang / George O'Malley (PVM): It's always the quiet ones.

247
00:11:27,471 --> 00:11:28,211
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): So who's the woman?

248
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,932
George O'Malley: None of your business.

249
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:29,994
Cristina Yang / George O'Malley (PVM): Oh, come on.

250
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,297
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): Who gave you the cooties on the playground?

251
00:11:32,868 --> 00:11:35,072
Alex Karev / Dr. Meredith Gray OR George O'Malley OR George O'Malley (PVM): You must have had something like this before, right?

252
00:11:35,552 --> 00:11:37,417
George O'Malley: I never talk about my penis with other men.

253
00:11:40,802 --> 00:11:42,706
Alex Karev / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I don't know, either, normally.

254
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:48,635
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): We better get Burke.

255
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,412
Cristina Yang / George O'Malley (PVM): Mr. Franklin?

256
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,639
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You have a condition known as ascites.

257
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,440
Alice (Mr. Franklin's wife or daughter) / George O'Malley (PVM): Oh, my god.

258
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,519
Mr. Franklin / George O'Malley (PVM): I knew it was terrible.

259
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:07,065
Cristina Yang / George O'Malley (PVM): Just means there's fluid in the peritoneal cavity, the abdomen.

260
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:10,648
Cristina Yang / George O'Malley (PVM): And the swelling is pressing against your lungs, which is why you're having trouble breathing.

261
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:12,908
Cristina Yang / George O'Malley (PVM): In your case, it looks like a symptom of liver disease.

262
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:15,432
Alice / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Alex Karev (PVM): And it all comes together.

263
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:16,952
Mr. Franklin / Miss Henry OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Alice, not now.

264
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:19,195
Cristina Yang / Miss Henry OR Dr. Meredith Gray OR Alex Karev (PVM): Is there something we should know?

265
00:12:19,235 --> 00:12:23,980
Mr. Franklin: I drink a bit.

266
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,041
Alice / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): That's the understatement of the year.

267
00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:28,101
Mr. Franklin / Mr. Franklin (PVM): That's enough out of you.

268
00:12:28,302 --> 00:12:36,413
Alice / Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Hey, I'm only here for mom, to make sure you don't pull any of your usual crap.

269
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:38,798
Cristina Yang / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): There's definitely a growth protruding into the bladder.

270
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:39,960
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): But look at the edges.

271
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,062
Cristina Yang / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): I don't think it's a tumor.

272
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:42,682
Alex Karev / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Kind of shaped like an ovary.

273
00:12:43,183 --> 00:12:45,388
Dr. Preston Burke: That the flip answer you're going to give your patient, Dr. Karev?

274
00:12:46,428 --> 00:12:47,610
Alex Karev: This is one of my oldest friends.

275
00:12:47,652 --> 00:12:49,033
Dr. Preston Burke: You might want to take this seriously.

276
00:12:49,413 --> 00:12:50,096
Alex Karev: I'm sorry, sir.

277
00:12:50,456 --> 00:12:50,937
Dr. Preston Burke: You better be.

278
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,302
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): I got the rest of the labs back.

279
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:56,706
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): They did a chromosome analysis of the tissue.

280
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,451
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): You won't believe this.

281
00:13:04,716 --> 00:13:06,960
Alex Karev / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Bill has an ovary?

282
00:13:14,865 --> 00:13:17,970
George O'Malley / George O'Malley (PVM): According to his daughter, Mr. Franklin is a heavy drinker.

283
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,171
Alex Karev / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR George O'Malley OR Alex Karev OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Six to eight drinks a day.

284
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,552
Dr. Miranda Bailey / George O'Malley (PVM): An alcoholic by any standard.

285
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:21,293
Dr. Miranda Bailey / George O'Malley (PVM): Protocol?

286
00:13:21,673 --> 00:13:22,614
George O'Malley / George O'Malley (PVM): Schedule a paracentesis.

287
00:13:22,774 --> 00:13:23,134
Dr. Miranda Bailey / George O'Malley (PVM): Reason?

288
00:13:23,575 --> 00:13:25,437
Alex Karev / George O'Malley (PVM): Draining the fluid will relieve the pressure from the lungs.

289
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:25,557
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Good.

290
00:13:26,017 --> 00:13:26,998
Dr. Miranda Bailey: But don't schedule it.

291
00:13:27,018 --> 00:13:27,739
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Do it.

292
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,701
George O'Malley / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR George O'Malley (PVM): You want us to do the procedure?

293
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:30,844
Alex Karev / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You've seen one, right?

294
00:13:31,024 --> 00:13:31,543
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Absolutely.

295
00:13:31,764 --> 00:13:34,567
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Well, now do one.

296
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:36,552
George O'Malley / Patricia OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I've never seen one.

297
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:38,114
Dr. Miranda Bailey: You're about to.

298
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,258
George O'Malley / George O'Malley (PVM): Oh, my god.

299
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,879
Alex Karev / George O'Malley (PVM): God, an ovary.

300
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:45,062
Alex Karev / George O'Malley (PVM): Kind of gives new meaning to the term metrosexual.

301
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:47,547
Olivia Harper: Hi, George.

302
00:13:48,168 --> 00:13:48,528
George O'Malley: Olivia.

303
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:49,889
Alex Karev: What am I, invisible?

304
00:13:50,812 --> 00:13:51,091
Olivia Harper: Alex.

305
00:13:52,312 --> 00:13:52,653
George O'Malley / George O'Malley (PVM): You go ahead.

306
00:13:52,673 --> 00:13:53,676
Alex Karev / George O'Malley (PVM): I'll catch up with you later.

307
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:09,408
Olivia Harper: About time I got you alone today.

308
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:10,753
George O'Malley: Olivia.

309
00:14:10,793 --> 00:14:12,173
Olivia Harper: What time is your shift done?

310
00:14:12,195 --> 00:14:12,615
George O'Malley: Olivia.

311
00:14:12,716 --> 00:14:15,442
Olivia Harper: Because mine's over at 8, and I thought maybe you could come over.

312
00:14:15,461 --> 00:14:17,125
George O'Malley: Olivia, I need to tell you something.

313
00:14:17,144 --> 00:14:17,644
Olivia Harper: What's wrong?

314
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,711
Olivia Harper: You're breaking up with me?

315
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:21,452
George O'Malley: What?

316
00:14:21,474 --> 00:14:21,673
George / George O'Malley (PVM): No.

317
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:23,378
Olivia / George O'Malley (PVM): Oh, no, really.

318
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:24,860
George / George O'Malley (PVM): No, it's just.

319
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:31,451
George O'Malley: Okay, you're the only person that I've been with in a long time.

320
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:34,720
George O'Malley: I mean, not unusually long or anything.

321
00:14:35,302 --> 00:14:37,147
George O'Malley: Just a normal amount of a long time.

322
00:14:37,548 --> 00:14:41,278
George O'Malley: But it wouldn't matter to me if you've been with someone else.

323
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,139
George O'Malley: Maybe you have.

324
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:48,341
George O'Malley: I'm not accusing you of anything or judging you or handing out scarlet letters or anything.

325
00:14:48,844 --> 00:14:50,807
George O'Malley: You're a woman.

326
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,629
George O'Malley: A very attractive woman.

327
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:55,673
George O'Malley: Of course, you've been with other men.

328
00:14:55,735 --> 00:14:57,836
George O'Malley: Not that you've been with a lot of men.

329
00:14:57,918 --> 00:14:59,581
George O'Malley: It's not like you're a prostitute.

330
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:00,322
Olivia / Miss Henry OR George O'Malley OR George O'Malley (PVM): Prostitute?

331
00:15:00,341 --> 00:15:03,706
George O'Malley: No, not a prostitute.

332
00:15:03,725 --> 00:15:05,889
George O'Malley: No, opposite of a prostitute.

333
00:15:05,908 --> 00:15:07,032
George O'Malley: A lady.

334
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,336
George O'Malley: You're very ladylike.

335
00:15:09,397 --> 00:15:13,484
George / Olivia Harper OR George O'Malley (PVM): I mean, you're very bendy, but... George, breathe.

336
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:13,605
Olivia / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Okay.

337
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:17,471
George O'Malley: It's just, okay, here's the... I really like you, Olivia.

338
00:15:18,854 --> 00:15:19,634
George O'Malley: I like you a lot.

339
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:21,879
Olivia: Well, I like you too.

340
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:28,091
Olivia: I have syphilis.

341
00:16:02,985 --> 00:16:03,947
Dr. Burke / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You dropped a retractor.

342
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:05,849
Other Doctor / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Fine.

343
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:12,316
Dr. Preston Burke: A few weeks ago, I was operating, and a vision in my right eye became blurry.

344
00:16:12,336 --> 00:16:14,076
Dr. Preston Burke: After a few hours, it was fine.

345
00:16:14,096 --> 00:16:14,836
Dr. Preston Burke: It's come back again.

346
00:16:15,077 --> 00:16:15,937
Other Doctor: Did you have it checked out?

347
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,721
Dr. Preston Burke: Examination was normal.

348
00:16:18,162 --> 00:16:20,322
Dr. Preston Burke: My ophthalmologist tells me I'm just getting older.

349
00:16:21,683 --> 00:16:24,128
Dr. Preston Burke: But do you know what a decline in my visual acuity can mean?

350
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:26,048
Other Doctor: I'll set up some tests.

351
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,032
George / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Sure.

352
00:16:29,277 --> 00:16:30,899
Izzie / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): I know how the rumor mill runs around here.

353
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,421
George / Patient (Tumor Case) OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Let's just keep this to ourselves.

354
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,221
Izzie / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Absolutely.

355
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:43,711
George / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Olivia Harper OR Other Doctor (PVM): Yeah.

356
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,072
George / George O'Malley (PVM): Do you think she's talking about me?

357
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:46,932
Alex / George O'Malley (PVM): She's absolutely talking about you.

358
00:16:48,495 --> 00:16:49,437
Alex / George O'Malley (PVM): Dude, that's a good thing.

359
00:16:49,495 --> 00:16:49,817
George O'Malley: No.

360
00:16:50,157 --> 00:16:51,238
George O'Malley: No, it's not.

361
00:16:51,258 --> 00:16:52,538
Alex / George O'Malley (PVM): Georgia, get a clue.

362
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:55,581
Alex / George O'Malley (PVM): Syphilis is the best thing that ever happened to you.

363
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:57,124
Alex / George O'Malley (PVM): In their eyes, you're a player.

364
00:17:00,158 --> 00:17:00,957
Cristina / George O'Malley (PVM): Hey, Sif boy.

365
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:02,860
George O'Malley: You told her?

366
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:04,221
Izzie / George O'Malley (PVM): Just Christina.

367
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,383
Cristina / George O'Malley (PVM): Sif boy.

368
00:17:05,403 --> 00:17:06,324
Cristina / George O'Malley (PVM): It's got a nice ring to it.

369
00:17:06,423 --> 00:17:09,226
Cristina / George O'Malley OR George O'Malley (PVM): Kind of like Superboy, only diseased.

370
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:10,665
Meredith / George O'Malley (PVM): Izzy didn't have to say a word.

371
00:17:10,748 --> 00:17:14,029
Meredith / George O'Malley (PVM): Around here, the only thing that spreads faster than disease is gossip.

372
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:14,730
George O'Malley: It's not true.

373
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:17,814
George / Dr. Meredith Gray OR George O'Malley OR George O'Malley (PVM): Just because Izzy can't keep her mouth shut doesn't mean everyone knows.

374
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:18,493
Nurse Olivia / Dr. Meredith Gray OR George O'Malley (PVM): Hey, George.

375
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:19,934
Nurse Olivia / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): How are you feeling?

376
00:17:19,954 --> 00:17:21,135
Nurse Olivia / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Sorry about the syphilis.

377
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:25,601
George O'Malley: Everybody in this hospital knows.

378
00:17:25,621 --> 00:17:26,842
Alex / George O'Malley (PVM): Knows you're a player.

379
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,241
George O'Malley: You're disturbed.

380
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:28,982
Cristina / George O'Malley (PVM): True.

381
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:31,188
Meredith / George O'Malley (PVM): Everybody's got a secret.

382
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,029
Meredith / George O'Malley OR George O'Malley (PVM): Just be glad yours is out in the open.

383
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:33,490
George O'Malley: Oh, yeah?

384
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:34,432
George O'Malley: Alex, what's yours?

385
00:17:35,192 --> 00:17:36,394
Alex Karev: Show me yours, and I'll show you mine.

386
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:43,983
Cristina Yang / George O'Malley (PVM): I bet you've got some seriously kinky skeletons in your closet.

387
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:45,807
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): What's in my closet is none of your business.

388
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:47,951
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Well, I don't have any secrets.

389
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:48,872
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): My life is boring.

390
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:51,173
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Everybody's got something to hide.

391
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:02,574
Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Well, the mass we found is not a tumor.

392
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:04,036
Patient (Shane Herman) / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Well, that's good, right?

393
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:05,538
Patient (Shane Herman) / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Everything's got to be better than cancer.

394
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:07,338
Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Well, that's where it gets a little tricky.

395
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:16,510
Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): The chromosomal tests have revealed that your body contains DNA from two different embryos that merged in the womb at the very beginning of development.

396
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:20,856
Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): In rare cases, such as yours, the condition can produce gonadal hermaphroditism.

397
00:18:22,598 --> 00:18:24,162
Patient (Shane Herman) / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): I'm hearing scary words here, Preston.

398
00:18:24,182 --> 00:18:25,423
Patient (Shane Herman) / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): You know, pay cable kind of words.

399
00:18:25,864 --> 00:18:29,008
Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): In English, the mass on your bladder is an ovary.

400
00:18:30,507 --> 00:18:31,867
Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Don't worry, we're going to remove it.

401
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,496
Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): We have an excellent gynecological surgeon on staff.

402
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:38,897
Shane Herman: You're telling me I'm a guy with an ovary?

403
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,060
George O'Malley / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): It's simply a quirk of nature, man.

404
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:49,054
Shane Herman: What am I going to tell Holly?

405
00:18:49,452 --> 00:18:50,414
George O'Malley / Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): I bet you're going to be fine.

406
00:18:51,978 --> 00:18:52,919
Shane Herman: I'm still a man, right?

407
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,461
Shane Herman: A man's man, a Kappa man.

408
00:18:56,324 --> 00:18:56,785
Shane Herman: I mean.

409
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:58,853
Shane Herman: You know, my sex life.

410
00:18:59,692 --> 00:19:00,775
George O'Malley / Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): You been having any problems?

411
00:19:02,258 --> 00:19:07,183
Shane Herman: Was it my very pregnant wife that gave it away?

412
00:19:07,203 --> 00:19:07,704
George O'Malley / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Come on, man.

413
00:19:07,726 --> 00:19:08,125
George O'Malley / Other Doctor (PVM): Don't worry.

414
00:19:09,326 --> 00:19:10,107
George O'Malley / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): You never knew it was there.

415
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,111
George O'Malley / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): You won't miss it when it's gone.

416
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:17,641
George O'Malley / Dr. Preston Burke OR George O'Malley (PVM): Are you sure you know what you're doing?

417
00:19:17,661 --> 00:19:18,961
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): It's a shot of penicillin, George.

418
00:19:19,021 --> 00:19:20,285
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): Be grateful I'm even doing this.

419
00:19:20,305 --> 00:19:22,468
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): I've already seen more of you than I ever wanted to.

420
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:24,280
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley OR George O'Malley (PVM): I'll be fighting nightmares for a week.

421
00:19:24,303 --> 00:19:24,843
George O'Malley / George O'Malley (PVM): OK, you know what?

422
00:19:24,883 --> 00:19:25,324
George O'Malley / George O'Malley OR George O'Malley (PVM): Forget this.

423
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:26,727
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): Do you want to get rid of the CIF or not?

424
00:19:27,406 --> 00:19:32,174
Cristina Yang / George O'Malley (PVM): Just shut up and drop them.

425
00:19:32,194 --> 00:19:34,057
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I can't believe this.

426
00:19:34,077 --> 00:19:35,121
George O'Malley: Meredith, go away!

427
00:19:36,082 --> 00:19:38,625
Dr. Meredith Gray: Oh, George, I thought you could use some moral support.

428
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,328
George O'Malley: No, no moral support.

429
00:19:40,911 --> 00:19:42,313
George O'Malley: I'm indisposed here.

430
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:44,903
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): George, it's not a big deal.

431
00:19:44,962 --> 00:19:47,208
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): And you have a cute butt.

432
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,528
Alex Karev / Dr. Meredith Gray OR George O'Malley (PVM): I have a cute butt, too.

433
00:19:48,548 --> 00:19:49,329

434
00:19:49,351 --> 00:19:50,112
George O'Malley: Oh, get out.

435
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:51,074
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You're doing it wrong.

436
00:19:51,094 --> 00:19:52,075
George O'Malley: Be my guest.

437
00:19:52,736 --> 00:19:53,336

438
00:19:53,355 --> 00:19:53,677
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray OR George O'Malley (PVM): Alex!

439
00:19:54,557 --> 00:19:59,425
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray OR George O'Malley (PVM): Alex!

440
00:19:59,445 --> 00:19:59,645
Alex Karev: Hey!

441
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:01,348
Alex Karev / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): What are we doing here?

442
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:03,692
Cristina Yang / George O'Malley OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Breaking George's spirit.

443
00:20:03,712 --> 00:20:05,194
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Caring George's Sith.

444
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,038
George O'Malley: I don't like needles.

445
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,682
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Good thing you became a doctor.

446
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:09,603
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Other side.

447
00:20:10,284 --> 00:20:10,565
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Izzy?

448
00:20:10,805 --> 00:20:11,125
Dr. Isobel Stevens: Yeah?

00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:34,675
Derek Shepherd / George O'Malley (PVM): You know, I've spent hours, days, years imagining myself half naked in a room with three women.

457
00:20:35,751 --> 00:20:37,134

465
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,113

466
00:20:57,094 --> 00:21:00,856
Meredith Grey / Miss Henry (PVM): You have to understand, I'm a surgical intern, so my time isn't my own.

467
00:21:01,538 --> 00:21:03,460
Miss Henry: Our residents really respond to these events.

468
00:21:03,618 --> 00:21:05,320
Miss Henry: They always enjoy themselves.

469
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,471

476
00:21:18,382 --> 00:21:21,105

487
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:04,958

488
00:22:05,088 --> 00:22:16,083
Patricia: When the time is right, and gentlemen, you'll all know when that time is, carefully open the condom packet and roll it onto the banana.

491
00:22:20,528 --> 00:22:23,152

495
00:22:33,237 --> 00:22:35,661

502
00:22:56,135 --> 00:23:02,689

503
00:23:02,709 --> 00:23:06,576

507
00:23:22,173 --> 00:23:27,161

508
00:23:27,882 --> 00:23:29,364

509
00:23:29,564 --> 00:23:29,923

512
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:37,432

513
00:23:37,452 --> 00:23:38,634
Olivia Harper / Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. Meredith Gray OR George O'Malley (PVM): You don't need to be in this line.

514
00:23:38,775 --> 00:23:39,454

515
00:23:40,896 --> 00:23:43,961
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray OR George O'Malley (PVM): There's no one else.

516
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,365

517
00:23:48,144 --> 00:23:49,448
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Nothing surprises me.

518
00:23:52,094 --> 00:23:55,538

526
00:24:06,056 --> 00:24:07,038

527
00:24:07,057 --> 00:24:09,000

528
00:24:09,401 --> 00:24:13,646
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR George O'Malley OR George O'Malley (PVM): That's the one good thing about the fact neither of us is getting any, right?

529
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:19,958
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Alex Karev OR George O'Malley (PVM): Mr. Franklin, we've given you a local anesthetic, but you might feel some pressure.

530
00:24:23,701 --> 00:24:24,201
Mr. Franklin: Okay.

531
00:24:25,983 --> 00:24:26,346

533
00:24:32,134 --> 00:24:35,182
Meredith Grey / Miss Henry OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Are you in the peritoneal cavity?

534
00:24:38,906 --> 00:24:40,790
Cristina Yang / Miss Henry OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): The fluid is bloody.

535
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:41,813
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Is it supposed to be bloody?

536
00:24:41,853 --> 00:24:43,557
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You've done this before, right?

537
00:24:43,855 --> 00:24:44,298
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Alex Karev (PVM): Of course.

538
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:45,480

539
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:48,325
Meredith Grey / Alex Karev (PVM): You're doing great, Mr. Franklin.

540
00:24:51,762 --> 00:24:52,565
Mr. Franklin: Good.

541
00:24:52,644 --> 00:25:02,579
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Meredith Gray OR George O'Malley (PVM): Now all we have to do is wait.

542
00:25:08,711 --> 00:25:09,652
Derek Shepherd / Other Doctor (PVM): You see that right there?

543
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:10,394
Patient (Tumor Case): Mm-hmm.

544
00:25:11,413 --> 00:25:11,976
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): It's a tumor.

545
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:14,881
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): And it's pressing against your optic nerve.

546
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:15,682
Patient (Tumor Case): Is it operable?

547
00:25:15,701 --> 00:25:16,303
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Oh, definitely.

548
00:25:18,207 --> 00:25:19,989
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You know, it does have its risks.

549
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:21,951
Patient (Tumor Case): You mean I could lose my sight?

550
00:25:22,892 --> 00:25:23,030
Derek Shepherd / Patient (Tumor Case) (PVM): Mm-hmm.

551
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:23,751
Patient (Tumor Case): So that's what I need.

552
00:25:24,153 --> 00:25:25,755
Patient (Tumor Case): A syphilis outbreak and a tumor.

553
00:25:26,076 --> 00:25:27,096
Derek Shepherd / Other Doctor (PVM): Well, it's probably unrelated.

554
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,118
Miranda Bailey / Patient (Tumor Case) (PVM): All right, Derek.

555
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,021
Miranda Bailey / Patient (Tumor Case) (PVM): Let's see how good you really are.

556
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:34,525

557
00:25:34,545 --> 00:25:35,665

558
00:25:35,685 --> 00:25:36,567
Derek Shepherd: All my people only.

559
00:25:37,366 --> 00:25:37,509
Miranda Bailey / Patient (Tumor Case) (PVM): Mm-hmm.

560
00:25:37,528 --> 00:25:38,848
Derek Shepherd: And I still want this kept under wraps.

561
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,790
Cristina Yang / Patient (Tumor Case) OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): The vultures will be circling soon enough.

562
00:25:41,011 --> 00:25:41,913
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Aren't I one of the vultures?

563
00:25:42,314 --> 00:25:44,615
Cristina Yang / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Why, do you think I want to keep an eye on you?

564
00:25:44,635 --> 00:25:45,076
Cristina Yang / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Get going.

565
00:25:45,438 --> 00:25:46,317

566
00:25:46,857 --> 00:25:47,640

567
00:25:53,932 --> 00:25:54,432

568
00:25:54,893 --> 00:25:56,895
Richard Webber / Other Doctor (PVM): Yeah, I need you to help me out on something for the chief.

569
00:25:57,636 --> 00:25:58,377
Richard Webber / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Other Doctor (PVM): Can you keep a secret?

570
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:00,300
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Better than you think.

571
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,087
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): How much fluid can one body hold?

572
00:26:05,107 --> 00:26:05,588
Cristina Yang / George O'Malley (PVM): Shh.

573
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,954
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): There's a lot of fluid in there, Mr. Franklin, but we're almost finished.

574
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:12,621
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): Mr. Franklin?

575
00:26:14,103 --> 00:26:14,541

576
00:26:16,905 --> 00:26:17,468
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): Mr. Franklin?

577
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,309
Meredith Grey / George O'Malley OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): He has no pulse.

578
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:19,651
Izzie Stevens / Miss Henry (PVM): What?

579
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:20,833
Meredith Grey / George O'Malley (PVM): He has no pulse!

580
00:26:37,469 --> 00:26:39,951
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): How could he die just like that with no warning?

581
00:26:39,971 --> 00:26:41,714
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): There was blood in the tube when it first went in.

582
00:26:42,277 --> 00:26:42,939
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): What if it's our fault?

583
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:43,759
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): What if we did something wrong?

584
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:44,780
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): We didn't do anything wrong.

585
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,663

586
00:26:48,989 --> 00:26:49,871
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I checked your chart.

587
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,313

588
00:26:51,432 --> 00:26:52,173

589
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,237

590
00:26:53,557 --> 00:26:54,259
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You couldn't have known.

591
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:56,040
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): There was no history of heart problems.

592
00:26:56,362 --> 00:26:57,462
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): His death wasn't your fault.

593
00:26:58,045 --> 00:26:58,726

00:27:01,717 --> 00:27:03,239

00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:07,443
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): It's going down as cardiopulmonary arrest complicated by liver disease.

598
00:27:07,723 --> 00:27:12,490
Meredith Grey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): But an autopsy will... The family decided they didn't want an autopsy.

599
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,815
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): But, Dr. Bailey... They don't want an autopsy.

605
00:27:33,307 --> 00:27:34,647

606
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,912

607
00:27:36,951 --> 00:27:38,814

609
00:27:41,415 --> 00:27:44,519

610
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,922

611
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:47,041

613
00:27:48,963 --> 00:27:49,826

614
00:27:49,846 --> 00:27:50,086

615

616
00:27:53,868 --> 00:27:55,372

617
00:27:55,392 --> 00:27:57,272
Olivia Harper / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You tell me if I need to get tested, right?

618

619
00:27:59,615 --> 00:28:00,317

620
00:28:00,557 --> 00:28:02,597

621
00:28:02,637 --> 00:28:06,221
Olivia Harper / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Olivia Harper (PVM): I mean, we never said we have rules.

622
00:28:06,323 --> 00:28:08,285
Olivia Harper / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): And I wouldn't hold it against you.

623
00:28:08,463 --> 00:28:10,747
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): When would I have time to go out and get syphilis?

624
00:28:11,346 --> 00:28:12,489
Olivia Harper / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You're handful enough as it is.

625
00:28:12,548 --> 00:28:14,951
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): And besides, we're practically a condom ad.

626
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,153
Olivia Harper / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): But no more glow in the dark ones.

627
00:28:17,712 --> 00:28:19,174
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You see, there's nothing to worry about.

628
00:28:19,214 --> 00:28:23,200
Olivia Harper / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Olivia Harper (PVM): Maybe we should, you know, pick some walls, I mean.

629
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:23,558
George O'Malley / Olivia Harper (PVM): We should.

630
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:25,500
Olivia Harper / George O'Malley (PVM): OK.

631
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:25,740

634
00:28:42,102 --> 00:28:44,124

635
00:28:44,663 --> 00:28:47,287

636
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,309

Unknown / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Due in five weeks.

639
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:56,394

641
00:29:01,362 --> 00:29:01,981
Unknown / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Bill is sterile.

642
00:29:02,544 --> 00:29:03,403
Unknown / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): And always has been.

643
00:29:05,406 --> 00:29:06,950
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Then who got his wife pregnant?

644
00:29:10,996 --> 00:29:13,538
Unknown / Unknown (PVM): Oh.

645
00:29:13,617 --> 00:29:14,140
Unknown / Unknown (PVM): Oh.

646
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,760

647
00:29:16,063 --> 00:29:18,045
Unknown / George O'Malley (PVM): How's Burke going to tell him the baby's not his?

648
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,445

649
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:19,948
Unknown / George O'Malley (PVM): He has to.

650
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:20,528
Unknown / George O'Malley (PVM): They're friends.

651
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:21,871
Unknown / George O'Malley (PVM): Bill's better off not knowing.

652
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:23,731

653
00:29:23,751 --> 00:29:24,452
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Maybe, maybe not.

654
00:29:24,535 --> 00:29:25,855
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Gray OR George O'Malley (PVM): I think Bill should know his wife's cheating on him.

655

656
00:29:27,586 --> 00:29:30,691

657
00:29:31,152 --> 00:29:32,972
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Sorry, sir.

658
00:29:32,992 --> 00:29:33,914
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You're such a gossip.

659
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:43,671
Unknown / George O'Malley (PVM): We know how confusing this must be, your husband dying so suddenly.

660
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,275
Unknown / Miss Henry OR George O'Malley (PVM): But an autopsy will tell us why.

661
00:29:47,415 --> 00:29:49,941
Unknown / Miss Henry (PVM): So you think we should do the autopsy?

662
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,884
Unknown / Miss Henry (PVM): No, we just want this to be over.

663
00:29:52,182 --> 00:29:54,807
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): But don't you want to know for certain what killed him?

664
00:29:56,069 --> 00:29:58,375
Unknown / Miss Henry (PVM): My father was a mean drunk who couldn't hold a job.

665
00:29:58,413 --> 00:30:00,198
Unknown / Miss Henry (PVM): That's what killed him.

666
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:05,826
Miss Henry / George O'Malley (PVM): I understand that you're angry, but knowing for sure might help give you some closure.

667
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:09,634
Miss Henry / Miss Henry OR George O'Malley (PVM): And it was awfully sudden, Alice.

668
00:30:09,653 --> 00:30:10,055
Alice / Miss Henry (PVM): Sudden?

669
00:30:11,217 --> 00:30:12,900
Alice / Miss Henry (PVM): He's been killing himself for years.

670
00:30:13,721 --> 00:30:14,721
Miss Henry / Miss Henry (PVM): He was a good man.

671
00:30:16,605 --> 00:30:17,708
Alice / Miss Henry (PVM): Maybe they're right.

672
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:19,651
Alice / Miss Henry (PVM): Maybe we should do the autopsy.

673
00:30:19,671 --> 00:30:21,775
Meredith Grey / Miss Henry (PVM): Mom, stop it.

674
00:30:21,923 --> 00:30:22,605

675
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:24,868
Meredith Grey / Miss Henry (PVM): It's finally over.

676
00:30:25,893 --> 00:30:28,597
Miss Henry / Miss Henry (PVM): Alice, your father would have wanted to.

677
00:30:28,699 --> 00:30:29,961
Alice / Miss Henry (PVM): Who cares what he wanted?

678
00:30:29,981 --> 00:30:36,336
Alice / Miss Henry (PVM): Can't we please just try and get out of this with whatever shred of dignity this family has left?

679
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:53,747
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You guys want to perform an unauthorized autopsy.

680
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,269
Meredith Grey / Alex Karev (PVM): I know you, Christina.

681
00:30:56,329 --> 00:30:58,574
Meredith Grey / Alex Karev (PVM): You do not want to be known as a new 007.

682
00:30:58,894 --> 00:31:00,115
Cristina Yang / Alex Karev (PVM): An autopsy clears your name.

683
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,961
Meredith Grey / Alex Karev OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Christina, no.

684
00:31:03,602 --> 00:31:04,501
Izzie Stevens / Alex Karev (PVM): What about Franklin's wife?

685
00:31:05,022 --> 00:31:06,444
Cristina Yang / Alex Karev (PVM): You saw the way she was looking at me.

686
00:31:06,486 --> 00:31:07,728
Cristina Yang / Alex Karev (PVM): She wants the autopsy.

687
00:31:07,748 --> 00:31:09,009
Cristina Yang / Alex Karev (PVM): She just didn't want to fight with her daughter.

688
00:31:09,048 --> 00:31:10,332
Izzie Stevens / Alex Karev (PVM): She looks so sad.

689
00:31:10,372 --> 00:31:14,678
Meredith Grey / George O'Malley (PVM): Okay, Christina Yang, license to kill.

690
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,373
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Okay, I'm in.

691
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,717
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I am so not involved in this.

692
00:31:21,957 --> 00:31:23,117
Cristina Yang / Alex Karev (PVM): Meredith, this is Fight Club.

693
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:24,181
Cristina Yang / Alex Karev (PVM): Nobody talks about it.

694
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:24,800
Meredith Grey / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Fine.

695
00:31:26,001 --> 00:31:27,243
Cristina Yang / Alex Karev (PVM): We have to do it when Bailey's not around.

696
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:28,185
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Bailey's always around.

697
00:31:28,227 --> 00:31:29,469
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): She's everywhere and knows everything.

698
00:31:29,647 --> 00:31:30,769
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Well, we have to take our chances.

699
00:31:31,412 --> 00:31:33,914
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Bailey's got something tonight from 7 to 11.

700
00:31:33,954 --> 00:31:35,699
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You two will be the last thing she's worried about.

701
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:36,538
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): How do you know that?

702
00:31:36,701 --> 00:31:37,382
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): What kind of something?

703
00:31:38,323 --> 00:31:39,505
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Oh, I can't tell you that.

704
00:31:39,785 --> 00:31:40,767
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): It's Fight Club 2.

705
00:31:43,884 --> 00:31:54,842
Dr. Bailey / Alex Karev OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): If I'm missing out on a real patient because of this, they're going to call me 007 because I've killed you.

706
00:31:57,065 --> 00:31:57,526
Dr. Bailey / Other Doctor (PVM): How we doing?

707
00:31:57,967 --> 00:31:58,886
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Did you lock up the gallery?

708
00:31:59,509 --> 00:31:59,847
Cristina Yang / Other Doctor (PVM): Don't worry.

709
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:00,871
Cristina Yang / Other Doctor (PVM): We're flying under the radar.

710
00:32:01,131 --> 00:32:02,413
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): What did you put out there?

711
00:32:02,432 --> 00:32:03,114
Cristina Yang / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): The Midas Rex?

712
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:04,836
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): We've got it, Chief.

713
00:32:04,855 --> 00:32:06,077
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): How much vancomycin is there?

714
00:32:06,228 --> 00:32:07,809
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): One gram is ordered, sir.

715
00:32:07,951 --> 00:32:10,095
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): You're not going to be too liberal with those benzos, are you?

716
00:32:10,515 --> 00:32:12,356
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You know, doctors make the worst patients.

717
00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:14,320
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Why don't you just breathe in the happy gas?

718
00:32:14,662 --> 00:32:16,025
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Stop running my OR.

719
00:32:18,268 --> 00:32:18,387
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Ready?

720
00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:19,130
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I got you covered.

721
00:32:28,726 --> 00:32:29,365
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): We stole a body.

722
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,250
Cristina Yang / George O'Malley (PVM): We're body snatchers.

723
00:32:33,108 --> 00:32:34,932
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray OR George O'Malley (PVM): What if somebody from the morgue comes looking for Franklin?

724
00:32:35,132 --> 00:32:40,238
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray OR George O'Malley (PVM): Well, A, it's in the middle of the night, and B, the thing about being dead is people stop looking for you.

725
00:32:44,182 --> 00:32:44,241
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): OK.

726
00:32:44,261 --> 00:32:45,564
Cristina Yang / George O'Malley (PVM): When's the last time you did an autopsy?

727
00:32:45,943 --> 00:32:47,487
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): I took gross anatomy just like you.

728
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,406
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): I'm just trying to remember.

729
00:32:48,846 --> 00:32:49,509
Cristina Yang / George O'Malley (PVM): You know how to hold on.

730
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:49,867
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): Hold on.

731
00:32:49,929 --> 00:32:50,210
Cristina Yang / George O'Malley (PVM): Wait.

732
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,211
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): Hold on.

733
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:53,834
Cristina Yang / George O'Malley (PVM): You brought a textbook?

734
00:32:54,493 --> 00:32:56,635
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): Uh, if we're going to do this, we're going to do it right.

735
00:33:05,054 --> 00:33:05,653
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): OK, got it.

736
00:33:06,173 --> 00:33:06,454
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You sure?

737
00:33:06,496 --> 00:33:08,678

752
00:33:42,806 --> 00:33:46,310
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): If it is, when he wakes up, he'll be blind.

755
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:54,285

775
00:34:49,496 --> 00:34:51,458

777
00:34:55,081 --> 00:34:56,181

778
00:34:56,402 --> 00:34:57,625
Dr. Preston Burke: Because Bill is my best friend.

779
00:34:57,643 --> 00:34:58,105
Dr. Preston Burke: That's why.

780
00:34:58,166 --> 00:34:59,246

787
00:35:08,161 --> 00:35:09,282

789
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:15,650
Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): Fine.

790
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,135
Dr. Preston Burke: Maybe his friend wouldn't tell him the truth.

791
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:31,070
Dr. Preston Burke: But I'm also his doctor, and his doctor is not going to lie to him.

00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,351

Dr. Meredith Gray: And besides, she doesn't even know who I am anyway, so.

798
00:35:46,675 --> 00:35:48,157
Miss Henry / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Miss Henry OR Miss Henry (PVM): Today she did.

799
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:49,860
Dr. Meredith Gray: What?

800
00:35:50,802 --> 00:35:53,646

00:36:22,202 --> 00:36:24,125

809
00:36:25,887 --> 00:36:26,168

810
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:29,371

816
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:05,356
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Don't even tell me you're doing what I think you're doing.

817
00:37:10,264 --> 00:37:21,237
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Miranda Bailey OR George O'Malley (PVM): Not only did you disregard the family's wishes, you broke the law.

818
00:37:21,257 --> 00:37:23,159
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You could be arrested for assault.

819
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:24,581

838
00:38:14,322 --> 00:38:14,902

840
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:22,155
Unknown (likely a doctor, possibly Izzie Stevens or Cristina Yang) / Olivia Harper OR Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): I'm going to tell you what your mother would say if she were here.

841
00:38:24,418 --> 00:38:26,742
Unknown (likely a doctor, possibly Izzie Stevens or Cristina Yang) / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): You're making a mistake, a big one.

842
00:38:29,487 --> 00:38:31,469
Unknown (likely Alice or her mother) / Olivia Harper (PVM): And I would tell my mother it's not a mistake.

850
00:38:51,335 --> 00:38:58,387

Unknown (likely a family member, possibly Alice's mother) / Miss Henry OR Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): But I thought he was always so sick because of the drinking.

00:39:08,864 --> 00:39:10,266

858
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:16,295

Unknown (likely a doctor, possibly Izzie Stevens or Cristina Yang) / George O'Malley OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Dr. Stevens and Dr. Yang may have saved your life.

861
00:39:31,835 --> 00:39:33,097
Unknown (likely a doctor, possibly Izzie Stevens or Cristina Yang) / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Just a formality.

862
00:39:38,596 --> 00:39:43,820
Dr. Meredith Gray: forget is how good it can feel when you finally set secrets free.

863
00:39:47,244 --> 00:39:53,972
Dr. Meredith Gray: Whether good or bad, at least they're out in the open, like it or not.

864
00:40:00,018 --> 00:40:02,159
Unknown (likely Izzie Stevens) / George O'Malley (PVM): But I'll find a way.

865
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:02,780

870
00:40:20,909 --> 00:40:23,231
Callie Torres / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): And when I realized, I broke it off with the other guy.

871
00:40:23,251 --> 00:40:23,952
George O'Malley: The other guy?

872
00:40:26,556 --> 00:40:27,217
