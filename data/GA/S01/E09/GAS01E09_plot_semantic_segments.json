Izzie tells George he does not need to be ashamed, thinking George was masturbating. Meredith walks out and wonders why George and Izzie are arguing. Izzie explains to Meredith that Izzie caught George \"playing with Jimmy and the twins.\" George, Izzie, and Meredith walk away. Derek comes out with Derek's phone ringing but ignores the call. **Segment 3:**",
  "Cristina talks to a doctor about Cristina's abortion scheduled for the 16th. Cristina hangs up when Burke comes around the corner. Burke asks Cristina why Cristina did not answer Burke's page the night before. Cristina thinks about telling Burke Cristina is pregnant but decides not to and walks away. **Segment 4:**",
  "Webber walks past Cristina, swaying and rubbing Webber's head. George talks quietly to Olivia in a corner as Webber passes and asks Olivia if Olivia feels okay. George starts to tell Olivia that George feels itchy, but Izzie interrupts George and Olivia. George and Olivia leave together. Izzie realizes that George was not masturbating and looks confused, wondering what George was really doing. **Segment 5:**",
  "In the locker room, George asks Alex to look at George's rash because George cannot see it well. Alex kneels down, examines George's penis, pats George on the shoulder, tells George he has syphilis, and walks away. **Segment 6:**",
  "Burke, Alex, and George treat a patient by inserting a camera into the patient's penis. The patient, Bill, is a friend of Burke's. Burke tells Alex and George to focus only on the baby in Bill's wife's uterus. Burke, Alex, and George finish the procedure and schedule a CT scan. **Segment 7:**",
  "In another operating room, Meredith helps Webber and Bailey with surgery. Meredith looks up at Derek in the gallery with worry. Bailey and Meredith are worried about Webber as Webber complains about the lighting, but Bailey and Meredith continue the surgery. Cristina and Izzie examine a patient with a very large abdomen. The patient explains that the patient's abdomen has been growing for a while. George asks for the bloodwork of George O'Malley. Izzie takes the results from George and asks who has syphilis and why George has the bloodwork if it is not surgical. George pulls Izzie into a room and closes the shades. Izzie teases George but tries to reassure George that a few doses of penicillin will cure the syphilis. **Segment 8:**",
  "During surgery, Webber drops a surgical instrument and blinks rapidly. Webber steps back and lets Bailey finish the operation. **Segment 9:**",
  "After getting the CT results and discussing George's penis, Alex and George go to find Burke. Cristina and Izzie go into Franklin's room and tell Franklin that Franklin has ascites. Franklin and Franklin's wife look worried. Franklin's daughter seems uninterested and says it is because Franklin drinks a lot. **Segment 10:**",
  "While looking at the results, Alex and Burke argue about what something looks like on the scan. Alex jokes that it looks like an ovary. George enters the room and gives Burke some test results. Burke is surprised when Burke learns the mass is actually an ovary. **Segment 11:**",
  "Cristina and Izzie inform Bailey about Franklin. After testing Franklin, Bailey tells Cristina and Izzie they can perform a paracentesis. Cristina and Izzie celebrate as Bailey walks away. **Segment 12:**",
  "Alex and George walk down the stairs together. George kisses Olivia. Alex waits but is ignored, so Alex leaves. **Segment 13:**",
  "While George and Olivia are kissing, George pulls away. George tries to talk to Olivia. Olivia becomes worried and asks if George is breaking up with Olivia. George assures Olivia that George is not. After struggling to explain, George finally tells Olivia that George has syphilis. Olivia is shocked and quickly walks away. **Segment 14:**",

  "Alex and George walk outside with Alex's and George's lunch trays. Alex and George pass Olivia, who ignores George. Alex and George sit with Cristina, Izzie, and Meredith. George is surprised to find out that Cristina, Izzie, and Meredith know about George's syphilis. Alex tells George that Cristina, Izzie, and Meredith will now think George is a \"player.\" --- **Analysis and Corrections:** - **Segment 7** is problematic. It contains multiple locations and events: - Meredith in surgery with Webber and Bailey - Cristina and Izzie examining a patient - George and Izzie discussing bloodwork and syphilis These are separate scenes by location and focus. - **Segment 9** is also problematic. It contains two separate events: - Alex and George go to find Burke after getting CT results - Cristina and Izzie go into Franklin's room and talk to Franklin and his family These are separate scenes by character focus and location. **All other segments are valid.** --- **Corrected Segments:**",
