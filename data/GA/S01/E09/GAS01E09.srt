1
00:00:00,216 --> 00:00:02,124
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,225
How hot is the sex?

3
00:00:03,275 --> 00:00:04,914
Some people would call this a relationship.

4
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:07,489
It's just that I hardly know anything about you.

5
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:10,311
We're having sex every night. I think I deserve details.

6
00:00:10,357 --> 00:00:11,484
You have more details than most.

7
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:13,895
What makes a hotshot doc leave the big apple for Seattle?

8
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:15,063
Thanks for the coffee.

9
00:00:18,774 --> 00:00:20,428
Adoption? Keeping the baby?

10
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:22,057
I know this is a difficult decision.

11
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:22,791
I'm not interested.

12
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,042
I am not your sister!

13
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:25,850
I am a man!

14
00:00:25,938 --> 00:00:26,869
You need to get laid.

15
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:27,960
See that nurse over there?

16
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:30,781
She's single. She's got red hair. Go ask her out.

17
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:32,389
Smooth moves, doctor.

18
00:00:33,182 --> 00:00:34,031
Who is that?

19
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:34,820
That's dad.

20
00:00:34,898 --> 00:00:36,085
What's her diagnosis?

21
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:37,012
Alzheimer's.

22
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:39,055
She doesn't want anyone to know.

23
00:00:39,161 --> 00:00:41,431
I'm the only person she'll allow to see her.

24
00:00:47,268 --> 00:00:49,767
Secrets can't hide in science.

25
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,217
Medicine has a way of exposing the lies.

26
00:00:54,236 --> 00:00:58,638
Within the walls of the hospital, the truth is stripped bare.

27
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:02,141
How we keep our secrets outside the hospital --

28
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,664
well, that's a little different.

29
00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:13,181
George. You locked the door. I need to take a shower.

30
00:01:13,247 --> 00:01:15,141
Uh, uh, I'll be out in a minute.

31
00:01:16,164 --> 00:01:17,174
What are you doing in there?

32
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:18,335
It's private.

33
00:01:19,548 --> 00:01:22,140
Oh. Oh, god. I'm sorry. I get it.

34
00:01:22,257 --> 00:01:23,690
I don't mean to interrupt.

35
00:01:23,815 --> 00:01:25,058
No, it's not that!

36
00:01:25,324 --> 00:01:26,829
It's okay. Take your time.

37
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:29,672
I am not doing what you think I'm doing.

38
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:34,125
There's really no need to explain. I'll wait. You just... finish.

39
00:01:34,202 --> 00:01:36,763
No, I'm -- I'm coming. I'm coming out!

40
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:38,585
One thing is certain.

41
00:01:39,093 --> 00:01:40,997
Whatever it is we're trying to hide,

42
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,833
we're never ready for that moment when the truth gets naked.

43
00:01:45,903 --> 00:01:49,378
Dr. Grey, this is Ms. Henry from the nursing home.

44
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,925
I'm calling about your mother.

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,882
Is she all right?

46
00:01:51,943 --> 00:01:53,341
Oh, it's nothing like that.

47
00:01:53,418 --> 00:01:54,821
Can I call you later then?

48
00:01:54,902 --> 00:01:57,187
- Uh, I just wanted to -- 
- I have to go.

49
00:01:59,556 --> 00:02:02,917
Oh, my god. Who is calling you at this hour?

50
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:04,688
It's a wrong number.

51
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:13,606
There's no reason to be ashamed. It's normal, healthy even.

52
00:02:13,704 --> 00:02:16,228
I'm not ashamed 'cause I wasn't doing anything.

53
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:18,455
I don't have to. I have a girlfriend.

54
00:02:18,665 --> 00:02:20,299
An imaginary girlfriend?

55
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:23,324
An actual girlfriend.

56
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:24,946
You know what? It's no big deal.

57
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:26,771
You don't have to lie. I get it.

58
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:27,876
You have needs.

59
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:32,019
What is going on out here?

60
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,714
Nothing.

61
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:34,718
Nothing.

62
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:36,059
Nothing.

63
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:40,559
He's freaked out 'cause I caught him playing with little jimmy and the twins.

64
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:41,710
I have girlfriend.

65
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,934
Okay.

66
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:48,639
This sounds like fun out here.

67
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,145
Aren't you gonna get that? It might be the hospital.

68
00:02:56,273 --> 00:02:58,110
It's not. Breakfast?

69
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,041
That's the problem with secrets --

70
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:06,667
like misery, they love company.

71
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:10,753
No, look, I told you people -- I'm not coming in for a counseling session.

72
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:12,671
I know all my options.

73
00:03:13,179 --> 00:03:17,647
Uh, well, I made my decision,and I made my appointment.

74
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,275
I'll be there on the 16th.

75
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:23,711
They pile up and up until they take over everything...

76
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:24,929
I paged you last night.

77
00:03:25,322 --> 00:03:26,402
I wasn't on call.

78
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,885
That's not why I paged you.

79
00:03:32,204 --> 00:03:33,669
You could give me your home number.

80
00:03:36,464 --> 00:03:37,683
Um, Burke...

81
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:42,736
Uh, I gotta go.

82
00:03:43,335 --> 00:03:45,639
...Until you don't have room for anything else...

83
00:03:50,928 --> 00:03:55,956
...until you're so full of secrets, you feel like you're going to burst.

84
00:03:56,121 --> 00:03:58,102
I had a really good time the other night.

85
00:03:58,152 --> 00:03:58,991
Yeah, me too.

86
00:03:59,662 --> 00:04:02,128
Are you, uh, feeling okay and everything?

87
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,036
I'm good.

88
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:06,062
Great, now that I got to see you. Why?

89
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:08,418
Oh, no reason. I'm good, too, you know?

90
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:09,672
Really good.

91
00:04:10,338 --> 00:04:11,085
You know.

92
00:04:12,094 --> 00:04:14,746
But um... a little itchy.

93
00:04:14,907 --> 00:04:15,505
George.

94
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:16,969
Hey.

95
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:17,763
Olivia.

96
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,232
Hi, Dr. Stevens.

97
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:21,336
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

98
00:04:22,354 --> 00:04:23,046
Bye.

99
00:04:27,695 --> 00:04:28,402
Y eah.

100
00:04:29,386 --> 00:04:30,239
She's into me.

101
00:04:31,044 --> 00:04:33,185
Way to go, George. She's cute.

102
00:04:33,865 --> 00:04:35,923
So, this morning, you really weren't...

103
00:04:36,112 --> 00:04:38,421
Anytime you want to apologize.

104
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,802
Then what were you doing in the bathroom for so long?

105
00:04:42,328 --> 00:04:43,255
I have to go.

106
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:04,083
I know I'm pretty to look at and all, George, but back up.

107
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:06,167
I need to ask you something.

108
00:05:06,652 --> 00:05:07,651
I'm waiting.

109
00:05:08,148 --> 00:05:14,892
I seem to be having this skin... thing going on, like a rash, really,

110
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:19,356
and I think I know what it is, but I can't get close enough to tell for sure.

111
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:20,227
Let's  see it.

112
00:05:20,974 --> 00:05:24,864
It's kind of located in an, um, you know, private --

113
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:28,634
You're a doctor, George. It's called a penis. You have a rash on your penis?

114
00:05:30,318 --> 00:05:31,817
I think I can describe it.

115
00:05:32,136 --> 00:05:34,660
Um, it's k-- red.

116
00:05:34,727 --> 00:05:37,614
Just come on. Just show me your junk so we can get this over with.

117
00:05:54,915 --> 00:05:55,652
So?

118
00:05:59,548 --> 00:06:01,488
Dude, you've got syphilis.

119
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:45,809
Once his work-up came back unrevealing, the urologist suggested a cystoscopy.

120
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,582
Reason?

121
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:49,402
To get a look inside the bladder.

122
00:06:49,495 --> 00:06:51,066
I appreciate you doing this, Preston.

123
00:06:51,932 --> 00:06:53,949
I know this is a little out of your field.

124
00:06:54,062 --> 00:06:54,989
That's not a problem.

125
00:06:55,102 --> 00:06:56,822
It gives my interns something to do.

126
00:06:57,456 --> 00:06:59,238
I have a feeling you keep them plenty busy.

127
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:01,250
We were in the same frat at tulane.

128
00:07:01,548 --> 00:07:05,353
It's gone from torturing pledges to torturing interns. Am I right?

129
00:07:05,423 --> 00:07:07,905
Be very careful how you two answer that.

130
00:07:09,412 --> 00:07:10,994
I could tell some stories.

131
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,288
Bill, you have a camera snaking up your mojo.

132
00:07:13,385 --> 00:07:14,583
It's not the time to cross me.

133
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:16,486
It isn't anything too serious?

134
00:07:16,872 --> 00:07:18,730
That's what this procedure will tell us.

135
00:07:19,135 --> 00:07:22,520
You don't worry about anything but growing my godson in there.

136
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,974
He kicks like you wouldn't believe.

137
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:25,508
A badass, just like his father.

138
00:07:26,923 --> 00:07:28,289
Move a little to the right.

139
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:29,845
Your other right.

140
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:31,366
There.

141
00:07:31,658 --> 00:07:32,852
What do you see? What is it?

142
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,227
Could be any number of things.

143
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,392
O'Malley, take a biopsy of the mass.

144
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,041
Dr. Karev, schedule a C.T.

145
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,692
Let's not worry until we have to.

146
00:07:49,858 --> 00:07:51,020
There's too much damage.

147
00:07:52,901 --> 00:07:56,751
We'll have to remove most of the colon instead of a local resection.

148
00:08:02,435 --> 00:08:03,407
You gotta push it up.

149
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:18,870
More suture. And what's with these damn lights in here?

150
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:30,784
Mr. Franklin, how long has your abdomen been like this?

151
00:08:31,174 --> 00:08:33,062
It's been getting bigger for a while.

152
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:35,274
I told him there was something wrong.

153
00:08:35,388 --> 00:08:38,372
No one gets fat like this so fast. I told him.

154
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,698
Everybody told him.

155
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,327
He has dullness to percussion and spider angiomas.

156
00:08:42,392 --> 00:08:43,446
What's all that mean?

157
00:08:43,544 --> 00:08:46,084
We have to run some tests.

158
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:47,414
Great.

159
00:08:47,676 --> 00:08:49,288
What's that gonna cost us this time?

160
00:08:49,482 --> 00:08:51,142
Alice, don't.

161
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:59,107
Hi, uh, results for George O'Malley?

162
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:03,349
I don't see it here. What's the patient's name?

163
00:09:03,403 --> 00:09:05,801
O'Malley, George. Look, it's just a simple blood test.

164
00:09:06,286 --> 00:09:07,034
Here you go.

165
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:08,165
Thank you.

166
00:09:15,293 --> 00:09:17,268
Franklin, Jordan. I need these back asap.

167
00:09:17,346 --> 00:09:18,318
What a shocker.

168
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:21,273
Hey, what did you get, something good?

169
00:09:21,405 --> 00:09:23,291
Syphilis? That's not surgical. Who has syphilis?

170
00:09:27,004 --> 00:09:28,077
Excuse us. Sorry.

171
00:09:30,556 --> 00:09:31,707
You have syphilis?

172
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,738
I don't know how this happened.

173
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:43,060
Of course you do.

174
00:09:43,191 --> 00:09:46,315
- Olivia must really be getting around.
- She's not like that.

175
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:47,734
It's a new millennium, George.

176
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,153
The only people who aren't like that are the amish and, apparently, you.

177
00:09:51,368 --> 00:09:52,250
You don't know.

178
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,477
Maybe I've been sleeping around.

179
00:09:54,604 --> 00:09:56,177
Maybe I got ladies.

180
00:09:57,476 --> 00:09:58,414
Shut up.

181
00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:00,272
What am I gonna do?

182
00:10:00,355 --> 00:10:02,919
It's no biggie. A couple doses of penicillin will knock it right out.

183
00:10:02,985 --> 00:10:04,368
What am I gonna do about Olivia?

184
00:10:04,445 --> 00:10:06,109
For starters, stop sleeping with her,

185
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:08,153
unless you want that thing to fall off.

186
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:13,031
Okay, that is twice that you have trash-talked the girl that I could one day potentially --

187
00:10:13,236 --> 00:10:15,251
well, not love, but like a whole lot.

188
00:10:16,452 --> 00:10:18,484
If she gave it to you, you have to tell her.

189
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:19,709
Three.

190
00:10:19,908 --> 00:10:21,710
Fine. She didn't give it to you.

191
00:10:21,797 --> 00:10:23,686
She was a virgin when you met.

192
00:10:24,147 --> 00:10:26,072
You still have to tell her so she can get tested.

193
00:10:26,144 --> 00:10:27,199
Oh, yeah?

194
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:29,021
How am I gonna tell her?

195
00:10:29,591 --> 00:10:32,083
"Uh, hey, Olivia. How you doing?

196
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:34,566
By the way, I got the syph. How about you?"

197
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,683
Maybe not quite like that.

198
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:38,524
No,  it's good advice, really good advice. Thank you very much.

199
00:10:38,943 --> 00:10:39,799
Retract here.

200
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,142
Oh! This just isn't holding.

201
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,173
Give me a bigger retractor, please.

202
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,004
-  Sorry Doctor.
- It wasn't you.

203
00:10:53,024 --> 00:10:54,990
Dr. Bailey, you can finish this.

204
00:10:56,183 --> 00:10:59,297
Uh, thank you, chief. I appreciate the opportunity.

205
00:11:13,112 --> 00:11:16,540
I gotta say, George, I didn't think you had it in you.

206
00:11:17,172 --> 00:11:18,911
It's always the quiet ones.

207
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,205
- So, who's the woman?
- None of your business.

208
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:22,331
Oh, come on.

209
00:11:22,623 --> 00:11:24,590
Who gave you the cooties on the playground?

210
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,364
You must have had something like this before, right?

211
00:11:27,508 --> 00:11:29,760
I never talk about my penis with other men.

212
00:11:32,576 --> 00:11:35,183
I don't n--either, normally.

213
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:40,871
We better get Burke.

214
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:48,469
Mr. Franklin?

215
00:11:50,522 --> 00:11:52,929
You have a condition known as ascites.

216
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:54,849
Oh, my god. I knew it was terrible.

217
00:11:54,973 --> 00:11:57,280
It just means there's fluid in the peritoneal cavity --

218
00:11:58,396 --> 00:11:59,303
the abdomen.

219
00:11:59,697 --> 00:12:02,861
And the swelling is pressing against your lungs, which is why you're having trouble breathing.

220
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,350
In  your case, it looks like a symptom of liver disease.

221
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,838
And it all comes together.

222
00:12:07,945 --> 00:12:09,338
Alice, not now.

223
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:11,592
Is there something we should know?

224
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:16,332
I drink a bit.

225
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:18,463
That's the understatement of the year.

226
00:12:18,657 --> 00:12:20,238
That's enough out of you!

227
00:12:20,342 --> 00:12:22,236
Hey! I'm only here for mom,

228
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,960
to make sure you don't pull any of your usual crap.

229
00:12:28,442 --> 00:12:32,174
There's definitely a growth protruding into the bladder, but look at the edges.

230
00:12:32,241 --> 00:12:33,332
I don't think it's a tumor.

231
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:35,098
Kind of shaped like an ovary.

232
00:12:35,184 --> 00:12:37,929
That the flip answer you're gonna give your patient, Dr. Karev?

233
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:41,277
This is one of my oldest friends. You might want to take this seriously.

234
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,475
I'm sorry, sir.

235
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:43,464
You better be.

236
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:46,372
I got the rest of the labs back.

237
00:12:46,443 --> 00:12:48,968
They did a chromosome analysis of the tissue.

238
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:50,847
You won't believe this.

239
00:12:56,648 --> 00:12:58,066
Bill has an ovary?

240
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:08,337
Um, according to his daughter, Mr. Franklin is a heavy drinker.

241
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:11,024
Six to eight drinks a day, an alcoholic by any standard.

242
00:13:11,093 --> 00:13:11,833
Protocol?

243
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,026
Schedule a paracentesis.

244
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:13,676
Reason?

245
00:13:13,737 --> 00:13:15,652
Draining the fluid will relieve the pressure.

246
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:18,028
Good, but don't schedule it. Do it.

247
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,230
You want us to do the procedure?

248
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:21,296
You've seen one, right?

249
00:13:21,372 --> 00:13:22,069
Absolutely.

250
00:13:22,155 --> 00:13:23,683
Well, now do one.

251
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,234
I've never seen one.

252
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:28,757
You're about to.

253
00:13:29,423 --> 00:13:30,240
Oh, my god.

254
00:13:31,537 --> 00:13:33,119
God, an ovary.

255
00:13:33,215 --> 00:13:35,668
It gives new meaning to the term "metrosexual."

256
00:13:37,223 --> 00:13:38,104
Hi, George.

257
00:13:38,349 --> 00:13:39,149
Olivia.

258
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:40,328
What am I, invisible?

259
00:13:40,972 --> 00:13:41,730
Alex.

260
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:44,249
You go ahead. I'll catch up with you later.

261
00:13:53,905 --> 00:13:55,575
About time I got you alone today.

262
00:14:00,427 --> 00:14:02,593
- Olivia -- 
- What time is your shift done?

263
00:14:02,655 --> 00:14:05,420
Because mine's over at 8:00, and I thought maybe you could come over.

264
00:14:05,548 --> 00:14:07,145
Olivia! I need to tell you something.

265
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:08,338
What's wrong?

266
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,395
Are you breaking up with me?

267
00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:12,312
What? No.

268
00:14:12,557 --> 00:14:14,544
Oh, no, really, no.

269
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:15,425
It's just...

270
00:14:17,452 --> 00:14:22,163
Okay, you're the only person that I've been with in a long time.

271
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:25,629
I mean, not unusually long or anything, you know?

272
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:27,720
Just a normal amount of long time.

273
00:14:27,836 --> 00:14:30,816
But it wouldn't matter to me if you've been with someone else.

274
00:14:31,506 --> 00:14:32,664
Maybe you have?

275
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:36,580
I'm not accusing you of anything or, you know, judging you

276
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:39,739
or handing out scarlet letters or anything, you know?

277
00:14:40,334 --> 00:14:42,622
You're a woman, you know?

278
00:14:43,017 --> 00:14:44,142
A very attractive woman.

279
00:14:44,224 --> 00:14:46,150
Of course you've been with other men.

280
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,234
I mean, not that you've been with a lot of men.

281
00:14:48,315 --> 00:14:50,579
- It's not like you're a prostitute or -- 
- A prostitute?

282
00:14:50,645 --> 00:14:53,575
No! Not a -- not a prostitute.

283
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:57,179
No, the opposite of a prostitute -- a lady.

284
00:14:57,967 --> 00:14:59,263
You're very ladylike.

285
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:01,623
I mean, you're very bendy, but...

286
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:03,824
- George, breathe.
- Okay.

287
00:15:03,931 --> 00:15:05,698
It's just -- okay, here's the thing.

288
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,136
I really like you, Olivia.

289
00:15:09,103 --> 00:15:10,378
I like you a lot.

290
00:15:10,716 --> 00:15:12,702
Well, I like you, too.

291
00:15:16,835 --> 00:15:18,442
I have syphilis.

292
00:15:35,513 --> 00:15:36,893
That could have gone better.

293
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:54,667
You dropped a retractor.

294
00:15:55,758 --> 00:15:56,473
Fine.

295
00:15:58,562 --> 00:16:02,699
A few weeks ago, I was operating, and the vision in my right eye became blurry.

296
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:04,363
After a few hours, it was fine.

297
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:05,444
It's come back again.

298
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:06,714
Did you have it checked out?

299
00:16:06,826 --> 00:16:08,413
The examination was normal.

300
00:16:08,491 --> 00:16:11,087
My ophthalmologist tells me I'm just getting older...

301
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:14,967
but you know what a decline in my visual acuity can mean.

302
00:16:15,423 --> 00:16:16,805
I'll set up some tests.

303
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,670
Shep...

304
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,607
I know how the rumor mill runs around here.

305
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,101
Let's just keep this to ourselves.

306
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:25,816
Absolutely.

307
00:16:27,004 --> 00:16:27,666
Yeah.

308
00:16:34,038 --> 00:16:35,558
Do you think she's talking about me?

309
00:16:35,622 --> 00:16:37,607
She's absolutely talking about you.

310
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:39,835
Dude, that's a good thing.

311
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,335
No. No, it's not.

312
00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:42,707
Georgie, get a clue.

313
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:45,283
Syphilis is the best thing that ever happened to you.

314
00:16:45,646 --> 00:16:47,392
In their eyes, you're a player.

315
00:16:50,506 --> 00:16:51,472
Hey, syph boy.

316
00:16:52,575 --> 00:16:53,520
You told her?

317
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:54,729
Just Cristina.

318
00:16:54,857 --> 00:16:55,740
"Syph boy."

319
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,328
It's got a nice ring to it, kind of like superboy, only diseased.

320
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:01,083
Izzie didn't have to say a word.

321
00:17:01,143 --> 00:17:04,387
Around here, the only thing that spreads faster than disease is gossip.

322
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:05,522
That's not true.

323
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,206
Just 'cause Izzie can't keep her mouth shut doesn't mean everyone...

324
00:17:08,257 --> 00:17:12,014
Hey George, how are you feeling? Sorry about the syphilis.

325
00:17:12,306 --> 00:17:14,713
Everyone in this hospital knows?

326
00:17:15,906 --> 00:17:17,586
Knows you're a player.

327
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:18,906
You're disturbed.

328
00:17:18,983 --> 00:17:19,757
True.

329
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,614
Everybody's got a secret.

330
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,341
Be glad yours is out in the open.

331
00:17:23,412 --> 00:17:25,101
Oh, yeah, Alex? What's yours?

332
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:27,222
You show me yours, and I'll show you mine.

333
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,665
I'll bet she's got some serious and kinky skeletons in the closet.

334
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,616
What's in my closet is none of your business.

335
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:39,546
Well, I don't have any secrets. My life is boring.

336
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:41,434
Everybody's got something to hide.

337
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,303
Well, the mass we found is not a tumor.

338
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:56,184
Well, that's good, right? Anything's got to be better than cancer.

339
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,126
That's where it gets a little tricky.

340
00:17:58,699 --> 00:18:03,846
The chromosomal tests have revealed that your body contains DNA from two different embryos

341
00:18:03,902 --> 00:18:06,887
that merged in the womb at the very beginning of development.

342
00:18:06,957 --> 00:18:08,791
In rare cases such as yours,

343
00:18:08,898 --> 00:18:11,816
the condition can produce gonadal hermaphroditism.

344
00:18:12,503 --> 00:18:16,097
I'm hearing scary words here, Preston, you know, pay-cable kind of words.

345
00:18:16,174 --> 00:18:17,054
In english,

346
00:18:17,715 --> 00:18:19,718
the mass in your bladder is an ovary.

347
00:18:20,838 --> 00:18:22,650
Don't worry. We're gonna remove it.

348
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:26,666
We have an excellent gynecological surgeon on staff.

349
00:18:26,782 --> 00:18:29,742
You're telling me I'm a guy with an ovary?

350
00:18:29,854 --> 00:18:31,907
It's simply a quirk of nature, man.

351
00:18:37,814 --> 00:18:39,767
What am I gonna tell Holly?

352
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:41,136
That you're gonna be fine.

353
00:18:42,215 --> 00:18:43,729
I'm still a man, right?

354
00:18:43,996 --> 00:18:46,326
A man's man, a kappa man.

355
00:18:46,623 --> 00:18:49,910
I mean... you know, my sex life.

356
00:18:50,043 --> 00:18:51,625
Been having any problems?

357
00:18:52,537 --> 00:18:55,147
Was it my very pregnant wife that give it away?

358
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,962
Come on, man, don't worry.

359
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,935
You never knew it was there. You won't miss it when it's gone.

360
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:07,829
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

361
00:19:07,936 --> 00:19:10,732
It's a shot of penicillin, George. Be grateful I'm even doing this.

362
00:19:10,762 --> 00:19:12,806
I'm about to see more of you than I ever wanted to.

363
00:19:13,206 --> 00:19:14,679
I'll be fighting nightmares for a week.

364
00:19:14,758 --> 00:19:15,771
Okay, you know what? Forget this.

365
00:19:15,846 --> 00:19:17,429
Do you want to get rid of the syph or not?

366
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,017
Just shut up and drop them.

367
00:19:22,217 --> 00:19:23,450
I cannot believe this.

368
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:25,781
Meredith, go away!

369
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:28,966
Oh, George, I'll give you some moral support.

370
00:19:29,022 --> 00:19:30,930
No. No moral support.

371
00:19:31,197 --> 00:19:32,447
I'm indisposed here.

372
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:35,682
George, it's not a big deal.

373
00:19:35,923 --> 00:19:37,515
And you have a cute butt.

374
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,887
I have a cute butt, too.

375
00:19:39,005 --> 00:19:39,630
You want to see?

376
00:19:39,749 --> 00:19:41,760
Oh, get out. You're doing it wrong.

377
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:42,831
Be my guest.

378
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,106
What -- Alex.

379
00:19:44,596 --> 00:19:45,319
Alex.

380
00:19:49,598 --> 00:19:50,332
H ey!

381
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:51,914
What are we doing here?

382
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:54,008
Breaking George's spirit.

383
00:19:54,105 --> 00:19:55,569
Curing george's syph.

384
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,744
I don't like needles.

385
00:19:57,828 --> 00:19:59,344
Good thing you became a doctor.

386
00:19:59,421 --> 00:20:00,331
Other side.

387
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,749
- Izzie?
- Yeah?

388
00:20:02,313 --> 00:20:05,072
Mr. Franklin's procedure's been scheduled for after lunch --

389
00:20:05,184 --> 00:20:06,168
What are we doing?

390
00:20:06,362 --> 00:20:10,582
We are saving george from a future of festering sores and insanity.

391
00:20:10,653 --> 00:20:11,704
Oh, cute butt.

392
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:12,671
Told you.

393
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:14,330
It is cute, like a baby's.

394
00:20:17,939 --> 00:20:20,816
You know, I have spent hours, days, years,

395
00:20:20,985 --> 00:20:24,887
imagining myself half-naked in a room with three women.

396
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:27,851
The reality is so much better.

397
00:20:28,805 --> 00:20:30,002
I think he's gonna cry.

398
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:34,640
Hi. It's Ms. Henry again.

399
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,992
Is this a better time?

400
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:38,527
Sorry about this morning. I wasn't alone and --

401
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:39,916
What were you calling about?

402
00:20:40,093 --> 00:20:43,431
I just wanted to remind you that tonight's our monthly family dinner.

403
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:46,882
You know, you haven't been to any of our family functions.

404
00:20:47,328 --> 00:20:51,608
You have to understand. I'm a surgical intern, so my time isn't my own.

405
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,989
Our residents really respond to these events.

406
00:20:54,071 --> 00:20:57,062
They always enjoy themselves, which is so rare.

407
00:20:57,134 --> 00:20:58,786
I think it's important you attend.

408
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:00,988
I'll be there.

409
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,384
I'll try to be there.

410
00:21:03,589 --> 00:21:05,007
I'll definitely try.

411
00:21:06,477 --> 00:21:08,383
I've cleared some time for your M.R.I.

412
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,728
- Good. Let's get going.
- Okay.

413
00:21:10,128 --> 00:21:13,010
Uh... sorry to bother you with this, chief.

414
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:15,765
We've got kind of a situation.

415
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,326
What now?

416
00:21:17,724 --> 00:21:21,511
Three interns, four residents, and six nurses

417
00:21:21,586 --> 00:21:26,982
on this surgical floor have been diagnosed with... syphilis.

418
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:30,679
There are over 70,000 new cases every year.

419
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:35,949
Undiagnosed, syphilis can lead to blindness, insanity, and death.

420
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:42,548
If you are having unprotected sex with another member of the staff, get tested.

421
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,592
This is not a request.

422
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:52,900
Patricia will now give you a safe-sex demonstration.

423
00:21:55,451 --> 00:22:00,053
When the time is right, and, gentlemen, you'll all know when that time is,

424
00:22:00,295 --> 00:22:03,652
carefully open the condom packet...

425
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,852
and roll it onto the banana.

426
00:22:06,966 --> 00:22:09,019
We should try and get down to do the M.R.I. now.

427
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,995
This isn't really a good time.

428
00:22:11,184 --> 00:22:13,006
If you want to do this without anybody else knowing,

429
00:22:13,452 --> 00:22:14,394
you should do it now.

430
00:22:21,261 --> 00:22:22,232
Poor George.

431
00:22:22,647 --> 00:22:23,313
Yeah.

432
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,084
You know, I think he really likes typhoid Mary.

433
00:22:26,872 --> 00:22:30,533
Well, not many budding relationships survive a good dose of V.D.

434
00:22:32,258 --> 00:22:32,905
Yeah.

435
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:35,807
Yeah.

436
00:22:35,903 --> 00:22:40,814
...gently peel off the condom and dispose of it properly.

437
00:22:41,397 --> 00:22:45,254
With every fresh banana, always use a fresh condom.

438
00:23:16,198 --> 00:23:17,100
You're avoiding me.

439
00:23:18,513 --> 00:23:21,259
I'm busy... at work. I-I'm working.

440
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:24,298
Why are you in this line?

441
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,283
It's the syphilis line.

442
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,116
You don't need to be in this line.

443
00:23:29,351 --> 00:23:30,154
I don't?

444
00:23:31,681 --> 00:23:32,650
There's no one else.

445
00:23:35,634 --> 00:23:36,617
That surprises you?

446
00:23:38,434 --> 00:23:39,690
Nothing surprises me.

447
00:23:42,428 --> 00:23:43,652
Do I need to be in this line?

448
00:23:46,601 --> 00:23:47,272
No.

449
00:23:49,827 --> 00:23:50,923
- Okay.
- Okay.

450
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:53,744
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

451
00:23:53,918 --> 00:23:55,279
Mr. Franklin's prepped and ready.

452
00:23:55,397 --> 00:23:56,120
Excellent.

453
00:23:56,221 --> 00:23:57,440
God, look at this line.

454
00:23:58,065 --> 00:23:59,592
Well, at least we don't have to stand in line.

455
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:02,197
That's the one good thing about the fact neither of us is getting any, right?

456
00:24:05,864 --> 00:24:08,360
Mr. Franklin, we've given you a local anaesthetic,

457
00:24:08,449 --> 00:24:09,687
but you might feel some pressure.

458
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,935
Okay,

459
00:24:16,201 --> 00:24:17,071
I'm ready.

460
00:24:17,337 --> 00:24:17,936
Grab the skin.

461
00:24:23,507 --> 00:24:24,925
I'm in the peritoneal cavity.

462
00:24:30,305 --> 00:24:31,320
That fluid is bloody.

463
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:32,399
Is it supposed to be bloody?

464
00:24:32,561 --> 00:24:34,064
You've done this before, right?

465
00:24:34,145 --> 00:24:35,631
- Of course. 
- Millions of times.

466
00:24:37,314 --> 00:24:38,847
You're doing great, Mr. Franklin.

467
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:41,672
Okay, wait, wait.

468
00:24:43,763 --> 00:24:44,699
Okay, go.

469
00:24:50,772 --> 00:24:51,676
Good.

470
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:55,333
Now all we have to do is wait.

471
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,247
You see that right there?

472
00:25:01,702 --> 00:25:02,592
It's a tumor,

473
00:25:03,217 --> 00:25:05,036
and it's pressing against your optic nerve.

474
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:05,975
Is it operable?

475
00:25:06,058 --> 00:25:06,985
Oh, definitely.

476
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,605
It does have its risks.

477
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:12,526
You mean I could lose my sight?

478
00:25:13,288 --> 00:25:16,330
Just what I need -- a syphilis outbreak and a tumor.

479
00:25:16,467 --> 00:25:17,776
Well, it's probably unrelated.

480
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:22,704
All right, Derek, let's see how good you really are.

481
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:25,929
All right. I'll put a team together.

482
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,215
All my people only.

483
00:25:27,748 --> 00:25:29,283
And I still want this kept under wraps.

484
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,342
The vultures will be circling soon enough.

485
00:25:31,419 --> 00:25:32,570
Aren't I one of the vultures?

486
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:34,486
Why do you think I want to keep an eye on you?

487
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:36,897
Get going. We're doing this tonight.

488
00:25:37,147 --> 00:25:37,752
Right.

489
00:25:44,324 --> 00:25:45,089
You paged.

490
00:25:45,248 --> 00:25:47,572
Yeah, I need you to help me out on something for the chief.

491
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,041
Can you keep a secret?

492
00:25:49,768 --> 00:25:51,023
Better than you think.

493
00:25:53,922 --> 00:25:55,779
How much fluid can one body hold?

494
00:25:57,412 --> 00:26:00,705
There's a lot of fluid in there, Mr. Franklin, but we're almost finished.

495
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:05,343
Mr. Franklin, are you sleeping?

496
00:26:06,821 --> 00:26:08,109
Mr. Franklin?

497
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:09,925
- He has no pulse.
- What?

498
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:11,079
He has no pulse!

499
00:26:14,263 --> 00:26:16,259
Code blue. Code blue.

500
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:29,265
Nobody die just like that with no warning.

501
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:31,236
There was blood in the tube when it first went in.

502
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:33,070
What if it's our fault? What if we did something wrong?

503
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:34,143
We didn't do anything wrong.

504
00:26:34,216 --> 00:26:35,428
We did a textbook procedure.

505
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,366
I checked your chart.

506
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:40,621
You did everything by the book.

507
00:26:40,693 --> 00:26:42,643
He died on our watch. We must have missed something.

508
00:26:42,746 --> 00:26:45,536
There was no history of heart problems.

509
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:46,965
His death wasn't your fault.

510
00:26:47,184 --> 00:26:48,209
When's the autopsy?

511
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:49,756
There isn't gonna be an autopsy.

512
00:26:50,174 --> 00:26:52,607
What? How are we supposed to know the cause of death?

513
00:26:52,674 --> 00:26:56,884
It's going down as cardiopulmonary arrest complicated by liver disease.

514
00:26:56,954 --> 00:26:57,844
But an autopsy would --

515
00:26:57,911 --> 00:27:01,746
The family decided they didn't want an autopsy.

516
00:27:01,813 --> 00:27:05,141
- But Dr. Bailey -- 
- They don't want an autopsy. Let it go.

517
00:27:16,656 --> 00:27:20,362
How goes our special, supersecret, silent, sunset surgery?

518
00:27:20,995 --> 00:27:22,171
I've been practicing that.

519
00:27:22,493 --> 00:27:24,193
You have too much time on your hands.

520
00:27:24,274 --> 00:27:27,588
Uh, tell the chief I'll be there. Just let me know when and where. I'm in.

521
00:27:27,678 --> 00:27:28,334
Okay.

522
00:27:33,066 --> 00:27:33,931
Are you nervous?

523
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,242
It's a complicated surgery.

524
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:38,839
I make one mistake, I end a fellow surgeon's career, my mentor's career.

525
00:27:38,902 --> 00:27:40,772
Oh, no, I'm not nervous.

526
00:27:42,982 --> 00:27:44,161
So, just for the record...

527
00:27:44,534 --> 00:27:46,685
you'd tell me if I need to get tested, right?

528
00:27:47,304 --> 00:27:48,732
You think I have syphilis?

529
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:49,741
No, I don't.

530
00:27:49,828 --> 00:27:51,830
It's just -- we never made any rules or anything.

531
00:27:51,908 --> 00:27:54,466
I mean, we never said,

532
00:27:54,656 --> 00:27:57,621
"we have rules", and I wouldn't hold it against you.

533
00:27:57,692 --> 00:28:00,443
When would I have time to go out and get syphilis?

534
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,594
You're a handful enough as it is, and besides, we're, like, practically a condom ad.

535
00:28:04,723 --> 00:28:06,838
But no more glow-in-the-dark ones.

536
00:28:06,929 --> 00:28:08,871
You see? There's nothing to worry about.

537
00:28:09,683 --> 00:28:12,064
Maybe we should, you know, make some rules, I mean.

538
00:28:12,326 --> 00:28:13,130
We should.

539
00:28:13,498 --> 00:28:14,221
Okay.

540
00:28:14,517 --> 00:28:15,326
Okay.

541
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:18,941
Just for the record...

542
00:28:19,545 --> 00:28:21,757
I liked the glow-in-the-dark ones.

543
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:23,272
I bet you do.

544
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,640
That's the last of the ovarian material.

545
00:28:33,825 --> 00:28:36,898
I just need to sew up the perforation on the bladder wall.

546
00:28:40,175 --> 00:28:41,950
Is there a problem, Dr. Knox?

547
00:28:42,075 --> 00:28:44,413
Well, you said this man's wife is pregnant?

548
00:28:44,638 --> 00:28:45,965
Due in five weeks. Why?

549
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:48,550
Our patient has a blind vas deferens.

550
00:28:50,587 --> 00:28:51,555
Bill is sterile?

551
00:28:51,714 --> 00:28:52,984
And always has been.

552
00:28:54,546 --> 00:28:56,644
Then who got his wife pregnant?

553
00:29:03,715 --> 00:29:05,252
Sucks to be Bill right now.

554
00:29:05,354 --> 00:29:07,525
How's Burke gonna tell him the baby's not his?

555
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:08,641
Burke's not gonna tell him.

556
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:09,966
He has to. They're friends.

557
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,257
Bill's better off not knowing.

558
00:29:11,324 --> 00:29:12,912
Do you think Holly knows Bill's not the father?

559
00:29:12,988 --> 00:29:13,770
Maybe, maybe not.

560
00:29:13,846 --> 00:29:16,293
Bill should know his wife's cheating on him.

561
00:29:16,534 --> 00:29:20,156
I don't remember asking for your opinions, so keep them to yourselves.

562
00:29:20,244 --> 00:29:21,262
Sorry, sir.

563
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:23,304
You're such a gossip.

564
00:29:29,153 --> 00:29:31,184
We know how confusing this must be,

565
00:29:31,277 --> 00:29:33,228
your husband dying so suddenly,

566
00:29:33,595 --> 00:29:35,881
but an autopsy will tell us why.

567
00:29:36,397 --> 00:29:39,490
So, you think we should do the autopsy?

568
00:29:39,648 --> 00:29:41,383
No, we just want this to be over.

569
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:44,395
But don't you want to know for certain what killed him?

570
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:48,042
My father was a mean drunk who couldn't hold a job.

571
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:49,479
That's what killed him.

572
00:29:49,874 --> 00:29:51,543
I understand that you're angry,

573
00:29:51,631 --> 00:29:55,469
but knowing for sure might help give you some closure.

574
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:58,506
It was awfully sudden, Alice.

575
00:29:58,679 --> 00:29:59,413
Sudden?

576
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:02,627
He's been killing himself for years.

577
00:30:02,811 --> 00:30:04,229
He was a good man.

578
00:30:05,807 --> 00:30:07,219
Maybe they're right.

579
00:30:07,369 --> 00:30:08,920
Maybe we should do the autopsy.

580
00:30:08,997 --> 00:30:10,728
Mom, stop it.

581
00:30:11,136 --> 00:30:12,181
He's dead.

582
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:14,348
It's finally over.

583
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:17,953
Alice, your father would have wanted --

584
00:30:18,013 --> 00:30:19,580
Who cares what he wanted?

585
00:30:20,424 --> 00:30:25,908
Can't we please just try and get out of this with whatever shred of dignity this family has left?

586
00:30:40,008 --> 00:30:43,281
You guys want to perform an unauthorized autopsy?

587
00:30:44,525 --> 00:30:48,032
I know you, Cristina. You do not want to be known as the new 007.

588
00:30:48,114 --> 00:30:49,614
An autopsy clears your name.

589
00:30:50,531 --> 00:30:52,533
Cristina, no.

590
00:30:52,757 --> 00:30:54,022
What about Franklin's wife?

591
00:30:54,242 --> 00:30:56,869
You saw the way she was looking at me. She wants the autopsy.

592
00:30:56,942 --> 00:30:58,600
She just didn't want to fight with her daughter.

593
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,906
She looked so sad.

594
00:31:01,821 --> 00:31:04,196
Okay, Cristina Yang, licensed to kill.

595
00:31:07,893 --> 00:31:08,886
Okay, I'm in.

596
00:31:09,456 --> 00:31:11,144
I am so not involved in this.

597
00:31:11,215 --> 00:31:12,446
Meredith, this is fight club.

598
00:31:12,511 --> 00:31:13,612
Nobody talks about it.

599
00:31:13,704 --> 00:31:14,293
Fine.

600
00:31:15,218 --> 00:31:16,541
We have to do it when Bailey's not around.

601
00:31:16,617 --> 00:31:18,818
She's everywhere and knows everything.

602
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,402
We have to take our chances.

603
00:31:20,548 --> 00:31:23,139
Bailey's got something tonight from 7:00 to 11:00.

604
00:31:23,201 --> 00:31:25,090
You two will be the last thing she's worried about.

605
00:31:25,173 --> 00:31:26,898
- How do you know that?
- What kind of something?

606
00:31:27,141 --> 00:31:29,960
Oh, I can't tell you that. It's fight club, too.

607
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,484
If I'm missing out on a real patient because of this,

608
00:31:35,567 --> 00:31:38,678
they're gonna call me 007 because I've killed you.

609
00:31:46,256 --> 00:31:47,014
How we doing?

610
00:31:47,158 --> 00:31:48,423
Did you lock up the gallery?

611
00:31:48,582 --> 00:31:50,310
Don't worry. We're flying under the radar.

612
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,647
What did you put out there, the midas rex?

613
00:31:52,755 --> 00:31:53,953
We've got it, chief.

614
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,448
How much vancomycin is there?

615
00:31:55,534 --> 00:31:57,188
One gram, as ordered, sir.

616
00:31:57,275 --> 00:31:59,707
You're not gonna be too liberal with those benzos?

617
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:01,914
You know, doctors make the worst patients.

618
00:32:02,002 --> 00:32:03,797
You should just breathe in the happy gas.

619
00:32:03,891 --> 00:32:05,626
Stop running my O.R.

620
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:08,744
I've got you covered.

621
00:32:16,204 --> 00:32:17,106
We stole a body.

622
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:19,757
We're body snatchers.

623
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:22,670
What if somebody from the morgue comes looking for Franklin?

624
00:32:22,753 --> 00:32:25,276
Well, "A" it's in the middle of the night, and "B"

625
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:28,200
the thing about being dead is people stop looking for you.

626
00:32:29,025 --> 00:32:29,803
Okay.

627
00:32:31,755 --> 00:32:33,361
When's the last time you did an autopsy?

628
00:32:33,459 --> 00:32:36,321
I took gross anatomy like you. I'm just trying to remember.

629
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,133
You know what? Hold on. Hold on. Wait.

630
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:39,163
Hold on.

631
00:32:40,473 --> 00:32:41,640
You brought a textbook?

632
00:32:41,809 --> 00:32:44,200
Uh, if we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it right.

633
00:32:49,238 --> 00:32:50,053
Okay.

634
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:53,504
Okay, got it.

635
00:32:53,704 --> 00:32:54,522
You sure?

636
00:32:54,702 --> 00:32:56,653
It's not like we can kill him twice.

637
00:33:01,275 --> 00:33:02,152
Let me cut.

638
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:03,621
You'll get your turn.

639
00:33:06,892 --> 00:33:08,413
You should really be using the 10 blade.

640
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:10,190
Will you stop backseat cutting?

641
00:33:10,266 --> 00:33:11,465
Go get the saw.

642
00:33:13,042 --> 00:33:16,211
Okay, I've sutured the drain in place. The staples look fine.

643
00:33:16,277 --> 00:33:18,259
All right, we're done here. Dr. Bailey, you want to wrap him?

644
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,603
Nice work, everybody, nicely done.

645
00:33:20,685 --> 00:33:21,326
Thanks.

646
00:33:21,403 --> 00:33:22,154
Good.

647
00:33:27,521 --> 00:33:29,594
Do you think the optic nerve is damaged?

648
00:33:30,172 --> 00:33:33,292
If it is, when he wakes up, he'll --

649
00:33:33,352 --> 00:33:34,259
He'll be blind?

650
00:33:35,254 --> 00:33:36,164
For how long?

651
00:33:36,702 --> 00:33:37,531
Forever.

652
00:33:38,397 --> 00:33:39,850
Page Stevens and Yang.

653
00:33:39,926 --> 00:33:42,063
Tell them I want them covering your patients.

654
00:33:42,282 --> 00:33:45,518
I need you to stay and monitor the chief.

655
00:33:47,678 --> 00:33:52,047
Cristina and Izzie, um... I think they're already swamped.

656
00:33:52,195 --> 00:33:53,101
With what?

657
00:33:53,229 --> 00:33:56,172
Labs -- they had to check on some labs.

658
00:33:58,364 --> 00:34:00,504
Oh, you are lying.

659
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,054
I know you're lying.

660
00:34:03,152 --> 00:34:04,032
You know how I know?

661
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:05,471
'Cause you're a bad liar!

662
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,314
I hate a bad liar.

663
00:34:12,007 --> 00:34:13,735
Take over for me.

664
00:34:14,062 --> 00:34:16,147
I know exactly where they are.

665
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:16,976
Take over.

666
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,251
Your whole relationship is a lie.

667
00:34:28,451 --> 00:34:29,586
We're happy.

668
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,644
We've wanted a child for a long time.

669
00:34:31,767 --> 00:34:33,384
Why do you want to take this away from him?

670
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:34,446
Does he know you've been cheating on him?

671
00:34:34,501 --> 00:34:37,021
Preston, this is between Bill and me.

672
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:39,242
The man has a right to know that this isn't his child.

673
00:34:40,304 --> 00:34:42,642
Please, just let this go.

674
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:43,876
Why can't you let this go?

675
00:34:43,968 --> 00:34:45,693
Because Bill is my best friend. That's why.

676
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,937
If you were really his friend, you wouldn't do this.

677
00:34:47,988 --> 00:34:49,401
Holly, please! Tell him the truth!

678
00:34:49,477 --> 00:34:50,293
Why?

679
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,174
I'm not gonna ruin my life because you think this is wrong.

680
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:54,086
Your life?

681
00:34:54,495 --> 00:34:55,606
What about his life?

682
00:34:55,682 --> 00:34:57,271
What about this child's life?

683
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:59,856
What Bill doesn't know won't hurt him.

684
00:35:02,626 --> 00:35:03,404
Fine.

685
00:35:05,073 --> 00:35:06,967
Maybe his friend won't tell him the truth,

686
00:35:08,013 --> 00:35:09,605
but I'm also his doctor,

687
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:12,559
and his doctor is not going to lie to him.

688
00:35:18,371 --> 00:35:22,353
I know, but something came up, an important surgery, and I couldn't.

689
00:35:22,522 --> 00:35:24,549
I'm just sorry you couldn't be there for your mother.

690
00:35:24,908 --> 00:35:28,016
Ms. Henry, if my mother were lucid, she would understand.

691
00:35:28,062 --> 00:35:29,076
She's a surgeon.

692
00:35:29,173 --> 00:35:31,221
She's done this countless times.

693
00:35:31,498 --> 00:35:34,477
And besides, she doesn't even know who I am anyway, so...

694
00:35:34,887 --> 00:35:36,024
Today she did.

695
00:35:37,027 --> 00:35:37,806
What?

696
00:35:38,215 --> 00:35:41,599
Your mother's been asking when her daughter Meredith gets off from work.

697
00:35:44,452 --> 00:35:45,085
Hey.

698
00:35:47,421 --> 00:35:48,235
Hey.

699
00:35:48,967 --> 00:35:50,565
A lot of secret phone calls today.

700
00:35:57,174 --> 00:35:58,537
Yeah, it's my mother.

701
00:36:03,268 --> 00:36:04,584
She isn't traveling.

702
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:07,353
She isn't writing a book.

703
00:36:08,782 --> 00:36:10,139
She isn't anything.

704
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:12,064
I've been lying to everyone.

705
00:36:13,307 --> 00:36:14,131
Why?

706
00:36:15,796 --> 00:36:17,281
She has alzheimer's.

707
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:20,543
- How advanced?
- Very.

708
00:36:20,906 --> 00:36:24,443
She's in a home, and I'm the only one who even knows she's sick.

709
00:36:25,422 --> 00:36:28,074
I just don't know what to do anymore, you know?

710
00:36:48,585 --> 00:36:53,172
Don't even tell me you're doing what I think you're doing!

711
00:37:02,993 --> 00:37:05,522
Not only did you disregard the family's wishes, you broke the law!

712
00:37:05,578 --> 00:37:07,472
You could be arrested for assault!

713
00:37:07,554 --> 00:37:09,121
Do you like jail?

714
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:13,141
The hospital could be sued! I could lose my license, my job!

715
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:14,616
I like my job!

716
00:37:14,687 --> 00:37:18,890
Did you think about any of this before you started cutting open a poor man's body?

717
00:37:18,972 --> 00:37:21,590
I could seriously kick both your asses right now.

718
00:37:21,645 --> 00:37:23,217
Do you have anything to say?

719
00:37:25,598 --> 00:37:26,724
Look at his heart.

720
00:37:26,929 --> 00:37:28,521
It's huge!

721
00:37:28,603 --> 00:37:30,084
It's over 600 grams,

722
00:37:30,324 --> 00:37:32,249
and there's some kind of grainy material in it.

723
00:37:32,327 --> 00:37:33,534
We want to run some tests.

724
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:35,352
Oh, now you want to run tests?

725
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:37,419
At this point, what could it hurt?

726
00:37:39,115 --> 00:37:41,941
I hate both of you right now.

727
00:37:53,256 --> 00:37:54,055
Meredith...

728
00:37:55,269 --> 00:37:56,401
he's an attending.

729
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,080
You're an intern.

730
00:37:58,503 --> 00:37:59,538
You saw us?

731
00:38:00,558 --> 00:38:01,811
You can see.

732
00:38:03,989 --> 00:38:06,819
I'm gonna tell you what your mother would say if she were here.

733
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,030
You're making a mistake --

734
00:38:10,306 --> 00:38:11,293
a big one.

735
00:38:13,572 --> 00:38:16,041
And I would tell my mother it's not a mistake.

736
00:38:19,071 --> 00:38:22,155
We specifically said no autopsy.

737
00:38:22,645 --> 00:38:25,826
I understand why you're upset.

738
00:38:25,901 --> 00:38:27,007
You understand?

739
00:38:27,331 --> 00:38:29,266
We're gonna get an attorney.

740
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:30,126
Come on, mom.

741
00:38:30,212 --> 00:38:31,693
We know what killed him.

742
00:38:31,887 --> 00:38:35,318
He had a blood condition known as hemachromatosis.

743
00:38:35,492 --> 00:38:39,184
The disease causes an excess amount of iron to build up in the body,

744
00:38:39,286 --> 00:38:42,962
and that's what caused the heart failure, not the paracentesis.

745
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,752
But I thought he was always so sick 'cause of the drinking.

746
00:38:46,868 --> 00:38:49,792
And you never let him forget it... or me.

747
00:38:49,883 --> 00:38:51,604
- Mom...
- There's something else.

748
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,104
The disease is genetic.

749
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:54,671
You think Alice could have it, too?

750
00:38:54,748 --> 00:38:56,509
A simple blood test will tell us.

751
00:38:56,678 --> 00:39:00,963
If you have it, we'll have caught it early enough to treat it before the condition becomes critical.

752
00:39:01,046 --> 00:39:04,884
Dr. Stevens and Dr. Yang may have saved your life.

753
00:39:10,444 --> 00:39:11,628
If you could just...

754
00:39:12,232 --> 00:39:15,531
sign this consent form for the autopsy --

755
00:39:15,935 --> 00:39:17,460
just a formality.

756
00:39:22,556 --> 00:39:28,525
The thing people forget is how good it can feel when you finally set secrets free.

757
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:36,025
Whether good or bad, at least they're out in the open...

758
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:38,590
like it or not.

759
00:39:52,979 --> 00:39:53,896
About before -- 

760
00:39:53,979 --> 00:39:57,596
George, I want you to understand --

761
00:39:58,364 --> 00:40:01,794
when we started dating, I was already kind of seeing someone.

762
00:40:02,721 --> 00:40:04,832
I didn't know how much I'd like you,

763
00:40:05,091 --> 00:40:07,622
and when I realized, I broke it off with the other guy --

764
00:40:07,704 --> 00:40:08,546
Other guy?

765
00:40:10,424 --> 00:40:11,907
Who's the other guy?

766
00:40:17,009 --> 00:40:18,066
You and Alex?

767
00:40:21,042 --> 00:40:22,440
You and Alex?!

768
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,589
You gave me syphilis?!

769
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:25,603
George!

770
00:40:25,828 --> 00:40:26,780
George!

771
00:40:27,113 --> 00:40:28,481
George, back off!

772
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:29,740
Alex!

773
00:40:29,914 --> 00:40:30,532
George!

774
00:40:30,816 --> 00:40:31,941
Back off, Alex.

775
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:37,256
And once your secrets are out in the open,

776
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:39,499
you don't have to hide behind them anymore.

777
00:40:43,825 --> 00:40:45,606
- Long day.
- Yeah.

778
00:40:46,453 --> 00:40:50,481
Someone out there has a steak with your name on it and maybe a bottle of wine.

779
00:40:51,029 --> 00:40:53,231
This is why I keep you around.

780
00:40:53,798 --> 00:40:55,064
So, we need to talk.

781
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,995
Wine first, talk later.

782
00:40:57,727 --> 00:41:01,171
You trying to, uh, get me drunk so you can take advantage of me?

783
00:41:02,165 --> 00:41:04,326
I think I like this rules thing.

784
00:41:05,523 --> 00:41:06,256
Me too.

785
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,512
Meredith, I am so sorry.

786
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:27,454
The problem with secrets is even when you think you're in control...

787
00:41:28,508 --> 00:41:29,501
Addison.

788
00:41:29,866 --> 00:41:30,823
 ...You're not.

789
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:32,450
What are you doing here?

790
00:41:32,651 --> 00:41:36,168
You'd know if you'd bothered to return any one of my phone calls.

791
00:41:37,187 --> 00:41:39,275
Hi. I'm Addison Shepherd.

792
00:41:41,861 --> 00:41:42,751
Shepherd?

793
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:46,551
And you must be the woman who's been screwing my husband.

794
