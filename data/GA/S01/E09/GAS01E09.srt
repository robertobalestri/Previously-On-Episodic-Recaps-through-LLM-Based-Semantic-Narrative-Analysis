1
00:00:01,116 --> 00:00:03,024
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:03,152 --> 00:00:04,125
How hot is the sex?

3
00:00:04,175 --> 00:00:05,814
Some people would call this a relationship.

4
00:00:05,866 --> 00:00:08,389
It's just that I hardly know anything about you.

5
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:11,211
We're having sex every night.
I think I deserve details.

6
00:00:11,257 --> 00:00:12,384
You have more details than most.

7
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:14,795
What makes a hotshot doc leave
the big apple for Seattle?

8
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:15,963
Thanks for the coffee.

9
00:00:19,674 --> 00:00:21,328
Adoption? Keeping the baby?

10
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:22,957
I know this is a difficult decision.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,690
I'm not interested.

12
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,940
I am not your sister!

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,750
I am a man!

14
00:00:26,838 --> 00:00:27,769
You need to get laid.

15
00:00:27,851 --> 00:00:28,860
See that nurse over there?

16
00:00:28,966 --> 00:00:31,681
She's single. She's got red hair. Go ask her out.

17
00:00:31,819 --> 00:00:33,289
Smooth moves, doctor.

18
00:00:34,082 --> 00:00:34,931
Who is that?

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,720
That's dad.

20
00:00:35,798 --> 00:00:36,985
What's her diagnosis?

21
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:37,912
Alzheimer's.

22
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:39,955
She doesn't want anyone to know.

23
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:42,331
I'm the only person she'll allow to see her.

24
00:00:48,168 --> 00:00:50,667
Secrets can't hide in science.

25
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,117
Medicine has a way of exposing the lies.

26
00:00:55,136 --> 00:00:59,538
Within the walls of the hospital,
the truth is stripped bare.

27
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:03,041
How we keep our secrets outside the hospital -

28
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,564
well, that's a little different.

29
00:01:11,146 --> 00:01:14,081
George. You locked the door.
I need to take a shower.

30
00:01:14,147 --> 00:01:16,041
Uh, uh, I'll be out in a minute.

31
00:01:17,064 --> 00:01:18,074
What are you doing in there?

32
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:19,235
It's private.

33
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:23,040
Oh. Oh, god. I'm sorry. I get it.

34
00:01:23,157 --> 00:01:24,590
I don't mean to interrupt.

35
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:25,958
No, it's not that!

36
00:01:26,224 --> 00:01:27,729
It's okay. Take your time.

37
00:01:28,101 --> 00:01:30,572
I am not doing what you think I'm doing.

38
00:01:30,628 --> 00:01:35,025
There's really no need to explain.
I'll wait. You just... finish.

39
00:01:35,102 --> 00:01:37,663
No, I'm - I'm coming. I'm coming out!

40
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:39,485
One thing is certain.

41
00:01:39,993 --> 00:01:41,897
Whatever it is we're trying to hide,

42
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,733
we're never ready for that moment
when the truth gets naked.

43
00:01:46,803 --> 00:01:50,278
Dr. Grey, this is Ms. Henry from the nursing home.

44
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:51,825
I'm calling about your mother.

45
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,782
Is she all right?

46
00:01:52,843 --> 00:01:54,241
Oh, it's nothing like that.

47
00:01:54,318 --> 00:01:55,721
Can I call you later then?

48
00:01:55,802 --> 00:01:58,087
- Uh, I just wanted to -
- I have to go.

49
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:03,817
Oh, my god. Who is calling you at this hour?

50
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:05,588
It's a wrong number.

51
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:14,506
There's no reason to be ashamed.
It's normal, healthy even.

52
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:17,128
I'm not ashamed 'cause I wasn't doing anything.

53
00:02:17,624 --> 00:02:19,355
I don't have to. I have a girlfriend.

54
00:02:19,565 --> 00:02:21,199
An imaginary girlfriend?

55
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:24,224
An actual girlfriend.

56
00:02:24,382 --> 00:02:25,846
You know what? It's no big deal.

57
00:02:25,914 --> 00:02:27,671
You don't have to lie. I get it.

58
00:02:27,778 --> 00:02:28,776
You have needs.

59
00:02:31,106 --> 00:02:32,919
What is going on out here?

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,614
Nothing.

61
00:02:34,925 --> 00:02:35,618
Nothing.

62
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:36,959
Nothing.

63
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:41,459
He's freaked out 'cause I caught him
playing with little jimmy and the twins.

64
00:02:41,582 --> 00:02:42,610
I have girlfriend.

65
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,834
Okay.

66
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,539
This sounds like fun out here.

67
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,045
Aren't you gonna get that?
It might be the hospital.

68
00:02:57,173 --> 00:02:59,010
It's not. Breakfast?

69
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,941
That's the problem with secrets -

70
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:07,567
like misery, they love company.

71
00:03:07,718 --> 00:03:11,653
No, look, I told you people
- I'm not coming in for a counseling session.

72
00:03:11,836 --> 00:03:13,571
I know all my options.

73
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:18,547
Uh, well, I made my decision, and
I made my appointment.

74
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,175
I'll be there on the 16th.

75
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:24,611
They pile up and up until
they take over everything...

76
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:25,829
I paged you last night.

77
00:03:26,222 --> 00:03:27,302
I wasn't on call.

78
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,785
That's not why I paged you.

79
00:03:33,104 --> 00:03:34,569
You could give me your home number.

80
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:38,583
Um, Burke...

81
00:03:42,006 --> 00:03:43,636
Uh, I gotta go.

82
00:03:44,235 --> 00:03:46,539
...Until you don't have room for anything else...

83
00:03:51,828 --> 00:03:56,856
...until you're so full of secrets,
you feel like you're going to burst.

84
00:03:57,021 --> 00:03:59,002
I had a really good time the other night.

85
00:03:59,052 --> 00:03:59,891
Yeah, me too.

86
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:03,028
Are you, uh, feeling okay and everything?

87
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:03,936
I'm good.

88
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:06,962
Great, now that I got to see you. Why?

89
00:04:07,055 --> 00:04:09,318
Oh, no reason. I'm good, too, you know?

90
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:10,572
Really good.

91
00:04:11,238 --> 00:04:11,985
You know.

92
00:04:12,994 --> 00:04:15,646
But um... a little itchy.

93
00:04:15,807 --> 00:04:16,405
George.

94
00:04:17,361 --> 00:04:17,869
Hey.

95
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:18,663
Olivia.

96
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,132
Hi, Dr. Stevens.

97
00:04:20,619 --> 00:04:22,236
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

98
00:04:23,254 --> 00:04:23,946
Bye.

99
00:04:28,595 --> 00:04:29,302
Yeah.

100
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:31,139
She's into me.

101
00:04:32,194 --> 00:04:34,335
Way to go, George. She's cute.

102
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:37,073
So, this morning, you really weren't...

103
00:04:37,162 --> 00:04:39,471
Anytime you want to apologize.

104
00:04:40,203 --> 00:04:42,852
Then what were you doing in
the bathroom for so long?

105
00:04:43,378 --> 00:04:44,305
I have to go.

106
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:05,133
I know I'm pretty to look at
and all, George, but back up.

107
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:07,217
I need to ask you something.

108
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:08,701
I'm waiting.

109
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:15,942
I seem to be having this skin...
thing going on, like a rash, really,

110
00:05:15,993 --> 00:05:20,406
and I think I know what it is, but I
can't get close enough to tell for sure.

111
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:21,277
Let's see it.

112
00:05:22,024 --> 00:05:25,914
It's kind of located in an, um, you know, private -

113
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:29,684
You're a doctor, George. It's called a penis.
You have a rash on your penis?

114
00:05:31,368 --> 00:05:32,867
I think I can describe it.

115
00:05:33,186 --> 00:05:35,710
Um, it's k- red.

116
00:05:35,777 --> 00:05:38,664
Just come on. Just show me your
junk so we can get this over with.

117
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:56,702
So?

118
00:06:00,598 --> 00:06:02,538
Dude, you've got syphilis.

119
00:06:46,063 --> 00:06:48,863
Patient presented with
abdominal pain and blood in his urine.

120
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:53,759
Once his work-up came back unrevealing,
the urologist suggested a cystoscopy.

121
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,532
Reason?

122
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,352
To get a look inside the bladder.

123
00:06:57,445 --> 00:06:59,016
I appreciate you doing this, Preston.

124
00:06:59,882 --> 00:07:01,899
I know this is a little out of your field.

125
00:07:02,012 --> 00:07:02,939
That's not a problem.

126
00:07:03,052 --> 00:07:04,772
It gives my interns something to do.

127
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:07,188
I have a feeling you keep them plenty busy.

128
00:07:07,357 --> 00:07:09,200
We were in the same frat at Tulane.

129
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:13,303
It's gone from torturing pledges
to torturing interns. Am I right?

130
00:07:13,373 --> 00:07:15,855
Be very careful how you two answer that.

131
00:07:17,362 --> 00:07:18,944
I could tell some stories.

132
00:07:19,014 --> 00:07:21,238
Bill, you have a camera snaking up your mojo.

133
00:07:21,335 --> 00:07:22,533
It's not the time to cross me.

134
00:07:22,594 --> 00:07:24,436
It isn't anything too serious?

135
00:07:24,822 --> 00:07:26,680
That's what this procedure will tell us.

136
00:07:27,085 --> 00:07:30,470
You don't worry about anything
but growing my godson in there.

137
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,924
He kicks like you wouldn't believe.

138
00:07:31,996 --> 00:07:33,458
A badass, just like his father.

139
00:07:34,873 --> 00:07:36,239
Move a little to the right.

140
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:37,795
Your other right.

141
00:07:38,487 --> 00:07:39,316
There.

142
00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:40,802
What do you see? What is it?

143
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,177
Could be any number of things.

144
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,342
O'Malley, take a biopsy of the mass.

145
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,990
Dr. Karev, schedule a C.T.

146
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,640
Let's not worry until we have to.

147
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,970
There's too much damage.

148
00:08:00,851 --> 00:08:04,701
We'll have to remove most of the
colon instead of a local resection.

149
00:08:10,385 --> 00:08:11,357
You gotta push it up.

150
00:08:23,877 --> 00:08:26,820
More suture. And what's with
these damn lights in here?

151
00:08:35,023 --> 00:08:38,734
Mr. Franklin, how long has
your abdomen been like this?

152
00:08:39,124 --> 00:08:41,012
It's been getting bigger for a while.

153
00:08:41,197 --> 00:08:43,224
I told him there was something wrong.

154
00:08:43,338 --> 00:08:46,322
No one gets fat like this so fast. I told him.

155
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:47,648
Everybody told him.

156
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,277
He has dullness to percussion and spider angiomas.

157
00:08:50,342 --> 00:08:51,396
What's all that mean?

158
00:08:51,494 --> 00:08:54,034
We have to run some tests.

159
00:08:54,228 --> 00:08:55,364
Great.

160
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:57,238
What's that gonna cost us this time?

161
00:08:57,432 --> 00:08:59,092
Alice, don't.

162
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:07,057
Hi, uh, results for George O'Malley?

163
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:11,299
I don't see it here. What's the patient's name?

164
00:09:11,353 --> 00:09:13,751
O'Malley, George. Look, it's
just a simple blood test.

165
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:14,984
Here you go.

166
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:16,115
Thank you.

167
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:25,218
Franklin, Jordan. I need these back asap.

168
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:26,268
What a shocker.

169
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:29,223
Hey, what did you get, something good?

170
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:31,241
Syphilis? That's not surgical. Who has syphilis?

171
00:09:34,954 --> 00:09:36,027
Excuse us. Sorry.

172
00:09:38,506 --> 00:09:39,657
You have syphilis?

173
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:49,688
I don't know how this happened.

174
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:51,010
Of course you do.

175
00:09:51,141 --> 00:09:54,265
- Olivia must really be getting around.
- She's not like that.

176
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:55,684
It's a new millennium, George.

177
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,103
The only people who aren't like that
are the amish and, apparently, you.

178
00:09:59,318 --> 00:10:00,200
You don't know.

179
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:02,427
Maybe I've been sleeping around.

180
00:10:02,554 --> 00:10:04,127
Maybe I got ladies.

181
00:10:05,426 --> 00:10:06,364
Shut up.

182
00:10:07,214 --> 00:10:08,222
What am I gonna do?

183
00:10:08,305 --> 00:10:10,869
It's no biggie. A couple doses of
penicillin will knock it right out.

184
00:10:10,935 --> 00:10:12,318
What am I gonna do about Olivia?

185
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:14,059
For starters, stop sleeping with her,

186
00:10:14,126 --> 00:10:16,103
unless you want that thing to fall off.

187
00:10:16,634 --> 00:10:20,981
Okay, that is twice that you have trash-talked
the girl that I could one day potentially -

188
00:10:21,186 --> 00:10:23,201
well, not love, but like a whole lot.

189
00:10:24,402 --> 00:10:26,434
If she gave it to you, you have to tell her.

190
00:10:26,783 --> 00:10:27,659
Three.

191
00:10:27,858 --> 00:10:29,660
Fine. She didn't give it to you.

192
00:10:29,747 --> 00:10:31,636
She was a virgin when you met.

193
00:10:32,097 --> 00:10:34,022
You still have to tell her so she can get tested.

194
00:10:34,094 --> 00:10:35,149
Oh, yeah?

195
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:36,971
How am I gonna tell her?

196
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,033
"Uh, hey, Olivia. How you doing?

197
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:42,516
By the way, I got the syph. How about you?"

198
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,633
Maybe not quite like that.

199
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:46,474
No, it's good advice, really good advice.
Thank you very much.

200
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:47,749
Retract here.

201
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,092
Oh! This just isn't holding.

202
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,123
Give me a bigger retractor, please.

203
00:10:56,181 --> 00:10:57,954
- Sorry Doctor.
- It wasn't you.

204
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:02,940
Dr. Bailey, you can finish this.

205
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:07,247
Uh, thank you, chief. I appreciate the opportunity.

206
00:11:21,062 --> 00:11:24,490
I gotta say, George, I didn't
think you had it in you.

207
00:11:25,122 --> 00:11:26,861
It's always the quiet ones.

208
00:11:27,362 --> 00:11:29,155
- So, who's the woman?
- None of your business.

209
00:11:29,282 --> 00:11:30,281
Oh, come on.

210
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:32,540
Who gave you the cooties on the playground?

211
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,314
You must have had something
like this before, right?

212
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,710
I never talk about my penis with other men.

213
00:11:40,526 --> 00:11:43,133
I don't n-either, normally.

214
00:11:47,817 --> 00:11:48,821
We better get Burke.

215
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:56,419
Mr. Franklin?

216
00:11:58,472 --> 00:12:00,879
You have a condition known as ascites.

217
00:12:00,976 --> 00:12:02,799
Oh, my god. I knew it was terrible.

218
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:05,230
It just means there's fluid
in the peritoneal cavity -

219
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:07,253
the abdomen.

220
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:10,811
And the swelling is pressing against your lungs,
which is why you're having trouble breathing.

221
00:12:10,893 --> 00:12:13,300
In your case, it looks like
a symptom of liver disease.

222
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,788
And it all comes together.

223
00:12:15,895 --> 00:12:17,288
Alice, not now.

224
00:12:18,225 --> 00:12:19,542
Is there something we should know?

225
00:12:22,766 --> 00:12:24,282
I drink a bit.

226
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:26,413
That's the understatement of the year.

227
00:12:26,607 --> 00:12:28,188
That's enough out of you!

228
00:12:28,292 --> 00:12:30,186
Hey! I'm only here for mom,

229
00:12:30,392 --> 00:12:32,910
to make sure you don't pull any of your usual crap.

230
00:12:36,392 --> 00:12:40,124
There's definitely a growth protruding
into the bladder, but look at the edges.

231
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:41,282
I don't think it's a tumor.

232
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:43,048
Kind of shaped like an ovary.

233
00:12:43,134 --> 00:12:45,879
That the flip answer you're gonna
give your patient, Dr. Karev?

234
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:49,227
This is one of my oldest friends. You
might want to take this seriously.

235
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,425
I'm sorry, sir.

236
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:51,414
You better be.

237
00:12:52,924 --> 00:12:54,322
I got the rest of the labs back.

238
00:12:54,393 --> 00:12:56,918
They did a chromosome analysis of the tissue.

239
00:12:57,383 --> 00:12:58,797
You won't believe this.

240
00:13:04,598 --> 00:13:06,016
Bill has an ovary?

241
00:13:14,618 --> 00:13:17,937
Um, according to his daughter,
Mr. Franklin is a heavy drinker.

242
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:20,624
Six to eight drinks a day, an
alcoholic by any standard.

243
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:21,433
Protocol?

244
00:13:21,517 --> 00:13:22,626
Schedule a paracentesis.

245
00:13:22,683 --> 00:13:23,276
Reason?

246
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:25,252
Draining the fluid will relieve the pressure.

247
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:27,628
Good, but don't schedule it. Do it.

248
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,830
You want us to do the procedure?

249
00:13:29,907 --> 00:13:30,896
You've seen one, right?

250
00:13:30,972 --> 00:13:31,669
Absolutely.

251
00:13:31,755 --> 00:13:33,283
Well, now do one.

252
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,834
I've never seen one.

253
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:38,357
You're about to.

254
00:13:39,023 --> 00:13:39,840
Oh, my god.

255
00:13:41,137 --> 00:13:42,719
God, an ovary.

256
00:13:42,815 --> 00:13:45,268
It gives new meaning to the term "metrosexual."

257
00:13:46,823 --> 00:13:47,704
Hi, George.

258
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:48,749
Olivia.

259
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:49,928
What am I, invisible?

260
00:13:50,572 --> 00:13:51,330
Alex.

261
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:53,849
You go ahead. I'll catch up with you later.

262
00:14:03,505 --> 00:14:05,175
About time I got you alone today.

263
00:14:10,027 --> 00:14:12,193
- Olivia -
- What time is your shift done?

264
00:14:12,255 --> 00:14:15,020
Because mine's over at 8:00, and I
thought maybe you could come over.

265
00:14:15,148 --> 00:14:16,745
Olivia! I need to tell you something.

266
00:14:17,115 --> 00:14:17,938
What's wrong?

267
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:20,995
Are you breaking up with me?

268
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:21,912
What? No.

269
00:14:22,157 --> 00:14:24,144
Oh, no, really, no.

270
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:25,025
It's just...

271
00:14:27,052 --> 00:14:31,763
Okay, you're the only person that
I've been with in a long time.

272
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,229
I mean, not unusually long or anything, you know?

273
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:37,320
Just a normal amount of long time.

274
00:14:37,436 --> 00:14:40,416
But it wouldn't matter to me if
you've been with someone else.

275
00:14:41,106 --> 00:14:42,264
Maybe you have?

276
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:46,180
I'm not accusing you of anything
or, you know, judging you

277
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:49,339
or handing out scarlet letters
or anything, you know?

278
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:52,222
You're a woman, you know?

279
00:14:52,617 --> 00:14:53,742
A very attractive woman.

280
00:14:53,824 --> 00:14:55,750
Of course you've been with other men.

281
00:14:55,818 --> 00:14:57,834
I mean, not that you've been with a lot of men.

282
00:14:57,915 --> 00:15:00,179
- It's not like you're a prostitute or -
- A prostitute?

283
00:15:00,245 --> 00:15:03,175
No! Not a - not a prostitute.

284
00:15:03,517 --> 00:15:06,779
No, the opposite of a prostitute - a lady.

285
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:08,863
You're very ladylike.

286
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:11,223
I mean, you're very bendy, but...

287
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:13,424
- George, breathe.
- Okay.

288
00:15:13,531 --> 00:15:15,298
It's just - okay, here's the thing.

289
00:15:16,138 --> 00:15:17,736
I really like you, Olivia.

290
00:15:18,703 --> 00:15:19,978
I like you a lot.

291
00:15:20,316 --> 00:15:22,302
Well, I like you, too.

292
00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:28,042
I have syphilis.

293
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:46,493
That could have gone better.

294
00:16:02,986 --> 00:16:04,267
You dropped a retractor.

295
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:06,073
Fine.

296
00:16:08,162 --> 00:16:12,299
A few weeks ago, I was operating, and the
vision in my right eye became blurry.

297
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:13,963
After a few hours, it was fine.

298
00:16:14,046 --> 00:16:15,044
It's come back again.

299
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:16,314
Did you have it checked out?

300
00:16:16,426 --> 00:16:18,013
The examination was normal.

301
00:16:18,091 --> 00:16:20,687
My ophthalmologist tells me
I'm just getting older...

302
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:24,567
but you know what a decline
in my visual acuity can mean.

303
00:16:25,023 --> 00:16:26,405
I'll set up some tests.

304
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,270
Shep...

305
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,207
I know how the rumor mill runs around here.

306
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,701
Let's just keep this to ourselves.

307
00:16:34,485 --> 00:16:35,416
Absolutely.

308
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:37,266
Yeah.

309
00:16:43,638 --> 00:16:45,158
Do you think she's talking about me?

310
00:16:45,222 --> 00:16:47,207
She's absolutely talking about you.

311
00:16:48,376 --> 00:16:49,435
Dude, that's a good thing.

312
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:50,935
No. No, it's not.

313
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:52,307
Georgie, get a clue.

314
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:54,883
Syphilis is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

315
00:16:55,246 --> 00:16:56,992
In their eyes, you're a player.

316
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:01,072
Hey, syph boy.

317
00:17:02,175 --> 00:17:03,120
You told her?

318
00:17:03,387 --> 00:17:04,329
Just Cristina.

319
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:05,340
"Syph boy."

320
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,928
It's got a nice ring to it, kind
of like superboy, only diseased.

321
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,683
Izzie didn't have to say a word.

322
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:13,987
Around here, the only thing that
spreads faster than disease is gossip.

323
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:15,122
That's not true.

324
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,806
Just 'cause Izzie can't keep her
mouth shut doesn't mean everyone...

325
00:17:17,857 --> 00:17:21,614
Hey George, how are you feeling?
Sorry about the syphilis.

326
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:24,313
Everyone in this hospital knows?

327
00:17:25,506 --> 00:17:27,186
Knows you're a player.

328
00:17:27,554 --> 00:17:28,506
You're disturbed.

329
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:29,357
True.

330
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:31,214
Everybody's got a secret.

331
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:32,941
Be glad yours is out in the open.

332
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:34,701
Oh, yeah, Alex? What's yours?

333
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:36,822
You show me yours, and I'll show you mine.

334
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,265
I'll bet she's got some serious and
kinky skeletons in the closet.

335
00:17:44,353 --> 00:17:46,216
What's in my closet is none of your business.

336
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:49,146
Well, I don't have any secrets. My life is boring.

337
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,034
Everybody's got something to hide.

338
00:18:00,796 --> 00:18:02,903
Well, the mass we found is not a tumor.

339
00:18:03,087 --> 00:18:05,784
Well, that's good, right? Anything's
got to be better than cancer.

340
00:18:05,933 --> 00:18:07,726
That's where it gets a little tricky.

341
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:13,446
The chromosomal tests have revealed that your
body contains DNA from two different embryos

342
00:18:13,502 --> 00:18:16,487
that merged in the womb at the
very beginning of development.

343
00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:18,391
In rare cases such as yours,

344
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:21,416
the condition can produce gonadal hermaphroditism.

345
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:25,697
I'm hearing scary words here, Preston,
you know, pay-cable kind of words.

346
00:18:25,774 --> 00:18:26,654
In english,

347
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,318
the mass in your bladder is an ovary.

348
00:18:30,438 --> 00:18:32,250
Don't worry. We're gonna remove it.

349
00:18:32,885 --> 00:18:36,266
We have an excellent
gynecological surgeon on staff.

350
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:39,342
You're telling me I'm a guy with an ovary?

351
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:41,507
It's simply a quirk of nature, man.

352
00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:49,367
What am I gonna tell Holly?

353
00:18:49,449 --> 00:18:50,736
That you're gonna be fine.

354
00:18:51,815 --> 00:18:53,329
I'm still a man, right?

355
00:18:53,596 --> 00:18:55,926
A man's man, a kappa man.

356
00:18:56,223 --> 00:18:59,510
I mean... you know, my sex life.

357
00:18:59,643 --> 00:19:01,225
Been having any problems?

358
00:19:02,137 --> 00:19:04,747
Was it my very pregnant wife that give it away?

359
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,562
Come on, man, don't worry.

360
00:19:09,196 --> 00:19:11,535
You never knew it was there. You
won't miss it when it's gone.

361
00:19:15,648 --> 00:19:17,429
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

362
00:19:17,536 --> 00:19:20,332
It's a shot of penicillin, George.
Be grateful I'm even doing this.

363
00:19:20,362 --> 00:19:22,406
I'm about to see more of you than I ever wanted to.

364
00:19:22,806 --> 00:19:24,279
I'll be fighting nightmares for a week.

365
00:19:24,358 --> 00:19:25,371
Okay, you know what? Forget this.

366
00:19:25,446 --> 00:19:27,029
Do you want to get rid of the syph or not?

367
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,617
Just shut up and drop them.

368
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:33,050
I cannot believe this.

369
00:19:33,969 --> 00:19:35,381
Meredith, go away!

370
00:19:35,857 --> 00:19:38,566
Oh, George, I'll give you some moral support.

371
00:19:38,622 --> 00:19:40,530
No. No moral support.

372
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:42,047
I'm indisposed here.

373
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:45,282
George, it's not a big deal.

374
00:19:45,523 --> 00:19:47,115
And you have a cute butt.

375
00:19:47,234 --> 00:19:48,487
I have a cute butt, too.

376
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:49,230
You want to see?

377
00:19:49,349 --> 00:19:51,360
Oh, get out. You're doing it wrong.

378
00:19:51,488 --> 00:19:52,431
Be my guest.

379
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:53,706
What - Alex.

380
00:19:54,196 --> 00:19:54,919
Alex.

381
00:19:59,198 --> 00:19:59,932
Hey!

382
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:01,514
What are we doing here?

383
00:20:02,138 --> 00:20:03,608
Breaking George's spirit.

384
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:05,169
Curing George’s syph.

385
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:07,344
I don't like needles.

386
00:20:07,428 --> 00:20:08,944
Good thing you became a doctor.

387
00:20:09,021 --> 00:20:09,931
Other side.

388
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,349
- Izzie?
- Yeah?

389
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:14,672
Mr. Franklin's procedure's been
scheduled for after lunch -

390
00:20:14,784 --> 00:20:15,768
What are we doing?

391
00:20:15,962 --> 00:20:20,182
We are saving George from a future
of festering sores and insanity.

392
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:21,304
Oh, cute butt.

393
00:20:21,446 --> 00:20:22,271
Told you.

394
00:20:22,358 --> 00:20:23,930
It is cute, like a baby's.

395
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:30,416
You know, I have spent hours, days, years,

396
00:20:30,585 --> 00:20:34,487
imagining myself half-naked
in a room with three women.

397
00:20:35,721 --> 00:20:37,451
The reality is so much better.

398
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,602
I think he's gonna cry.

399
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:44,240
Hi. It's Ms. Henry again.

400
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,592
Is this a better time?

401
00:20:45,658 --> 00:20:48,127
Sorry about this morning. I wasn't alone and -

402
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:49,516
What were you calling about?

403
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:53,031
I just wanted to remind you that
tonight's our monthly family dinner.

404
00:20:53,323 --> 00:20:56,482
You know, you haven't been to
any of our family functions.

405
00:20:56,928 --> 00:21:01,208
You have to understand. I'm a surgical
intern, so my time isn't my own.

406
00:21:01,317 --> 00:21:03,589
Our residents really respond to these events.

407
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:06,662
They always enjoy themselves, which is so rare.

408
00:21:06,734 --> 00:21:08,386
I think it's important you attend.

409
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:10,588
I'll be there.

410
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,984
I'll try to be there.

411
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,607
I'll definitely try.

412
00:21:16,077 --> 00:21:17,983
I've cleared some time for your M.R.I.

413
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,328
- Good. Let's get going.
- Okay.

414
00:21:19,728 --> 00:21:22,610
Uh... sorry to bother you with this, chief.

415
00:21:22,688 --> 00:21:25,365
We've got kind of a situation.

416
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,926
What now?

417
00:21:27,324 --> 00:21:31,111
Three interns, four residents, and six nurses

418
00:21:31,186 --> 00:21:36,582
on this surgical floor have been
diagnosed with... syphilis.

419
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:40,279
There are over 70,000 new cases every year.

420
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:45,549
Undiagnosed, syphilis can lead to
blindness, insanity, and death.

421
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:52,148
If you are having unprotected sex with
another member of the staff, get tested.

422
00:21:52,225 --> 00:21:54,192
This is not a request.

423
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:02,500
Patricia will now give you
a safe-sex demonstration.

424
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:09,653
When the time is right, and, gentlemen,
you'll all know when that time is,

425
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:13,252
carefully open the condom packet...

426
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,452
and roll it onto the banana.

427
00:22:16,566 --> 00:22:18,619
We should try and get down to do the M.R.I. now.

428
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,595
This isn't really a good time.

429
00:22:20,784 --> 00:22:22,606
If you want to do this without
anybody else knowing,

430
00:22:23,052 --> 00:22:23,994
you should do it now.

431
00:22:30,861 --> 00:22:31,832
Poor George.

432
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:32,913
Yeah.

433
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,684
You know, I think he really likes typhoid Mary.

434
00:22:36,472 --> 00:22:40,133
Well, not many budding relationships
survive a good dose of V.D.

435
00:22:41,858 --> 00:22:42,505
Yeah.

436
00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:45,407
Yeah.

437
00:22:45,503 --> 00:22:50,414
...gently peel off the condom
and dispose of it properly.

438
00:22:50,997 --> 00:22:54,854
With every fresh banana, always use a fresh condom.

439
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:26,700
You're avoiding me.

440
00:23:28,113 --> 00:23:30,859
I'm busy... at work. I-I'm working.

441
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:33,898
Why are you in this line?

442
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,883
It's the syphilis line.

443
00:23:37,344 --> 00:23:38,716
You don't need to be in this line.

444
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:39,754
I don't?

445
00:23:41,281 --> 00:23:42,250
There's no one else.

446
00:23:45,234 --> 00:23:46,217
That surprises you?

447
00:23:48,034 --> 00:23:49,290
Nothing surprises me.

448
00:23:52,028 --> 00:23:53,252
Do I need to be in this line?

449
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:56,872
No.

450
00:23:59,427 --> 00:24:00,523
- Okay.
- Okay.

451
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:03,344
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

452
00:24:03,518 --> 00:24:04,879
Mr. Franklin's prepped and ready.

453
00:24:04,997 --> 00:24:05,720
Excellent.

454
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:07,040
God, look at this line.

455
00:24:07,665 --> 00:24:09,192
Well, at least we don't have to stand in line.

456
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:11,797
That's the one good thing about the fact
neither of us is getting any, right?

457
00:24:15,464 --> 00:24:17,960
Mr. Franklin, we've given you a local anesthetic,

458
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:19,287
but you might feel some pressure.

459
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,535
Okay,

460
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:26,671
I'm ready.

461
00:24:26,937 --> 00:24:27,536
Grab the skin.

462
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:34,525
I'm in the peritoneal cavity.

463
00:24:39,905 --> 00:24:40,920
That fluid is bloody.

464
00:24:41,016 --> 00:24:41,999
Is it supposed to be bloody?

465
00:24:42,161 --> 00:24:43,664
You've done this before, right?

466
00:24:43,745 --> 00:24:45,231
- Of course.
- Millions of times.

467
00:24:46,914 --> 00:24:48,447
You're doing great, Mr. Franklin.

468
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:51,272
Okay, wait, wait.

469
00:24:53,363 --> 00:24:54,299
Okay, go.

470
00:25:00,372 --> 00:25:01,276
Good.

471
00:25:03,693 --> 00:25:04,933
Now all we have to do is wait.

472
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,847
You see that right there?

473
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:12,192
It's a tumor,

474
00:25:12,817 --> 00:25:14,636
and it's pressing against your optic nerve.

475
00:25:14,737 --> 00:25:15,575
Is it operable?

476
00:25:15,658 --> 00:25:16,585
Oh, definitely.

477
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:20,205
It does have its risks.

478
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,126
You mean I could lose my sight?

479
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,930
Just what I need - a syphilis outbreak and a tumor.

480
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,376
Well, it's probably unrelated.

481
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:32,304
All right, Derek, let's see
how good you really are.

482
00:25:33,748 --> 00:25:35,529
All right. I'll put a team together.

483
00:25:35,616 --> 00:25:36,815
All my people only.

484
00:25:37,348 --> 00:25:38,883
And I still want this kept under wraps.

485
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,942
The vultures will be circling soon enough.

486
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:42,170
Aren't I one of the vultures?

487
00:25:42,258 --> 00:25:44,086
Why do you think I want to keep an eye on you?

488
00:25:44,516 --> 00:25:46,497
Get going. We're doing this tonight.

489
00:25:46,747 --> 00:25:47,352
Right.

490
00:25:53,924 --> 00:25:54,689
You paged.

491
00:25:54,848 --> 00:25:57,172
Yeah, I need you to help me out
on something for the chief.

492
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,641
Can you keep a secret?

493
00:25:59,368 --> 00:26:00,623
Better than you think.

494
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:05,379
How much fluid can one body hold?

495
00:26:07,012 --> 00:26:10,305
There's a lot of fluid in there,
Mr. Franklin, but we're almost finished.

496
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,943
Mr. Franklin, are you sleeping?

497
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:17,709
Mr. Franklin?

498
00:26:18,517 --> 00:26:19,525
- He has no pulse.
- What?

499
00:26:19,603 --> 00:26:20,679
He has no pulse!

500
00:26:23,863 --> 00:26:25,859
Code blue. Code blue.

501
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:39,915
Nobody die just like that with no warning.

502
00:26:39,981 --> 00:26:41,886
There was blood in the tube when it first went in.

503
00:26:42,075 --> 00:26:43,720
What if it's our fault? What
if we did something wrong?

504
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:44,793
We didn't do anything wrong.

505
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:46,078
We did a textbook procedure.

506
00:26:48,713 --> 00:26:49,916
I checked your chart.

507
00:26:50,014 --> 00:26:51,171
You did everything by the book.

508
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:53,193
He died on our watch. We
must have missed something.

509
00:26:53,296 --> 00:26:56,086
You couldn't have known.
There was no history of heart problems.

510
00:26:56,175 --> 00:26:57,515
His death wasn't your fault.

511
00:26:57,734 --> 00:26:58,759
When's the autopsy?

512
00:26:58,857 --> 00:27:00,306
There isn't gonna be an autopsy.

513
00:27:00,724 --> 00:27:03,157
What? How are we supposed
to know the cause of death?

514
00:27:03,224 --> 00:27:07,434
It's going down as cardiopulmonary
arrest complicated by liver disease.

515
00:27:07,504 --> 00:27:08,394
But an autopsy would -

516
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:12,296
The family decided they didn't want an autopsy.

517
00:27:12,363 --> 00:27:15,691
- But Dr. Bailey -
- They don't want an autopsy. Let it go.

518
00:27:27,206 --> 00:27:30,912
How goes our special, supersecret,
silent, sunset surgery?

519
00:27:31,545 --> 00:27:32,721
I've been practicing that.

520
00:27:33,043 --> 00:27:34,743
You have too much time on your hands.

521
00:27:34,824 --> 00:27:38,138
Uh, tell the chief I'll be there. Just
let me know when and where. I'm in.

522
00:27:38,228 --> 00:27:38,884
Okay.

523
00:27:43,616 --> 00:27:44,481
Are you nervous?

524
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:45,792
It's a complicated surgery.

525
00:27:46,104 --> 00:27:49,389
I make one mistake, I end a fellow
surgeon's career, my mentor's career.

526
00:27:49,452 --> 00:27:51,322
Oh, no, I'm not nervous.

527
00:27:53,532 --> 00:27:54,711
So, just for the record...

528
00:27:55,084 --> 00:27:57,235
you'd tell me if I need to get tested, right?

529
00:27:57,854 --> 00:27:59,282
You think I have syphilis?

530
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,291
No, I don't.

531
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:02,380
It's just - we never made any rules or anything.

532
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:05,016
I mean, we never said,

533
00:28:05,206 --> 00:28:08,171
"we have rules", and I
wouldn't hold it against you.

534
00:28:08,242 --> 00:28:10,993
When would I have time to go out and get syphilis?

535
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:15,144
You're a handful enough as it is, and besides,
we're, like, practically a condom ad.

536
00:28:15,273 --> 00:28:17,388
But no more glow-in-the-dark ones.

537
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:19,421
You see? There's nothing to worry about.

538
00:28:20,233 --> 00:28:22,614
Maybe we should, you know, make some rules, I mean.

539
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:23,680
We should.

540
00:28:24,048 --> 00:28:24,771
Okay.

541
00:28:25,067 --> 00:28:25,876
Okay.

542
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,491
Just for the record...

543
00:28:30,095 --> 00:28:32,307
I liked the glow-in-the-dark ones.

544
00:28:32,569 --> 00:28:33,822
I bet you do.

545
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,190
That's the last of the ovarian material.

546
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:47,448
I just need to sew up the
perforation on the bladder wall.

547
00:28:50,725 --> 00:28:52,500
Is there a problem, Dr. Knox?

548
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,963
Well, you said this man's wife is pregnant?

549
00:28:55,188 --> 00:28:56,515
Due in five weeks. Why?

550
00:28:56,592 --> 00:28:59,100
Our patient has a blind vas deferens.

551
00:29:01,137 --> 00:29:02,105
Bill is sterile?

552
00:29:02,264 --> 00:29:03,534
And always has been.

553
00:29:05,096 --> 00:29:07,194
Then who got his wife pregnant?

554
00:29:14,265 --> 00:29:15,802
Sucks to be Bill right now.

555
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:18,075
How's Burke gonna tell him the baby's not his?

556
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,191
Burke's not gonna tell him.

557
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,516
He has to. They're friends.

558
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,807
Bill's better off not knowing.

559
00:29:21,874 --> 00:29:23,462
Do you think Holly knows Bill's not the father?

560
00:29:23,538 --> 00:29:24,320
Maybe, maybe not.

561
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:26,843
Bill should know his wife's cheating on him.

562
00:29:27,084 --> 00:29:30,706
I don't remember asking for your
opinions, so keep them to yourselves.

563
00:29:30,794 --> 00:29:31,812
Sorry, sir.

564
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,854
You're such a gossip.

565
00:29:39,703 --> 00:29:41,734
We know how confusing this must be,

566
00:29:41,827 --> 00:29:43,778
your husband dying so suddenly,

567
00:29:44,145 --> 00:29:46,431
but an autopsy will tell us why.

568
00:29:46,947 --> 00:29:50,040
So, you think we should do the autopsy?

569
00:29:50,198 --> 00:29:51,933
No, we just want this to be over.

570
00:29:52,021 --> 00:29:54,945
But don't you want to know
for certain what killed him?

571
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,592
My father was a mean drunk who couldn't hold a job.

572
00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:00,029
That's what killed him.

573
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,093
I understand that you're angry,

574
00:30:02,181 --> 00:30:06,019
but knowing for sure might
help give you some closure.

575
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:09,056
It was awfully sudden, Alice.

576
00:30:09,229 --> 00:30:09,963
Sudden?

577
00:30:10,889 --> 00:30:13,177
He's been killing himself for years.

578
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:14,779
He was a good man.

579
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:17,769
Maybe they're right.

580
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,470
Maybe we should do the autopsy.

581
00:30:19,547 --> 00:30:21,278
Mom, stop it.

582
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:22,731
He's dead.

583
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,898
It's finally over.

584
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,503
Alice, your father would have wanted -

585
00:30:28,563 --> 00:30:30,130
Who cares what he wanted?

586
00:30:30,974 --> 00:30:36,458
Can't we please just try and get out of this with
whatever shred of dignity this family has left?

587
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,831
You guys want to perform an unauthorized autopsy?

588
00:30:55,075 --> 00:30:58,582
I know you, Cristina. You do not
want to be known as the new 007.

589
00:30:58,664 --> 00:31:00,164
An autopsy clears your name.

590
00:31:01,081 --> 00:31:03,083
Cristina, no.

591
00:31:03,307 --> 00:31:04,572
What about Franklin's wife?

592
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:07,419
You saw the way she was looking at me.
She wants the autopsy.

593
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:09,150
She just didn't want to fight with her daughter.

594
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,456
She looked so sad.

595
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,746
Okay, Cristina Yang, licensed to kill.

596
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:19,436
Okay, I'm in.

597
00:31:20,006 --> 00:31:21,694
I am so not involved in this.

598
00:31:21,765 --> 00:31:22,996
Meredith, this is fight club.

599
00:31:23,061 --> 00:31:24,162
Nobody talks about it.

600
00:31:24,254 --> 00:31:24,843
Fine.

601
00:31:25,768 --> 00:31:27,091
We have to do it when Bailey's not around.

602
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:29,368
She's everywhere and knows everything.

603
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,952
We have to take our chances.

604
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:33,689
Bailey's got something tonight from 7:00 to 11:00.

605
00:31:33,751 --> 00:31:35,640
You two will be the last thing she's worried about.

606
00:31:35,723 --> 00:31:37,448
- How do you know that?
- What kind of something?

607
00:31:37,691 --> 00:31:40,510
Oh, I can't tell you that. It's fight club, too.

608
00:31:43,607 --> 00:31:46,034
If I'm missing out on a real
patient because of this,

609
00:31:46,117 --> 00:31:49,228
they're gonna call me 007 because I've killed you.

610
00:31:56,806 --> 00:31:57,564
How we doing?

611
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:58,973
Did you lock up the gallery?

612
00:31:59,132 --> 00:32:00,860
Don't worry. We're flying under the radar.

613
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:03,197
What did you put out there, the Midas rex?

614
00:32:03,305 --> 00:32:04,503
We've got it, chief.

615
00:32:04,595 --> 00:32:05,998
How much vancomycin is there?

616
00:32:06,084 --> 00:32:07,738
One gram, as ordered, sir.

617
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,257
You're not gonna be too liberal with those benzos?

618
00:32:10,334 --> 00:32:12,464
You know, doctors make the worst patients.

619
00:32:12,552 --> 00:32:14,347
You should just breathe in the happy gas.

620
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:16,176
Stop running my O.R.

621
00:32:17,789 --> 00:32:19,294
I've got you covered.

622
00:32:28,504 --> 00:32:29,406
We stole a body.

623
00:32:30,987 --> 00:32:32,057
We're body snatchers.

624
00:32:32,907 --> 00:32:34,970
What if somebody from the morgue
comes looking for Franklin?

625
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,576
Well, "A" it's in the middle of the night, and "B"

626
00:32:37,649 --> 00:32:40,500
the thing about being dead is
people stop looking for you.

627
00:32:41,325 --> 00:32:42,103
Okay.

628
00:32:44,055 --> 00:32:45,661
When's the last time you did an autopsy?

629
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:48,621
I took gross anatomy like you.
I'm just trying to remember.

630
00:32:48,713 --> 00:32:50,433
You know what? Hold on. Hold on. Wait.

631
00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:51,463
Hold on.

632
00:32:52,773 --> 00:32:53,940
You brought a textbook?

633
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:56,500
Uh, if we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it right.

634
00:33:01,538 --> 00:33:02,353
Okay.

635
00:33:04,897 --> 00:33:05,804
Okay, got it.

636
00:33:06,004 --> 00:33:06,822
You sure?

637
00:33:07,002 --> 00:33:08,953
It's not like we can kill him twice.

638
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:14,452
Let me cut.

639
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:15,921
You'll get your turn.

640
00:33:19,192 --> 00:33:20,713
You should really be using the 10 blade.

641
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:22,490
Will you stop backseat cutting?

642
00:33:22,566 --> 00:33:23,765
Go get the saw.

643
00:33:25,342 --> 00:33:28,511
Okay, I've sutured the drain in place.
The staples look fine.

644
00:33:28,577 --> 00:33:30,559
All right, we're done here.
Dr. Bailey, you want to wrap him?

645
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,903
Nice work, everybody, nicely done.

646
00:33:32,985 --> 00:33:33,626
Thanks.

647
00:33:33,703 --> 00:33:34,454
Good.

648
00:33:39,821 --> 00:33:41,894
Do you think the optic nerve is damaged?

649
00:33:42,472 --> 00:33:45,592
If it is, when he wakes up, he'll -

650
00:33:45,652 --> 00:33:46,559
He'll be blind?

651
00:33:47,554 --> 00:33:48,464
For how long?

652
00:33:49,002 --> 00:33:49,831
Forever.

653
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:52,150
Page Stevens and Yang.

654
00:33:52,226 --> 00:33:54,363
Tell them I want them covering your patients.

655
00:33:54,582 --> 00:33:57,818
I need you to stay and monitor the chief.

656
00:33:59,978 --> 00:34:04,347
Cristina and Izzie, um... I
think they're already swamped.

657
00:34:04,495 --> 00:34:05,401
With what?

658
00:34:05,529 --> 00:34:08,472
Labs - they had to check on some labs.

659
00:34:10,664 --> 00:34:12,804
Oh, you are lying.

660
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,354
I know you're lying.

661
00:34:15,452 --> 00:34:16,332
You know how I know?

662
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:17,771
'Cause you're a bad liar!

663
00:34:18,077 --> 00:34:19,614
I hate a bad liar.

664
00:34:24,307 --> 00:34:26,035
Take over for me.

665
00:34:26,362 --> 00:34:28,447
I know exactly where they are.

666
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:29,276
Take over.

667
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,551
Your whole relationship is a lie.

668
00:34:40,751 --> 00:34:41,886
We're happy.

669
00:34:42,076 --> 00:34:43,944
We've wanted a child for a long time.

670
00:34:44,067 --> 00:34:45,684
Why do you want to take this away from him?

671
00:34:45,747 --> 00:34:46,746
Does he know you've been cheating on him?

672
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:49,321
Preston, this is between Bill and me.

673
00:34:49,383 --> 00:34:51,542
The man has a right to know
that this isn't his child.

674
00:34:52,604 --> 00:34:54,942
Please, just let this go.

675
00:34:55,035 --> 00:34:56,176
Why can't you let this go?

676
00:34:56,268 --> 00:34:57,993
Because Bill is my best friend. That's why.

677
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,237
If you were really his friend,
you wouldn't do this.

678
00:35:00,288 --> 00:35:01,701
Holly, please! Tell him the truth!

679
00:35:01,777 --> 00:35:02,593
Why?

680
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,474
I'm not gonna ruin my life
because you think this is wrong.

681
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:06,386
Your life?

682
00:35:06,795 --> 00:35:07,906
What about his life?

683
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:09,571
What about this child's life?

684
00:35:10,195 --> 00:35:12,156
What Bill doesn't know won't hurt him.

685
00:35:14,926 --> 00:35:15,704
Fine.

686
00:35:17,373 --> 00:35:19,267
Maybe his friend won't tell him the truth,

687
00:35:20,313 --> 00:35:21,905
but I'm also his doctor,

688
00:35:22,217 --> 00:35:24,859
and his doctor is not going to lie to him.

689
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:34,653
I know, but something came up, an
important surgery, and I couldn't.

690
00:35:34,822 --> 00:35:36,849
I'm just sorry you couldn't
be there for your mother.

691
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:40,316
Ms. Henry, if my mother were
lucid, she would understand.

692
00:35:40,362 --> 00:35:41,376
She's a surgeon.

693
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,521
She's done this countless times.

694
00:35:43,798 --> 00:35:46,777
And besides, she doesn't even
know who I am anyway, so...

695
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:48,324
Today she did.

696
00:35:49,327 --> 00:35:50,106
What?

697
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:53,899
Your mother's been asking when her
daughter Meredith gets off from work.

698
00:35:56,752 --> 00:35:57,385
Hey.

699
00:35:59,721 --> 00:36:00,535
Hey.

700
00:36:01,267 --> 00:36:02,865
A lot of secret phone calls today.

701
00:36:09,474 --> 00:36:10,837
Yeah, it's my mother.

702
00:36:15,568 --> 00:36:16,884
She isn't traveling.

703
00:36:18,173 --> 00:36:19,653
She isn't writing a book.

704
00:36:21,082 --> 00:36:22,439
She isn't anything.

705
00:36:22,782 --> 00:36:24,364
I've been lying to everyone.

706
00:36:25,607 --> 00:36:26,431
Why?

707
00:36:28,096 --> 00:36:29,581
She has alzheimer's.

708
00:36:31,311 --> 00:36:32,843
- How advanced?
- Very.

709
00:36:33,206 --> 00:36:36,743
She's in a home, and I'm the only
one who even knows she's sick.

710
00:36:37,722 --> 00:36:40,374
I just don't know what to do anymore, you know?

711
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:05,472
Don't even tell me you're doing
what I think you're doing!

712
00:37:15,893 --> 00:37:20,722
Not only did you disregard the
family's wishes, you broke the law!

713
00:37:21,128 --> 00:37:23,022
You could be arrested for assault!

714
00:37:23,104 --> 00:37:24,671
Do you like jail?

715
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:28,691
The hospital could be sued! I
could lose my license, my job!

716
00:37:28,742 --> 00:37:30,166
I like my job!

717
00:37:30,237 --> 00:37:34,440
Did you think about any of this before you
started cutting open a poor man's body?

718
00:37:34,522 --> 00:37:37,140
I could seriously kick both your asses right now.

719
00:37:37,195 --> 00:37:38,767
Do you have anything to say?

720
00:37:41,148 --> 00:37:42,274
Look at his heart.

721
00:37:42,479 --> 00:37:44,071
It's huge!

722
00:37:44,153 --> 00:37:45,634
It's over 600 grams,

723
00:37:45,874 --> 00:37:47,799
and there's some kind of grainy material in it.

724
00:37:47,877 --> 00:37:49,084
We want to run some tests.

725
00:37:49,189 --> 00:37:50,902
Oh, now you want to run tests?

726
00:37:51,117 --> 00:37:52,969
At this point, what could it hurt?

727
00:37:54,665 --> 00:37:57,491
I hate both of you right now.

728
00:38:08,806 --> 00:38:09,605
Meredith...

729
00:38:10,819 --> 00:38:11,951
he's an attending.

730
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,630
You're an intern.

731
00:38:14,053 --> 00:38:15,088
You saw us?

732
00:38:16,108 --> 00:38:17,361
You can see.

733
00:38:19,539 --> 00:38:22,369
I'm gonna tell you what your
mother would say if she were here.

734
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,580
You're making a mistake -

735
00:38:25,856 --> 00:38:26,843
a big one.

736
00:38:29,122 --> 00:38:31,591
And I would tell my mother it's not a mistake.

737
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:37,705
We specifically said no autopsy.

738
00:38:38,195 --> 00:38:41,376
I understand why you're upset.

739
00:38:41,451 --> 00:38:42,557
You understand?

740
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:44,816
We're gonna get an attorney.

741
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:45,676
Come on, mom.

742
00:38:45,762 --> 00:38:47,243
We know what killed him.

743
00:38:47,437 --> 00:38:50,868
He had a blood condition known as hemachromatosis.

744
00:38:51,042 --> 00:38:54,734
The disease causes an excess amount
of iron to build up in the body,

745
00:38:54,836 --> 00:38:58,512
and that's what caused the heart
failure, not the paracentesis.

746
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:02,302
But I thought he was always so
sick 'cause of the drinking.

747
00:39:02,418 --> 00:39:05,342
And you never let him forget it... or me.

748
00:39:05,433 --> 00:39:07,154
- Mom...
- There's something else.

749
00:39:07,246 --> 00:39:08,654
The disease is genetic.

750
00:39:08,757 --> 00:39:10,221
You think Alice could have it, too?

751
00:39:10,298 --> 00:39:12,059
A simple blood test will tell us.

752
00:39:12,228 --> 00:39:16,513
If you have it, we'll have caught it early enough
to treat it before the condition becomes critical.

753
00:39:16,596 --> 00:39:20,434
Dr. Stevens and Dr. Yang may have saved your life.

754
00:39:25,994 --> 00:39:27,178
If you could just...

755
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:31,081
sign this consent form for the autopsy -

756
00:39:31,485 --> 00:39:33,010
just a formality.

757
00:39:38,106 --> 00:39:44,075
The thing people forget is how good it can
feel when you finally set secrets free.

758
00:39:47,045 --> 00:39:51,575
Whether good or bad, at least
they're out in the open...

759
00:39:52,052 --> 00:39:54,140
like it or not.

760
00:40:08,529 --> 00:40:09,446
About before -

761
00:40:09,529 --> 00:40:13,146
George, I want you to understand -

762
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:17,344
when we started dating, I was
already kind of seeing someone.

763
00:40:18,271 --> 00:40:20,382
I didn't know how much I'd like you,

764
00:40:20,641 --> 00:40:23,172
and when I realized, I broke
it off with the other guy -

765
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,096
Other guy?

766
00:40:25,974 --> 00:40:27,457
Who's the other guy?

767
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:33,616
You and Alex?

768
00:40:36,592 --> 00:40:37,990
You and Alex?!

769
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:40,139
You gave me syphilis?!

770
00:40:40,339 --> 00:40:41,153
George!

771
00:40:41,378 --> 00:40:42,330
George!

772
00:40:42,663 --> 00:40:44,031
George, back off!

773
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,290
Alex!

774
00:40:45,464 --> 00:40:46,082
George!

775
00:40:46,366 --> 00:40:47,491
Back off, Alex.

776
00:40:50,758 --> 00:40:52,806
And once your secrets are out in the open,

777
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:55,049
you don't have to hide behind them anymore.

778
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:01,156
- Long day.
- Yeah.

779
00:41:02,003 --> 00:41:06,031
Someone out there has a steak with your
name on it and maybe a bottle of wine.

780
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:08,781
This is why I keep you around.

781
00:41:09,348 --> 00:41:10,614
So, we need to talk.

782
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,545
Wine first, talk later.

783
00:41:13,277 --> 00:41:16,721
You trying to, uh, get me drunk
so you can take advantage of me?

784
00:41:17,715 --> 00:41:19,876
I think I like this rules thing.

785
00:41:21,073 --> 00:41:21,806
Me too.

786
00:41:36,403 --> 00:41:38,062
Meredith, I am so sorry.

787
00:41:38,283 --> 00:41:43,004
The problem with secrets is even
when you think you're in control...

788
00:41:44,058 --> 00:41:45,051
Addison.

789
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:46,373
...You're not.

790
00:41:46,633 --> 00:41:48,000
What are you doing here?

791
00:41:48,201 --> 00:41:51,718
You'd know if you'd bothered to
return any one of my phone calls.

792
00:41:52,737 --> 00:41:54,825
Hi. I'm Addison Shepherd.

793
00:41:57,411 --> 00:41:58,301
Shepherd?

794
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:02,351
And you must be the woman who's
been screwing my husband.
