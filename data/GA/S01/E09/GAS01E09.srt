1
00:00:01,312 --> 00:00:03,177
Previously on Grey's Anatomy.

2
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:04,299
How hot is the sex?

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:06,041
You know, some people would call this a relationship.

4
00:00:06,081 --> 00:00:08,547
It's just that I hardly know anything about you.

5
00:00:08,627 --> 00:00:09,849
We're having sex every night.

6
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,333
I think I deserve details.

7
00:00:11,493 --> 00:00:12,574
You have more details than us.

8
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:14,919
So it makes a hot shot doc leave a big apple for Seattle.

9
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,082
Thanks for the coffee.

10
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:20,472
Adoption?

11
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:21,333
Keeping the baby?

12
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,056
I know this is a difficult decision.

13
00:00:23,077 --> 00:00:23,716
I'm not interested.

14
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:25,039
I am not your sister!

15
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:26,722
I am a man!

16
00:00:26,742 --> 00:00:27,582
You need to get laid.

17
00:00:28,082 --> 00:00:29,225
See that nurse over there?

18
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:30,907
She's single, she's got red hair.

19
00:00:31,108 --> 00:00:32,009
Go ask her out.

20
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:33,149
Smooth moves, Doctor.

21
00:00:34,311 --> 00:00:34,853
Who is that?

22
00:00:35,192 --> 00:00:35,793
That's Dad.

23
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:37,076
What's her diagnosis?

24
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:37,936
Alzheimer's.

25
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:39,899
And she doesn't want anyone to know?

26
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,323
I'm the only person she'll allow to see her.

27
00:00:48,326 --> 00:00:50,529
Secrets can't hide in science.

28
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,953
Medicine has a way of exposing the lies.

29
00:00:55,395 --> 00:00:59,378
Within the walls of the hospital, the truth is stripped bare.

30
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:09,790
How we keep our secrets outside the hospital, well, that's a little different.

31
00:01:11,352 --> 00:01:13,054
George, you locked the door.

32
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,135
I need to take a shower.

33
00:01:15,177 --> 00:01:16,257
I'll be out in a minute.

34
00:01:17,302 --> 00:01:18,043
What are you doing in there?

35
00:01:18,403 --> 00:01:20,846
It's private.

36
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:21,007
Oh.

37
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:22,049
Oh, God.

38
00:01:22,088 --> 00:01:22,509
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:23,129
I get it.

40
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:24,531
I didn't mean to interrupt.

41
00:01:24,953 --> 00:01:25,914
No, it's not that.

42
00:01:26,515 --> 00:01:27,096
It's OK, Dick.

43
00:01:27,115 --> 00:01:27,516
Your time.

44
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:30,600
I am not doing what you think I'm doing.

45
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,281
You know what?

46
00:01:31,302 --> 00:01:32,683
There's really no need to explain.

47
00:01:32,703 --> 00:01:33,103
I'll wait.

48
00:01:33,123 --> 00:01:34,887
You just finish.

49
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:36,829
No, I'm coming.

50
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,691
I'm coming out.

51
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:39,253
One thing is certain.

52
00:01:40,194 --> 00:01:45,721
Whatever it is we're trying to hide, we're never ready for that moment when the truth gets naked.

53
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:50,069
This is Miss Henry from the nursing home.

54
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:51,730
I'm calling about your mother.

55
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:52,792
Is she all right?

56
00:01:53,173 --> 00:01:54,194
Oh, it's nothing like that.

57
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:55,655
Can I call you later, then?

58
00:01:56,376 --> 00:02:00,721
Uh, I just wanted to... I have to go.

59
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,923
Oh, my God.

60
00:02:01,942 --> 00:02:03,805
Who is calling you at this hour?

61
00:02:04,906 --> 00:02:05,686
It's the wrong number.

62
00:02:11,593 --> 00:02:12,974
There's no reason to be ashamed.

63
00:02:13,094 --> 00:02:14,637
It's normal, healthy even.

64
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:17,159
Well, I'm not ashamed, because I wasn't doing anything.

65
00:02:17,831 --> 00:02:18,492
I don't have to.

66
00:02:18,532 --> 00:02:19,274
I have a girlfriend.

67
00:02:19,794 --> 00:02:21,075
An imaginary girlfriend?

68
00:02:22,858 --> 00:02:24,240
An actual girlfriend.

69
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:24,980
You know what?

70
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:25,882
It's no big deal.

71
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:26,943
You don't have to lie.

72
00:02:27,204 --> 00:02:27,584
I get it.

73
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:28,725
You have needs.

74
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:32,890
What is going on out here?

75
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:33,651
Nothing.

76
00:02:35,193 --> 00:02:35,533
Nothing?

77
00:02:36,536 --> 00:02:36,975
Nothing.

78
00:02:38,798 --> 00:02:41,342
He's freaked out because I caught him playing with little Jimmy and the twins.

79
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:42,663
I have a girlfriend.

80
00:02:43,304 --> 00:02:44,025
OK.

81
00:02:55,497 --> 00:02:56,277
Aren't you gonna get that?

82
00:02:56,298 --> 00:02:57,057
I'm over at the hospital.

83
00:02:57,438 --> 00:02:57,838
It's not.

84
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:58,840
Breakfast?

85
00:03:02,343 --> 00:03:03,784
That's the problem with secrets.

86
00:03:04,605 --> 00:03:07,388
Like misery, they love company.

87
00:03:07,968 --> 00:03:11,592
No, look, I told you people I'm not coming in for a counseling session.

88
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:13,454
I know all my options.

89
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:18,739
Yeah, uh, well, I made my decision and I made my appointment.

90
00:03:18,838 --> 00:03:20,020
I'll be there on the 16th.

91
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:24,745
They pile up and up until they take over everything.

92
00:03:24,825 --> 00:03:25,787
I paged you last night.

93
00:03:26,508 --> 00:03:27,569
Oh, I wasn't on the call.

94
00:03:29,312 --> 00:03:33,276
That's not why I paged you.

95
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:38,544
You could give me your home number.

96
00:03:38,905 --> 00:03:42,889
Um, Burke.

97
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:43,591
I gotta go.

98
00:03:43,711 --> 00:03:46,615
Until you don't have room for anything else.

99
00:03:51,926 --> 00:03:56,973
Until you're so full of secrets, you feel like you're going to burst.

100
00:03:57,353 --> 00:03:59,235
I had a really good time the other night.

101
00:03:59,254 --> 00:04:00,896
Yeah, me too.

102
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:03,300
Uh, you, uh, feeling okay and everything?

103
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,360
I'm good.

104
00:04:04,381 --> 00:04:04,781
You're great.

105
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:06,802
Now that I got to see you, why?

106
00:04:07,304 --> 00:04:07,824
Oh, no reason.

107
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:08,564
I'm good, too.

108
00:04:09,747 --> 00:04:13,050
You know, really good.

109
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:13,251
You know.

110
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,491
But, um...

111
00:04:14,826 --> 00:04:15,568
A little itchy.

112
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,750
George.

113
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:18,089
Hey.

114
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:18,490
Olivia.

115
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,312
Hi, Dr. Stevens.

116
00:04:20,973 --> 00:04:23,776
I'll see you later.

117
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:26,959
OK.

118
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,862
Bye.

119
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:29,221
Yeah.

120
00:04:30,564 --> 00:04:31,144
She's into me.

121
00:04:32,326 --> 00:04:33,086
Way to go, George.

122
00:04:33,487 --> 00:04:34,026
She's cute.

123
00:04:35,148 --> 00:04:36,730
So this morning you really weren't?

124
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:39,173
Any time you want to apologize.

125
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:42,516
Then what were you doing in the bathroom for so long?

126
00:04:43,536 --> 00:04:44,158
I have to go.

127
00:05:02,346 --> 00:05:04,870
I know I'm pretty to look at and all, George, but back up.

128
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,052
I need to ask you something.

129
00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:08,454
I'm waiting.

130
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:15,903
OK, I seem to be having this skin thing going on, like a rash, really.

131
00:05:16,064 --> 00:05:20,129
And I think I know what it is, but I can't get close enough to tell for sure.

132
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:22,250
Let's see it.

133
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:25,995
It's kind of located in a private.

134
00:05:26,016 --> 00:05:26,656
You're Dr. George.

135
00:05:26,696 --> 00:05:27,456
It's called a penis.

136
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:29,620
You have a rash on your penis?

137
00:05:31,473 --> 00:05:32,595
I think I can describe it.

138
00:05:33,315 --> 00:05:35,559
Um, it's... red.

139
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:52,605
Look, let's just... Come on, just show me your junk so we can get this over with.

140
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,091
So?

141
00:06:00,615 --> 00:06:02,509
Dude, you've got syphilis.

142
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,353
Patient presented with abdominal pain and blood in his urine.

143
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:53,978
Once his workup came back unrevealing, the urologist suggested a cystoscopy.

144
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:55,379
Reason?

145
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,081
Let's get a look inside the bladder.

146
00:06:57,523 --> 00:07:00,165
Appreciate you doing this, Preston.

147
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:01,666
I know this is a little out of your field.

148
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:02,827
That's not a problem.

149
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,550
It gives my interns something to do.

150
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,992
I have a feeling you keep them plenty busy.

151
00:07:07,432 --> 00:07:08,874
We're in the same frat at Tulane.

152
00:07:09,574 --> 00:07:12,577
It's gone from torturing pledges to torturing interns.

153
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,057
Am I right?

154
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:15,560
Be very careful how you two answer that.

155
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:18,749
I could tell some stories.

156
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:21,312
Bill, you have a camera snaking up your mojo.

157
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,595
It's not the time to cross me.

158
00:07:22,615 --> 00:07:24,036
It isn't anything too serious.

159
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:26,199
That's what this procedure will tell us.

160
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,144
You don't worry about anything but growing my godson in there.

161
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:31,747
He kicks like you wouldn't believe.

162
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:33,149
Badass, just like his father.

163
00:07:35,052 --> 00:07:35,874
Move a little to the right.

164
00:07:36,954 --> 00:07:37,516
Your other right.

165
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:38,838
There.

166
00:07:39,678 --> 00:07:40,139
What do you see?

167
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,940
What is it?

168
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,812
Could be any number of things.

169
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:44,975
O'Malley, take a biopsy of the mass.

170
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:46,797
Dr. Karev, schedule a CT.

171
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:57,749
Let's not worry until we have to.

172
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:58,709
That's too much damage.

173
00:08:01,252 --> 00:08:04,396
We'll have to remove most of the colon instead of a local resection.

174
00:08:23,884 --> 00:08:24,605
More suture.

175
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:26,447
And what's with these damn lights in here?

176
00:08:30,252 --> 00:08:38,224
Mr. Franklin, how long has your abdomen been like this?

177
00:08:39,205 --> 00:08:40,706
It's been getting bigger for a while.

178
00:08:40,726 --> 00:08:42,889
I told him there was something wrong.

179
00:08:43,431 --> 00:08:45,572
No one gets fat like this so fast.

180
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:46,134
I told him.

181
00:08:46,514 --> 00:08:47,495
Everybody told him.

182
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:50,067
He has dullness to percussion and spider angiomas.

183
00:08:50,368 --> 00:08:51,048
What's all that mean?

184
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:54,352
It means we have to admit your father and run some tests.

185
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:54,974
Great.

186
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:57,035
What's that going to cost us this time?

187
00:08:57,677 --> 00:08:58,697
Alice, don't.

188
00:09:05,726 --> 00:09:06,827
Results for George O'Malley.

189
00:09:10,232 --> 00:09:10,712
I don't see it here.

190
00:09:10,732 --> 00:09:11,453
What's the patient's name?

191
00:09:11,474 --> 00:09:12,115
O'Malley, George.

192
00:09:12,154 --> 00:09:14,398
Look, it's just a simple blood test.

193
00:09:14,418 --> 00:09:14,697
Here we go.

194
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:25,066
Franklin, Jordan, I need this back ASAP.

195
00:09:25,186 --> 00:09:25,947
What a shocker.

196
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:28,912
Hey, did you get something good?

197
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:29,734
Syphilis?

198
00:09:29,813 --> 00:09:30,414
It's not surgical.

199
00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:31,096
Who has syphilis?

200
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:35,583
Excuse us.

201
00:09:35,604 --> 00:09:35,945
Sorry.

202
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:41,073
You have syphilis?

203
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:49,383
I don't know how this happened.

204
00:09:50,004 --> 00:09:50,706
Of course you do.

205
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:52,951
God, Olivia must really be getting around.

206
00:09:52,971 --> 00:09:53,893
Olivia, she's not like that.

207
00:09:54,514 --> 00:09:55,658
It's a new millennium, George.

208
00:09:55,717 --> 00:09:58,684
The only people who aren't like that are the Amish, and apparently you.

209
00:09:59,385 --> 00:09:59,868
You don't know.

210
00:09:59,908 --> 00:10:02,173
Maybe I've been sleeping around.

211
00:10:02,693 --> 00:10:03,756
Maybe I got ladies.

212
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:06,403
Shut up.

213
00:10:07,312 --> 00:10:07,972
What am I gonna do?

214
00:10:08,332 --> 00:10:08,953
It's no biggie.

215
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:10,876
Couple doses of penicillin will knock it right out.

216
00:10:10,897 --> 00:10:12,119
What am I gonna do about Olivia?

217
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:13,880
Well, for starters, stop sleeping with her.

218
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,605
Unless you want that thing to fall off.

219
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,605
Okay, that is twice.

220
00:10:17,905 --> 00:10:22,852
That you've trash-talked the girl that I could one day potentially, well, not love, but like a whole lot.

221
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:26,138
If she gave it to you, you have to tell her.

222
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:27,259
Fine.

223
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,400
Fine.

224
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:29,461
She didn't give it to you.

225
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:31,124
She was a virgin when you met.

226
00:10:32,326 --> 00:10:33,888
You still have to tell her so she can get tested.

227
00:10:34,187 --> 00:10:34,788
Oh, yeah?

228
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,812
How am I gonna tell her?

229
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:39,807
Uh, hey, Olivia, how you doing?

230
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:41,649
By the way, I got the CIF.

231
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:42,350
How about you?

232
00:10:42,551 --> 00:10:43,572
Well, maybe not quite like that.

233
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:44,452
No, it's good advice.

234
00:10:44,493 --> 00:10:45,254
Really good advice.

235
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:46,034
Thank you very much.

236
00:10:46,956 --> 00:10:47,657
Retract here.

237
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:50,080
Here.

238
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,602
Oh, this just isn't holding.

239
00:10:52,623 --> 00:10:56,226
Give me a bigger retractor, please.

240
00:10:56,246 --> 00:10:57,028
Sorry, Doctor.

241
00:10:57,048 --> 00:10:57,567
It wasn't you.

242
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:02,614
Dr. Bailey, you can finish this.

243
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:05,741
Thank you, Chief.

244
00:11:05,761 --> 00:11:06,943
I appreciate the opportunity.

245
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:25,508
I gotta say, George, I didn't think you had it in you.

246
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:26,528
It's always the quiet ones.

247
00:11:27,471 --> 00:11:28,211
So who's the woman?

248
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:28,932
None of your business.

249
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:29,994
Oh, come on.

250
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,297
Who gave you the cooties on the playground?

251
00:11:32,868 --> 00:11:35,072
You must have had something like this before, right?

252
00:11:35,552 --> 00:11:37,417
I never talk about my penis with other men.

253
00:11:40,802 --> 00:11:42,706
I don't know, either, normally.

254
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:48,636
We better get Burke.

255
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,412
Mr. Franklin?

256
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,639
You have a condition known as ascites.

257
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,440
Oh, my god.

258
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,520
I knew it was terrible.

259
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:07,065
Just means there's fluid in the peritoneal cavity, the abdomen.

260
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:10,648
And the swelling is pressing against your lungs, which is why you're having trouble breathing.

261
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:12,909
In your case, it looks like a symptom of liver disease.

262
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:15,432
And it all comes together.

263
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:16,953
Alice, not now.

264
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:19,195
Is there something we should know?

265
00:12:19,235 --> 00:12:23,980
I drink a bit.

266
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,041
That's the understatement of the year.

267
00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:28,102
That's enough out of you.

268
00:12:28,302 --> 00:12:36,414
Hey, I'm only here for mom, to make sure you don't pull any of your usual crap.

269
00:12:36,434 --> 00:12:38,798
There's definitely a growth protruding into the bladder.

270
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:39,960
But look at the edges.

271
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,062
I don't think it's a tumor.

272
00:12:41,582 --> 00:12:42,683
Kind of shaped like an ovary.

273
00:12:43,184 --> 00:12:45,388
That the flip answer you're going to give your patient, Dr. Karev?

274
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:47,611
This is one of my oldest friends.

275
00:12:47,652 --> 00:12:49,033
You might want to take this seriously.

276
00:12:49,414 --> 00:12:50,096
I'm sorry, sir.

277
00:12:50,456 --> 00:12:50,937
You better be.

278
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,302
I got the rest of the labs back.

279
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:56,706
They did a chromosome analysis of the tissue.

280
00:12:57,731 --> 00:12:58,452
You won't believe this.

281
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,960
Bill has an ovary?

282
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:17,970
According to his daughter, Mr. Franklin is a heavy drinker.

283
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,171
Six to eight drinks a day.

284
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,552
An alcoholic by any standard.

285
00:13:20,732 --> 00:13:21,293
Protocol?

286
00:13:21,673 --> 00:13:22,614
Schedule a paracentesis.

287
00:13:22,774 --> 00:13:23,134
Reason?

288
00:13:23,575 --> 00:13:25,437
Draining the fluid will relieve the pressure from the lungs.

289
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:25,557
Good.

290
00:13:26,017 --> 00:13:26,998
But don't schedule it.

291
00:13:27,018 --> 00:13:27,739
Do it.

292
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,701
You want us to do the procedure?

293
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:30,844
You've seen one, right?

294
00:13:31,024 --> 00:13:31,544
Absolutely.

295
00:13:31,764 --> 00:13:34,568
Well, now do one.

296
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:36,552
I've never seen one.

297
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:38,114
You're about to.

298
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,258
Oh, my god.

299
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,880
God, an ovary.

300
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,063
Kind of gives new meaning to the term metrosexual.

301
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:47,547
Hi, George.

302
00:13:48,168 --> 00:13:48,528
Olivia.

303
00:13:49,068 --> 00:13:49,890
What am I, invisible?

304
00:13:50,812 --> 00:13:51,091
Alex.

305
00:13:52,313 --> 00:13:52,654
You go ahead.

306
00:13:52,674 --> 00:13:53,676
I'll catch up with you later.

307
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:09,409
About time I got you alone today.

308
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:10,753
Olivia.

309
00:14:10,793 --> 00:14:12,174
What time is your shift done?

310
00:14:12,195 --> 00:14:12,615
Olivia.

311
00:14:12,716 --> 00:14:15,442
Because mine's over at 8, and I thought maybe you could come over.

312
00:14:15,461 --> 00:14:17,125
Olivia, I need to tell you something.

313
00:14:17,144 --> 00:14:17,645
What's wrong?

314
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,712
You're breaking up with me?

315
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:21,453
What?

316
00:14:21,474 --> 00:14:21,674
No.

317
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:23,378
Oh, no, really.

318
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:24,860
No, it's just.

319
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:31,451
Okay, you're the only person that I've been with in a long time.

320
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:34,720
I mean, not unusually long or anything.

321
00:14:35,302 --> 00:14:37,147
Just a normal amount of a long time.

322
00:14:37,548 --> 00:14:41,278
But it wouldn't matter to me if you've been with someone else.

323
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,140
Maybe you have.

324
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:48,342
I'm not accusing you of anything or judging you or handing out scarlet letters or anything.

325
00:14:48,844 --> 00:14:50,807
You're a woman.

326
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,630
A very attractive woman.

327
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:55,674
Of course, you've been with other men.

328
00:14:55,735 --> 00:14:57,837
Not that you've been with a lot of men.

329
00:14:57,918 --> 00:14:59,581
It's not like you're a prostitute.

330
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,322
Prostitute?

331
00:15:00,341 --> 00:15:03,706
No, not a prostitute.

332
00:15:03,726 --> 00:15:05,889
No, opposite of a prostitute.

333
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:07,032
A lady.

334
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:09,336
You're very ladylike.

335
00:15:09,397 --> 00:15:13,484
I mean, you're very bendy, but... George, breathe.

336
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:13,605
Okay.

337
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:17,471
It's just, okay, here's the... I really like you, Olivia.

338
00:15:18,854 --> 00:15:19,635
I like you a lot.

339
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:21,879
Well, I like you too.

340
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:28,091
I have syphilis.

341
00:16:02,985 --> 00:16:03,947
You dropped a retractor.

342
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:05,849
Fine.

343
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:12,316
A few weeks ago, I was operating, and a vision in my right eye became blurry.

344
00:16:12,336 --> 00:16:14,077
After a few hours, it was fine.

345
00:16:14,097 --> 00:16:14,837
It's come back again.

346
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:15,938
Did you have it checked out?

347
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,721
Examination was normal.

348
00:16:18,162 --> 00:16:20,323
My ophthalmologist tells me I'm just getting older.

349
00:16:21,684 --> 00:16:24,128
But do you know what a decline in my visual acuity can mean?

350
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:26,049
I'll set up some tests.

351
00:16:27,631 --> 00:16:28,032
Sure.

352
00:16:29,277 --> 00:16:30,899
I know how the rumor mill runs around here.

353
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,421
Let's just keep this to ourselves.

354
00:16:34,741 --> 00:16:35,222
Absolutely.

355
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:43,711
Yeah.

356
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,072
Do you think she's talking about me?

357
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:46,933
She's absolutely talking about you.

358
00:16:48,495 --> 00:16:49,437
Dude, that's a good thing.

359
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:49,817
No.

360
00:16:50,157 --> 00:16:51,238
No, it's not.

361
00:16:51,258 --> 00:16:52,539
Georgia, get a clue.

362
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:55,582
Syphilis is the best thing that ever happened to you.

363
00:16:55,602 --> 00:16:57,124
In their eyes, you're a player.

364
00:17:00,158 --> 00:17:00,958
Hey, Sif boy.

365
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:02,860
You told her?

366
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:04,221
Just Christina.

367
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,383
Sif boy.

368
00:17:05,403 --> 00:17:06,324
It's got a nice ring to it.

369
00:17:06,423 --> 00:17:09,226
Kind of like Superboy, only diseased.

370
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:10,666
Izzy didn't have to say a word.

371
00:17:10,748 --> 00:17:14,030
Around here, the only thing that spreads faster than disease is gossip.

372
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:14,730
It's not true.

373
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:17,814
Just because Izzy can't keep her mouth shut doesn't mean everyone knows.

374
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:18,494
Hey, George.

375
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:19,935
How are you feeling?

376
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,136
Sorry about the syphilis.

377
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:25,601
Everybody in this hospital knows.

378
00:17:25,621 --> 00:17:26,842
Knows you're a player.

379
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,242
You're disturbed.

380
00:17:28,282 --> 00:17:28,983
True.

381
00:17:29,385 --> 00:17:31,188
Everybody's got a secret.

382
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,030
Just be glad yours is out in the open.

383
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:33,490
Oh, yeah?

384
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,432
Alex, what's yours?

385
00:17:35,193 --> 00:17:36,394
Show me yours, and I'll show you mine.

386
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:43,984
I bet you've got some seriously kinky skeletons in your closet.

387
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:45,807
What's in my closet is none of your business.

388
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:47,951
Well, I don't have any secrets.

389
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:48,872
My life is boring.

390
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:51,174
Everybody's got something to hide.

391
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:02,574
Well, the mass we found is not a tumor.

392
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:04,036
Well, that's good, right?

393
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:05,538
Everything's got to be better than cancer.

394
00:18:06,078 --> 00:18:07,339
Well, that's where it gets a little tricky.

395
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:16,511
The chromosomal tests have revealed that your body contains DNA from two different embryos that merged in the womb at the very beginning of development.

396
00:18:16,531 --> 00:18:20,857
In rare cases, such as yours, the condition can produce gonadal hermaphroditism.

397
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:24,162
I'm hearing scary words here, Preston.

398
00:18:24,182 --> 00:18:25,423
You know, pay cable kind of words.

399
00:18:25,864 --> 00:18:29,008
In English, the mass on your bladder is an ovary.

400
00:18:30,507 --> 00:18:31,868
Don't worry, we're going to remove it.

401
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,496
We have an excellent gynecological surgeon on staff.

402
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:38,898
You're telling me I'm a guy with an ovary?

403
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,061
It's simply a quirk of nature, man.

404
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:49,054
What am I going to tell Holly?

405
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:50,415
I bet you're going to be fine.

406
00:18:51,978 --> 00:18:52,919
I'm still a man, right?

407
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,462
A man's man, a Kappa man.

408
00:18:56,324 --> 00:18:56,785
I mean.

409
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,853
You know, my sex life.

410
00:18:59,693 --> 00:19:00,775
You been having any problems?

411
00:19:02,258 --> 00:19:07,184
Was it my very pregnant wife that gave it away?

412
00:19:07,204 --> 00:19:07,705
Come on, man.

413
00:19:07,726 --> 00:19:08,125
Don't worry.

414
00:19:09,327 --> 00:19:10,108
You never knew it was there.

415
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,111
You won't miss it when it's gone.

416
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:17,641
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

417
00:19:17,661 --> 00:19:18,962
It's a shot of penicillin, George.

418
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:20,285
Be grateful I'm even doing this.

419
00:19:20,305 --> 00:19:22,468
I've already seen more of you than I ever wanted to.

420
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:24,281
I'll be fighting nightmares for a week.

421
00:19:24,303 --> 00:19:24,843
OK, you know what?

422
00:19:24,883 --> 00:19:25,324
Forget this.

423
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:26,727
Do you want to get rid of the CIF or not?

424
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:32,175
Just shut up and drop them.

425
00:19:32,195 --> 00:19:34,058
I can't believe this.

426
00:19:34,078 --> 00:19:35,121
Meredith, go away!

427
00:19:36,082 --> 00:19:38,626
Oh, George, I thought you could use some moral support.

428
00:19:38,646 --> 00:19:40,329
No, no moral support.

429
00:19:40,911 --> 00:19:42,313
I'm indisposed here.

430
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:44,903
George, it's not a big deal.

431
00:19:44,963 --> 00:19:47,208
And you have a cute butt.

432
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,529
I have a cute butt, too.

433
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:49,330
You want to see?

434
00:19:49,351 --> 00:19:50,112
Oh, get out.

435
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:51,074
You're doing it wrong.

436
00:19:51,094 --> 00:19:52,075
Be my guest.

437
00:19:52,736 --> 00:19:53,336
What?

438
00:19:53,356 --> 00:19:53,678
Alex!

439
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:59,426
Alex!

440
00:19:59,446 --> 00:19:59,646
Hey!

441
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:01,349
What are we doing here?

442
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,693
Breaking George's spirit.

443
00:20:03,713 --> 00:20:05,195
Caring George's Sith.

444
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,039
I don't like needles.

445
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,682
Good thing you became a doctor.

446
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:09,603
Other side.

447
00:20:10,284 --> 00:20:10,565
Izzy?

448
00:20:10,805 --> 00:20:11,125
Yeah?

449
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:14,289
Uh, Mr. Franklin's procedure's been scheduled for after lunch.

450
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:15,351
What are we doing?

451
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:20,057
We are saving George from the future of festering sores and insanity.

452
00:20:20,597 --> 00:20:21,660
Oh, cute butt.

453
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,180
Told ya.

454
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:23,020
It is cute.

455
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,741
Like a baby's.

456
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:34,676
You know, I've spent hours, days, years imagining myself half naked in a room with three women.

457
00:20:35,752 --> 00:20:37,134
The reality is so much better.

458
00:20:38,496 --> 00:20:39,296
I think he's going to cry.

459
00:20:39,316 --> 00:20:43,941
Hi, it's Miss Henry again.

460
00:20:44,561 --> 00:20:45,382
Is this a better time?

461
00:20:45,823 --> 00:20:46,824
Sorry about this morning.

462
00:20:46,864 --> 00:20:47,644
I wasn't alone.

463
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:49,807
And what were you calling about?

464
00:20:49,826 --> 00:20:52,650
I just wanted to remind you that tonight's our monthly family dinner.

465
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,113
You know you haven't been to any of our family functions.

466
00:20:57,094 --> 00:21:00,857
You have to understand, I'm a surgical intern, so my time isn't my own.

467
00:21:01,538 --> 00:21:03,460
Our residents really respond to these events.

468
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:05,321
They always enjoy themselves.

469
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,471
which is so rare.

470
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,031
I think it's important you attend.

471
00:21:09,693 --> 00:21:10,253
I'll be there.

472
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:12,676
I'll try to be there.

473
00:21:13,297 --> 00:21:14,417
I'll definitely try.

474
00:21:14,438 --> 00:21:17,740
I've cleared some time for your MRI.

475
00:21:18,102 --> 00:21:18,342
Good.

476
00:21:18,382 --> 00:21:21,105
Let's get going.

477
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:21,184
OK.

478
00:21:21,204 --> 00:21:22,546
Sorry to bother you with this, Chief.

479
00:21:22,665 --> 00:21:25,087
We've got kind of a situation.

480
00:21:26,108 --> 00:21:26,589
What now?

481
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:34,396
Three interns, four residents, and six nurses on this surgical floor have been diagnosed with

482
00:21:35,288 --> 00:21:36,028
Syphilis.

483
00:21:36,648 --> 00:21:39,692
There are over 70,000 new cases every year.

484
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:45,337
Undiagnosed, syphilis can lead to blindness, insanity, and death.

485
00:21:45,699 --> 00:21:51,744
If you are having unprotected sex with another member of the staff, get tested.

486
00:21:52,285 --> 00:21:53,866
This is not a request.

487
00:21:59,071 --> 00:22:04,958
Patricia will now give you a safe sex demonstration.

488
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:16,083
When the time is right, and gentlemen, you'll all know when that time is, carefully open the condom packet and roll it onto the banana.

489
00:22:16,463 --> 00:22:18,526
I should try and get down to do the MRI now.

490
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,388
This isn't really a good time.

491
00:22:20,528 --> 00:22:23,152
Do you want to do this without anybody else knowing?

492
00:22:23,172 --> 00:22:23,833
You should do it now.

493
00:22:24,493 --> 00:22:28,417
Open communication is essential to a healthy relationship.

494
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:32,143
In a responsible relationship, poor George.

495
00:22:33,237 --> 00:22:35,661
You know, I think he really likes Tyford Mary.

496
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:39,808
Not many budding relationships survive a good dose of ED.

497
00:22:39,828 --> 00:22:43,394
Condom sense is common sense.

498
00:22:43,434 --> 00:22:44,115
Yeah.

499
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,057
Yeah.

500
00:22:45,618 --> 00:22:50,007
Gently peel off the condom and dispose of it properly.

501
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:55,296
With every fresh banana, always use a fresh condom.

502
00:22:56,136 --> 00:23:02,689
I'm just a walkin' my dog, singin' my song, strollin' along.

503
00:23:02,709 --> 00:23:06,576
It's just me and my dog, catchin' some sun.

504
00:23:06,836 --> 00:23:11,326
We can't go wrong.

505
00:23:11,346 --> 00:23:12,708
My life was only in blue.

506
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,895
Yeah, I was sad as a sailor.

507
00:23:22,174 --> 00:23:27,161
You're avoiding me.

508
00:23:27,882 --> 00:23:29,364
I'm busy.

509
00:23:29,564 --> 00:23:29,923
At work.

510
00:23:30,003 --> 00:23:30,644
I'm working.

511
00:23:31,306 --> 00:23:35,250
Why are you in this line?

512
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:37,432
It's a syphilis line.

513
00:23:37,453 --> 00:23:38,634
You don't need to be in this line.

514
00:23:38,775 --> 00:23:39,455
I don't?

515
00:23:40,897 --> 00:23:43,961
There's no one else.

516
00:23:44,261 --> 00:23:47,365
That surprises you?

517
00:23:48,145 --> 00:23:49,448
Nothing surprises me.

518
00:23:52,094 --> 00:23:55,538
Do I need to be in this line?

519
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,079
No.

520
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,227
OK, then.

521
00:24:00,247 --> 00:24:00,626
OK.

522
00:24:01,028 --> 00:24:01,769
Hey.

523
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,770
Oh, hey.

524
00:24:03,571 --> 00:24:04,653
Mr. Franklin is prepped and ready.

525
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:05,414
Excellent.

526
00:24:06,056 --> 00:24:07,038
God, look at this line.

527
00:24:07,057 --> 00:24:09,000
Well, at least we don't have to stand in line.

528
00:24:09,401 --> 00:24:13,647
That's the one good thing about the fact neither of us is getting any, right?

529
00:24:14,368 --> 00:24:19,958
Mr. Franklin, we've given you a local anesthetic, but you might feel some pressure.

530
00:24:23,701 --> 00:24:24,201
Okay.

531
00:24:25,984 --> 00:24:26,346
I'm ready.

532
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,016
Grab a scale, okay?

533
00:24:32,135 --> 00:24:35,182
Are you in the peritoneal cavity?

534
00:24:38,907 --> 00:24:40,791
The fluid is bloody.

535
00:24:40,991 --> 00:24:41,813
Is it supposed to be bloody?

536
00:24:41,853 --> 00:24:43,557
You've done this before, right?

537
00:24:43,856 --> 00:24:44,298
Of course.

538
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:45,480
Millions of times.

539
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:48,325
You're doing great, Mr. Franklin.

540
00:24:51,763 --> 00:24:52,565
Good.

541
00:24:52,644 --> 00:25:02,580
Now all we have to do is wait.

542
00:25:08,711 --> 00:25:09,652
You see that right there?

543
00:25:10,212 --> 00:25:10,394
Mm-hmm.

544
00:25:11,414 --> 00:25:11,976
It's a tumor.

545
00:25:12,917 --> 00:25:14,881
And it's pressing against your optic nerve.

546
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:15,682
Is it operable?

547
00:25:15,701 --> 00:25:16,303
Oh, definitely.

548
00:25:18,207 --> 00:25:19,989
You know, it does have its risks.

549
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:21,951
You mean I could lose my sight?

550
00:25:22,892 --> 00:25:23,031
Mm-hmm.

551
00:25:23,051 --> 00:25:23,752
So that's what I need.

552
00:25:24,153 --> 00:25:25,755
A syphilis outbreak and a tumor.

553
00:25:26,076 --> 00:25:27,096
Well, it's probably unrelated.

554
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,119
All right, Derek.

555
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,022
Let's see how good you really are.

556
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:34,525
All right.

557
00:25:34,545 --> 00:25:35,666
I'll put a team together.

558
00:25:35,686 --> 00:25:36,567
All my people only.

559
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:37,509
Mm-hmm.

560
00:25:37,528 --> 00:25:38,849
And I still want this kept under wraps.

561
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,791
The vultures will be circling soon enough.

562
00:25:41,012 --> 00:25:41,913
Aren't I one of the vultures?

563
00:25:42,314 --> 00:25:44,616
Why, do you think I want to keep an eye on you?

564
00:25:44,636 --> 00:25:45,076
Get going.

565
00:25:45,438 --> 00:25:46,318
We're doing this tonight.

566
00:25:46,858 --> 00:25:47,640
Right.

567
00:25:53,932 --> 00:25:54,432
You've aged.

568
00:25:54,893 --> 00:25:56,896
Yeah, I need you to help me out on something for the chief.

569
00:25:57,637 --> 00:25:58,378
Can you keep a secret?

570
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,301
Better than you think.

571
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:05,088
How much fluid can one body hold?

572
00:26:05,108 --> 00:26:05,589
Shh.

573
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,955
There's a lot of fluid in there, Mr. Franklin, but we're almost finished.

574
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:12,621
Mr. Franklin?

575
00:26:14,103 --> 00:26:14,542
You sleeping?

576
00:26:16,906 --> 00:26:17,468
Mr. Franklin?

577
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,310
He has no pulse.

578
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:19,651
What?

579
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:20,833
He has no pulse!

580
00:26:37,469 --> 00:26:39,952
How could he die just like that with no warning?

581
00:26:39,972 --> 00:26:41,715
There was blood in the tube when it first went in.

582
00:26:42,277 --> 00:26:42,939
What if it's our fault?

583
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:43,759
What if we did something wrong?

584
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:44,781
We didn't do anything wrong.

585
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:46,664
We did a textbook procedure.

586
00:26:48,989 --> 00:26:49,871
I checked your chart.

587
00:26:50,271 --> 00:26:51,313
You did everything by the book.

588
00:26:51,433 --> 00:26:52,174
He died on our watch.

589
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:53,237
We must have missed something.

590
00:26:53,557 --> 00:26:54,259
You couldn't have known.

591
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:56,041
There was no history of heart problems.

592
00:26:56,362 --> 00:26:57,463
His death wasn't your fault.

593
00:26:58,045 --> 00:26:58,726
When's the autopsy?

594
00:26:59,086 --> 00:27:00,169
There's going to be an autopsy.

595
00:27:00,976 --> 00:27:01,215
What?

596
00:27:01,717 --> 00:27:03,239
Well, how are we supposed to know the cause of death?

597
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:07,444
It's going down as cardiopulmonary arrest complicated by liver disease.

598
00:27:07,724 --> 00:27:12,490
But an autopsy will... The family decided they didn't want an autopsy.

599
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:14,815
But, Dr. Bailey... They don't want an autopsy.

600
00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:15,576
Let it go.

601
00:27:20,782 --> 00:27:22,044
Dr. Burke to cardiology.

602
00:27:22,064 --> 00:27:22,545
Dr. Burke to cardiology.

603
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,865
How goes our special super secret silent sunset surgery?

604
00:27:31,846 --> 00:27:33,288
I've been practicing that.

605
00:27:33,307 --> 00:27:34,648
You have too much time on your hands.

606
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,912
Uh, tell the chief I'll be there.

607
00:27:36,951 --> 00:27:38,814
Just let me know when and where I'm in.

608
00:27:40,935 --> 00:27:41,396
Okay.

609
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:44,519
Are you nervous?

610
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,922
It's a complicated surgery.

611
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:47,042
I'm gonna make one mistake.

612
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,324
I end a fellow surgeon's career.

613
00:27:48,964 --> 00:27:49,826
My mentor's career.

614
00:27:49,846 --> 00:27:50,086
Oh, no.

615
00:27:50,727 --> 00:27:51,346
I'm not nervous.

616
00:27:53,869 --> 00:27:55,372
So just for the record... Mm-hmm?

617
00:27:55,392 --> 00:27:57,273
You tell me if I need to get tested, right?

618
00:27:58,434 --> 00:27:59,596
I have syphilis.

619
00:27:59,615 --> 00:28:00,317
No, I don't.

620
00:28:00,557 --> 00:28:02,598
It's just we never made any rules or anything.

621
00:28:02,638 --> 00:28:06,222
I mean, we never said we have rules.

622
00:28:06,323 --> 00:28:08,285
And I wouldn't hold it against you.

623
00:28:08,464 --> 00:28:10,747
When would I have time to go out and get syphilis?

624
00:28:11,347 --> 00:28:12,489
You're handful enough as it is.

625
00:28:12,548 --> 00:28:14,951
And besides, we're practically a condom ad.

626
00:28:15,531 --> 00:28:17,153
But no more glow in the dark ones.

627
00:28:17,713 --> 00:28:19,175
You see, there's nothing to worry about.

628
00:28:19,215 --> 00:28:23,200
Maybe we should, you know, pick some walls, I mean.

629
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:23,559
We should.

630
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,501
OK.

631
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:25,741
OK.

632
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,853
I like the glow-in-the-dark ones.

633
00:28:32,873 --> 00:28:33,854
I bet you do.

634
00:28:42,102 --> 00:28:44,124
That's the last of the bilbarian material.

635
00:28:44,663 --> 00:28:47,287
I just need to sew up the perforation on the bladder wall.

636
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,310
Is there a problem, Dr. Knox?

637
00:28:52,892 --> 00:28:54,913
Well, you said this man's wife is pregnant?

638
00:28:55,474 --> 00:28:56,174
Due in five weeks.

639
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:56,394
Why?

640
00:28:56,915 --> 00:28:59,137
Our patient has a blind vest difference.

641
00:29:01,362 --> 00:29:01,982
Bill is sterile.

642
00:29:02,544 --> 00:29:03,404
And always has been.

643
00:29:05,407 --> 00:29:06,950
Then who got his wife pregnant?

644
00:29:10,996 --> 00:29:13,538
Oh.

645
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:14,140
Oh.

646
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,761
Sucks to be Bill right now.

647
00:29:16,063 --> 00:29:18,045
How's Burke going to tell him the baby's not his?

648
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,446
Burke's not going to tell him.

649
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:19,948
He has to.

650
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:20,528
They're friends.

651
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:21,871
Bill's better off not knowing.

652
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,732
Do you think Holly knows Bill's not the father?

653
00:29:23,752 --> 00:29:24,453
Maybe, maybe not.

654
00:29:24,535 --> 00:29:25,855
I think Bill should know his wife's cheating on him.

655
00:29:25,957 --> 00:29:26,998
I'd want to know.

656
00:29:27,586 --> 00:29:30,691
I don't remember asking for your opinions, so keep them to yourselves.

657
00:29:31,152 --> 00:29:32,973
Sorry, sir.

658
00:29:32,993 --> 00:29:33,915
You're such a gossip.

659
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:43,671
We know how confusing this must be, your husband dying so suddenly.

660
00:29:44,571 --> 00:29:46,275
But an autopsy will tell us why.

661
00:29:47,416 --> 00:29:49,941
So you think we should do the autopsy?

662
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,884
No, we just want this to be over.

663
00:29:52,183 --> 00:29:54,807
But don't you want to know for certain what killed him?

664
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,375
My father was a mean drunk who couldn't hold a job.

665
00:29:58,414 --> 00:30:00,198
That's what killed him.

666
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:05,827
I understand that you're angry, but knowing for sure might help give you some closure.

667
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:09,634
And it was awfully sudden, Alice.

668
00:30:09,653 --> 00:30:10,055
Sudden?

669
00:30:11,217 --> 00:30:12,900
He's been killing himself for years.

670
00:30:13,721 --> 00:30:14,722
He was a good man.

671
00:30:16,605 --> 00:30:17,708
Maybe they're right.

672
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:19,651
Maybe we should do the autopsy.

673
00:30:19,671 --> 00:30:21,775
Mom, stop it.

674
00:30:21,923 --> 00:30:22,605
He's dead.

675
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:24,869
It's finally over.

676
00:30:25,893 --> 00:30:28,598
Alice, your father would have wanted to.

677
00:30:28,699 --> 00:30:29,962
Who cares what he wanted?

678
00:30:29,982 --> 00:30:36,337
Can't we please just try and get out of this with whatever shred of dignity this family has left?

679
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:53,747
You guys want to perform an unauthorized autopsy.

680
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,270
I know you, Christina.

681
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,574
You do not want to be known as a new 007.

682
00:30:58,894 --> 00:31:00,116
An autopsy clears your name.

683
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,961
Christina, no.

684
00:31:03,602 --> 00:31:04,502
What about Franklin's wife?

685
00:31:05,023 --> 00:31:06,445
You saw the way she was looking at me.

686
00:31:06,486 --> 00:31:07,728
She wants the autopsy.

687
00:31:07,748 --> 00:31:09,009
She just didn't want to fight with her daughter.

688
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:10,332
She looks so sad.

689
00:31:10,372 --> 00:31:14,678
Okay, Christina Yang, license to kill.

690
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:19,373
Okay, I'm in.

691
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:21,717
I am so not involved in this.

692
00:31:21,957 --> 00:31:23,118
Meredith, this is Fight Club.

693
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:24,181
Nobody talks about it.

694
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:24,801
Fine.

695
00:31:26,002 --> 00:31:27,244
We have to do it when Bailey's not around.

696
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:28,186
Bailey's always around.

697
00:31:28,227 --> 00:31:29,469
She's everywhere and knows everything.

698
00:31:29,648 --> 00:31:30,770
Well, we have to take our chances.

699
00:31:31,412 --> 00:31:33,915
Bailey's got something tonight from 7 to 11.

700
00:31:33,955 --> 00:31:35,699
You two will be the last thing she's worried about.

701
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:36,539
How do you know that?

702
00:31:36,701 --> 00:31:37,382
What kind of something?

703
00:31:38,323 --> 00:31:39,505
Oh, I can't tell you that.

704
00:31:39,785 --> 00:31:40,767
It's Fight Club 2.

705
00:31:43,884 --> 00:31:54,842
If I'm missing out on a real patient because of this, they're going to call me 007 because I've killed you.

706
00:31:57,065 --> 00:31:57,526
How we doing?

707
00:31:57,967 --> 00:31:58,887
Did you lock up the gallery?

708
00:31:59,509 --> 00:31:59,848
Don't worry.

709
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:00,871
We're flying under the radar.

710
00:32:01,131 --> 00:32:02,413
What did you put out there?

711
00:32:02,432 --> 00:32:03,114
The Midas Rex?

712
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:04,836
We've got it, Chief.

713
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,078
How much vancomycin is there?

714
00:32:06,228 --> 00:32:07,810
One gram is ordered, sir.

715
00:32:07,951 --> 00:32:10,095
You're not going to be too liberal with those benzos, are you?

716
00:32:10,515 --> 00:32:12,357
You know, doctors make the worst patients.

717
00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:14,321
Why don't you just breathe in the happy gas?

718
00:32:14,662 --> 00:32:16,025
Stop running my OR.

719
00:32:18,268 --> 00:32:18,388
Ready?

720
00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:19,130
I got you covered.

721
00:32:28,726 --> 00:32:29,366
We stole a body.

722
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,251
We're body snatchers.

723
00:32:33,109 --> 00:32:34,932
What if somebody from the morgue comes looking for Franklin?

724
00:32:35,132 --> 00:32:40,238
Well, A, it's in the middle of the night, and B, the thing about being dead is people stop looking for you.

725
00:32:44,182 --> 00:32:44,242
OK.

726
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,564
When's the last time you did an autopsy?

727
00:32:45,944 --> 00:32:47,487
I took gross anatomy just like you.

728
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,407
I'm just trying to remember.

729
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:49,509
You know how to hold on.

730
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:49,868
Hold on.

731
00:32:49,929 --> 00:32:50,210
Wait.

732
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,211
Hold on.

733
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:53,834
You brought a textbook?

734
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:56,636
Uh, if we're going to do this, we're going to do it right.

735
00:33:05,054 --> 00:33:05,654
OK, got it.

736
00:33:06,174 --> 00:33:06,455
You sure?

737
00:33:06,496 --> 00:33:08,678
It's not like we can kill him twice.

738
00:33:13,824 --> 00:33:14,424
Let me cut.

739
00:33:14,605 --> 00:33:15,685
You'll get your turn.

740
00:33:19,369 --> 00:33:21,112
You should really be using the 10 blade.

741
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:22,354
Will you stop backseat cutting?

742
00:33:22,594 --> 00:33:23,994
We'll get the saw.

743
00:33:24,016 --> 00:33:27,118
OK, I've sutured the drain in place.

744
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,299
The staples look fine.

745
00:33:28,721 --> 00:33:29,422
All right, we're done here.

746
00:33:29,461 --> 00:33:30,542
Dr. Billy, you want to wrap him?

747
00:33:31,304 --> 00:33:32,265
Nice work, everybody.

748
00:33:32,325 --> 00:33:32,986
Nicely done.

749
00:33:33,066 --> 00:33:34,166
Thanks.

750
00:33:37,656 --> 00:33:39,941
Hiya.

751
00:33:39,961 --> 00:33:41,723
Do you think the optic nerve is damaged?

752
00:33:42,806 --> 00:33:46,311
If it is, when he wakes up, he'll be blind.

753
00:33:47,794 --> 00:33:48,375
For how long?

754
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:49,676
Forever.

755
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:54,285
Paige, Stevens, and Yang, tell them I want them covering your patients.

756
00:33:54,925 --> 00:33:58,332
I need you to stay and monitor the chief.

757
00:34:00,218 --> 00:34:04,083
Christina and Izzy, I think they're already swamped.

758
00:34:04,763 --> 00:34:05,183
With what?

759
00:34:05,684 --> 00:34:06,065
Labs.

760
00:34:06,726 --> 00:34:08,228
They had to check on some labs.

761
00:34:10,891 --> 00:34:12,632
Oh, you are lying.

762
00:34:14,474 --> 00:34:15,476
I know you're lying.

763
00:34:15,516 --> 00:34:16,398
You know how I know?

764
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:17,679
Because you're a bad liar.

765
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,802
I hate a bad liar.

766
00:34:25,248 --> 00:34:25,849
Take over for me.

767
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:28,452
I know exactly where they are.

768
00:34:28,693 --> 00:34:29,853
Here, take over for me.

769
00:34:37,782 --> 00:34:39,463
Your whole relationship is a lie.

770
00:34:41,065 --> 00:34:41,686
We're happy.

771
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:43,929
We've wanted a child for a long time.

772
00:34:44,268 --> 00:34:45,791
Why do you want to take this away from him?

773
00:34:45,811 --> 00:34:46,913
Does he know you've been cheating on him?

774
00:34:46,932 --> 00:34:49,315
Preston, this is between Bill and me.

775
00:34:49,496 --> 00:34:51,458
The man has a right to know that this isn't his child.

776
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:54,762
Please, just let this go.

777
00:34:55,081 --> 00:34:56,182
Why can't you let this go?

778
00:34:56,403 --> 00:34:57,625
Because Bill is my best friend.

779
00:34:57,644 --> 00:34:58,105
That's why.

780
00:34:58,166 --> 00:34:59,246
You were really his friend.

781
00:34:59,606 --> 00:35:00,447
You wouldn't do this.

782
00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:01,769
Molly, please, tell him the truth.

783
00:35:01,929 --> 00:35:02,230
Why?

784
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,673
I'm not going to ruin my life because you think this is wrong.

785
00:35:05,713 --> 00:35:06,355
Your life?

786
00:35:07,059 --> 00:35:07,860
What about his life?

787
00:35:08,161 --> 00:35:09,282
What about this child's life?

788
00:35:10,443 --> 00:35:11,865
What Bill doesn't know won't hurt him.

789
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:15,650
Fine.

790
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,135
Maybe his friend wouldn't tell him the truth.

791
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:31,070
But I'm also his doctor, and his doctor is not going to lie to him.

792
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:34,355
I know, but something came up, an important surgery, and I couldn't.

793
00:35:35,076 --> 00:35:36,898
I'm just sorry you couldn't be there for your mother.

794
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:40,405
Miss Henry, if my mother were lucid, she would understand.

795
00:35:40,507 --> 00:35:41,268
She's a surgeon.

796
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:43,351
She's done this countless times.

797
00:35:44,092 --> 00:35:46,655
And besides, she doesn't even know who I am anyway, so.

798
00:35:46,675 --> 00:35:48,157
Today she did.

799
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:49,860
What?

800
00:35:50,802 --> 00:35:53,646
Your mother's been asking when her daughter Meredith gets off from work.

801
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:00,076
Hey.

802
00:36:00,096 --> 00:36:01,538
Hey.

803
00:36:01,557 --> 00:36:02,920
A lot of secret phone calls today.

804
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:10,547
Yeah, it's my mother.

805
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:16,715
She isn't traveling.

806
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:19,478
She isn't writing a book.

807
00:36:21,382 --> 00:36:22,143
She isn't anything.

808
00:36:22,202 --> 00:36:24,125
I've been lying to everyone.

809
00:36:25,887 --> 00:36:26,168
Why?

810
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:29,371
She has Alzheimer's.

811
00:36:31,574 --> 00:36:32,175
How advanced?

812
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:32,675
Very.

813
00:36:33,556 --> 00:36:34,217
She's in a home.

814
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:36,501
And I'm the only one who even knows she's sick.

815
00:36:38,016 --> 00:37:01,170
I just don't know what to do anymore, you know?

816
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:05,356
Don't even tell me you're doing what I think you're doing.

817
00:37:10,264 --> 00:37:21,237
Not only did you disregard the family's wishes, you broke the law.

818
00:37:21,257 --> 00:37:23,159
You could be arrested for assault.

819
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:24,581
Do you like jail?

820
00:37:25,141 --> 00:37:26,623
The hospital could be sued.

821
00:37:26,664 --> 00:37:28,925
I could lose my license, my job.

822
00:37:29,045 --> 00:37:30,728
I like my job.

823
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,833
Did you think about any of this before you started cutting open a poor man's body?

824
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:37,295
I could seriously kick both your asses right now.

825
00:37:37,416 --> 00:37:39,157
Do you have anything to say?

826
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:42,056
Look at his heart.

827
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:43,998
It's huge.

828
00:37:44,298 --> 00:37:45,581
It's over 600 grams.

829
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:47,822
And there's some kind of grainy material in it.

830
00:37:48,063 --> 00:37:49,385
We want to run some tests.

831
00:37:49,405 --> 00:37:51,447
Oh, now you want to run tests.

832
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:52,668
At this point, what could it hurt?

833
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:57,333
I hate both of you right now.

834
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:09,146
Lab 2743, extension 2743.

835
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:09,567
Meredith.

836
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:11,938
He's an attendee.

837
00:38:12,641 --> 00:38:13,581
You're an intern.

838
00:38:14,322 --> 00:38:14,903
You saw us?

839
00:38:16,405 --> 00:38:17,188
You can see.

840
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:22,155
I'm going to tell you what your mother would say if she were here.

841
00:38:24,418 --> 00:38:26,742
You're making a mistake, a big one.

842
00:38:29,487 --> 00:38:31,469
And I would tell my mother it's not a mistake.

843
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:38,577
We specifically said no autopsy.

844
00:38:38,597 --> 00:38:41,422
I understand why you're upset.

845
00:38:41,601 --> 00:38:42,322
You understand.

846
00:38:43,744 --> 00:38:44,646
We're going to get an attorney.

847
00:38:45,246 --> 00:38:46,228
Come on, Mom.

848
00:38:46,248 --> 00:38:47,090
We know what killed him.

849
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:50,655
He had a blood condition known as hematomacrosis.

850
00:38:51,335 --> 00:38:58,387
The disease causes an excess amount of iron to build up in the body, and that's what caused the heart failure, not the paracentesis.

851
00:38:58,766 --> 00:39:02,012
But I thought he was always so sick because of the drinking.

852
00:39:02,693 --> 00:39:03,954
And you never let him forget it.

853
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:05,059
Or me.

854
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:06,942
Mom, there's something else.

855
00:39:07,402 --> 00:39:08,463
The disease is genetic.

856
00:39:08,864 --> 00:39:10,266
You think Alice could have it too?

857
00:39:10,427 --> 00:39:11,728
A simple blood test will tell us.

858
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:16,295
If you have it, we'll have caught it early enough to treat it before the condition becomes critical.

859
00:39:16,795 --> 00:39:19,920
Dr. Stevens and Dr. Yang may have saved your life.

860
00:39:26,268 --> 00:39:30,994
If you could just sign this consent form for the autopsy.

861
00:39:31,835 --> 00:39:33,097
Just a formality.

862
00:39:38,596 --> 00:39:43,820
forget is how good it can feel when you finally set secrets free.

863
00:39:47,244 --> 00:39:53,972
Whether good or bad, at least they're out in the open, like it or not.

864
00:40:00,018 --> 00:40:02,159
But I'll find a way.

865
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:02,780
I'll find another way.

866
00:40:08,751 --> 00:40:09,672
About before.

867
00:40:09,873 --> 00:40:12,717
George, I want you to understand.

868
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:17,143
When we started dating, I was already kind of seeing someone.

869
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,208
I didn't know how much I'd like you.

870
00:40:20,909 --> 00:40:23,231
And when I realized, I broke it off with the other guy.

871
00:40:23,251 --> 00:40:23,952
The other guy?

872
00:40:26,556 --> 00:40:27,217
Who's the other guy?

873
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:33,585
You and Alex.

874
00:40:36,951 --> 00:40:38,353
You and Alex?

875
00:40:38,755 --> 00:40:43,820
You gave me syphilis!

876
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:43,980
George!

877
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,001
George!

878
00:40:45,862 --> 00:40:46,001
George!

879
00:40:46,021 --> 00:40:46,362
George, back off!

880
00:40:46,382 --> 00:40:46,722
George, back off!

881
00:40:46,742 --> 00:40:46,842
Alex!

882
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:47,003
George!

883
00:40:47,023 --> 00:40:47,483
Back off, Alex.

884
00:40:51,027 --> 00:40:59,635
And once your secrets are out in the open, you don't have to hide behind them anymore.

885
00:40:59,655 --> 00:41:00,237
Long day.

886
00:41:00,757 --> 00:41:02,259
Yeah.

887
00:41:02,278 --> 00:41:04,260
Somewhere out there is a stake with your name on it.

888
00:41:04,701 --> 00:41:06,802
And maybe a bottle of wine.

889
00:41:06,822 --> 00:41:08,744
This is why I keep you around.

890
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:13,757
first, talk later.

891
00:41:13,777 --> 00:41:17,242
You trying to, uh, get me drunk so you can take advantage of me?

892
00:41:18,204 --> 00:41:19,806
I think I like this rules thing.

893
00:41:21,389 --> 00:41:21,708
Me too.

894
00:41:36,731 --> 00:41:37,791
Meredith, I'm so sorry.

895
00:41:38,452 --> 00:41:40,655
The problem with secrets is...

896
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:42,907
Even when you think you're in control?

897
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:44,750
Addison.

898
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,150
You're not.

899
00:41:46,811 --> 00:41:48,634
What are you doing here?

900
00:41:48,653 --> 00:41:51,418
Well, you'd know if you bothered to return any one of my phone calls.

901
00:41:51,438 --> 00:41:51,498
Hi.

902
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,641
I'm Addison Shepherd.

903
00:41:57,706 --> 00:41:58,065
Shepherd?

904
00:41:59,467 --> 00:42:01,851
And you must be the woman who's been screwing my husband.

905
00:42:07,432 --> 00:42:11,519
Whatever gets you to today.
