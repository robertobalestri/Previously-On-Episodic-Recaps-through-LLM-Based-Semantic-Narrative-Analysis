Meredith Grey began her day reflecting on the relentless competition among surgical residents, observing that she, Izzie Stevens, George O'Malley, and Cristina Yang spent more time together than apart. At Meredith's house, Izzie complained that George's room was larger than hers and argued she deserved the bigger space for her expanding wardrobe. George insisted he had arrived first and deferred the decision to Meredith, since it was her house. Cristina interjected, declaring that everything in their world was a competition, and that residents constantly kept score and tried to outmaneuver one another.

Izzie suggested they make the house feel more like a home by unpacking boxes belonging to Meredith's mother, including a collection of tapes showing her performing medical procedures. Cristina was intrigued by the idea of watching the tapes, but Meredith hesitated, uncertain about revisiting her mother's legacy. The group discussed the possibility of Meredith's mother returning and the significance of her belongings in the house.

At the hospital, Meredith greeted Dr. Miranda Bailey, who brusquely reminded her of the strict hierarchy among staff. George felt uneasy, sensing he was forgetting something important about the day. The residents and interns soon learned about the annual “Dead Baby Bike Race,” an illegal and dangerous event where bike messengers raced through city traffic for prizes. Alex Karev explained the race's lack of rules, except for “no eye gouging,” and Cristina expressed excitement about the competitive nature, while Izzie questioned the sanity of the participants.

Dr. Bailey assigned George to assist the chief, Dr. Richard Webber, but Webber instead instructed George to monitor his pre- and post-operative patients. George was tasked with caring for Lloyd Mackey, a VIP patient suffering from liver cancer. Mackey joked about his situation and flirted with George, while Izzie encouraged him, noting that he was at the top of the donor list. Mackey, however, remained cynical about his chances of survival.

The emergency room was soon overwhelmed with trauma cases from the bike race. Cristina and other residents treated a John Doe pedestrian who had been struck by a car avoiding a cyclist. The patient was declared brain dead, and Dr. Derek Shepherd ordered confirmatory tests. The team discussed the technicalities of brain death and organ donation, with Izzie clinging to hope for a miracle and struggling emotionally with the process.

Izzie and Cristina searched through the John Doe's belongings, finding clues that suggested he had a family. They worked to identify him and contacted the police, hoping to obtain consent for organ donation. Cristina and Izzie debated the ethics of harvesting organs from a John Doe, and Izzie pleaded with the patient to survive.

As time ran out, Izzie and Cristina decided to administer dopamine and blood transfusions to keep the patient viable for organ donation, despite the ethical ambiguity. Cristina discovered that the patient had a traumatic aortic injury and required surgery to remain a viable donor. The interns strategized how to persuade Dr. Burke to perform the surgery, ultimately going over his head to Dr. Webber by highlighting the match between the John Doe and Mackey's liver needs.

Dr. Burke was initially resistant but eventually agreed to perform the surgery. The police identified the John Doe as Kevin Davidson, and his wife, Mrs. Davidson, arrived at the hospital. The team discussed organ donation with Mrs. Davidson, explaining the process and its potential to help burn victims and others in need. Alex struggled with communicating with families and was reminded by Dr. Bailey that patients were people, not just collections of organs.

Lloyd Mackey expressed gratitude to George for finding him a liver, and the two shared a heartfelt conversation about attraction and boldness in the face of death. George admitted his feelings for Meredith, and Mackey encouraged him to be courageous.

The organ harvest proceeded, and Cristina carefully sewed up Kevin Davidson for his family. Mrs. Davidson was brought in to see her husband, and the team offered comfort. Meanwhile, Viper, a recurring patient from the bike race, returned to the emergency room, and Alex and Cristina managed his case.

Throughout the day, the residents faced personal and professional challenges, wrestling with competition, ethical dilemmas, and emotional struggles. Meredith reflected on the nature of competition and survival, concluding that true victories were measured by lives saved. The episode ended with the group gathered together, watching Meredith's mother's surgical tapes, sharing a moment of camaraderie and learning.
