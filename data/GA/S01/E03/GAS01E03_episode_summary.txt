Dr. Meredith Grey began the day reflecting on the competitive world of surgical residents, who spent nearly all their time together on the hospital's surgical unit. At Meredith's house, Izzie Stevens and George O'Malley argued over who deserved the bigger bedroom, with Izzie insisting her extensive wardrobe required more space and George countering that he had arrived first. Their bickering shifted to the clutter left by Meredith's mother, prompting Izzie to suggest they unpack and make the house feel like home. While sorting through boxes, Izzie found tapes of Meredith's mother performing surgeries and proposed watching them, but Meredith hesitated, uncomfortable with the idea.

At the hospital, Dr. Miranda Bailey reminded the interns of the strict hierarchy, warning them not to fight over patients or associate with ER interns. The day coincided with the annual “Dead Baby Bike Race,” an illegal event notorious for causing a surge of traumatic injuries. The interns—Cristina Yang, Alex Karev, Izzie, George, and Meredith—discussed the absurdity of the race and the reckless participants, while Cristina and Alex vied for the most interesting trauma cases.

A major trauma soon arrived: a John Doe pedestrian who had been struck by a car avoiding the bike race. Dr. Derek Shepherd assessed the patient and determined he was likely brain dead, ordering tests to confirm. Izzie struggled with the prospect of declaring the patient dead, holding out hope for a miracle, while George explained the importance of following protocol to ensure the patient was truly gone before calling time of death.

Meanwhile, George was assigned by Dr. Burke to monitor his friend Lloyd Mackey, a liver cancer patient at the top of the transplant list. Mackey, cynical about his chances, joked with George, who tried to encourage him despite the grim prognosis.

The interns noticed clues about the John Doe: new sneakers, a sewn shirt, and a hotel key card, suggesting he had a family. They contacted the police, hoping to identify him before the six-hour window for brain death confirmation closed. Izzie, Meredith, and Cristina debated the ethics of keeping him alive for organ donation. Izzie insisted on respecting his right to every minute of life, while Cristina focused on the value his organs could bring to other patients.

Izzie tried to connect with the John Doe, speaking to him and urging him to fight for life. When he began to crash before the six-hour mark, Cristina led the interns in intervening with dopamine and a blood transfusion to keep him viable as a potential organ donor. They discovered he had a traumatic aortic injury that required surgery to preserve his organs. The interns appealed to Dr. Burke to operate, but he refused, so they approached Chief Webber, using Mackey's urgent need for a liver as leverage.

Chief Webber authorized the surgery, and Dr. Burke performed the aortic repair with the interns assisting. The police soon identified the John Doe as Kevin Davidson, and his wife arrived at the hospital. Izzie gently explained the situation to Mrs. Davidson and discussed the possibility of organ donation. The organ procurement coordinator guided Mrs. Davidson through the consent process, including the donation of corneas and skin, which was emotionally taxing for the family.

Cristina admitted her discomfort with dealing with grieving families and struggled with the emotional side of medicine. Meredith reminded Cristina to see Kevin as a person, not just a source of organs. As the team prepared for the organ harvest, Kevin's friends and family gathered to say their goodbyes.

During this time, George and Mackey shared a moment of camaraderie. Mackey joked about taking George out after his transplant and explained that his boldness came from having nothing left to lose. He also asked George about his unspoken feelings for Meredith.

Elsewhere, the interns treated Viper, a frequent bike race patient, and rushed him to surgery. Alex Karev tried to impress Dr. Bailey but was reprimanded for showing off. Meredith, frustrated with Alex's attitude, told him to stay out of her way.

Later, Meredith confided in Cristina about the chaos at home caused by her roommates. Cristina suggested kicking them out, but Meredith admitted she had invited them to move in. They joked about repressing their feelings and the challenges of living together.

The day ended with the organ harvest for Kevin Davidson, as his loved ones grieved. Dr. Bailey lectured the bike racers about the consequences of their reckless actions. Viper survived his surgery, and his friends expressed their gratitude to the doctors.

In the final moments, Derek Shepherd told Meredith that his interest in her was genuine and not just about the thrill of pursuit, but Meredith stood firm in her refusal to date him. Chief Webber reported that Mackey's surgery had gone smoothly, and Mackey joked about needing to quit smoking.

Meredith reflected that true victories in medicine were measured by lives saved, not by competition. That evening, the interns gathered at Meredith's house and watched one of her mother's surgical tapes together, sharing a rare moment of camaraderie and relief after a challenging day.
