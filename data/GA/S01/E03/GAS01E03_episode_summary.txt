A surgical resident reflected on the demanding life of an intern, describing the long hours and the close quarters shared with fellow residents. In Meredith's house, George and Izzie argued over who deserved the bigger bedroom, each citing reasons like closet space and who arrived first. They asked Meredith about her mother's belongings, wondering if they could unpack or store them. Izzie mentioned finding tapes of Meredith's mother performing surgeries and suggested they watch them together. When asked if she wanted privacy, Meredith seemed uncertain.

At the hospital, a character greeted Dr. Bailey, who brusquely told them to be quiet. Dr. Bailey was reminded by another resident that she was now an attending, not a resident, but she seemed distracted, trying to remember something important she was forgetting.

In the emergency room, staff prepared for the aftermath of the annual, illegal, and dangerous ‘dead baby bike race' involving bike messengers. The staff discussed the nature of the race and the injuries it caused. Dr. Bailey gave the interns strict instructions about trauma care, warning them not to fight over patients and to avoid mingling with ER interns. She emphasized the need to discharge patients quickly.

Soon, the trauma bay filled with injured bike racers. Two interns argued over who would treat a particular patient, flipping a coin to decide. The patient, eager to return to the race, asked for his injuries to be treated quickly. Meanwhile, another trauma patient, an unidentified man hit by a car, was brought in with severe injuries and a poor prognosis. Dr. Shepherd instructed the team to perform tests to confirm brain death if there was no response in six hours.

Dr. Bailey sent George to assist an attending, but he was told to stay on the floor and monitor pre- and post-op patients instead of scrubbing in. The attending asked George to look after his friend, Lloyd Mackey, and to give him whatever he needed.

George found Mackey smoking in his hospital room. George told him that smoking was not allowed and tried to convince him to stop, mentioning that Mackey was at the top of the liver donor list. Mackey was cynical about his chances, having waited eight months, and joked with George about baseball and his long friendship with the chief of surgery.

A group of interns monitored the unidentified trauma patient. They discussed the process of declaring brain death and the lack of hope for recovery. Izzie held out hope for a miracle, but another intern explained the medical reality. They noted personal details about the patient, such as new sneakers and a sewn shirt, and discussed the potential for organ donation if his family could be found.

One intern flirted with a bike race patient while treating his injuries. The patient refused further tests and insisted on leaving to finish the race. The intern warned him about leaving against medical advice and had him sign a form. The patient kissed the intern for luck before leaving.

Two characters discussed their past romantic encounters, including having sex and kissing in an elevator. One asked the other out, but was refused. The conversation turned to the idea of ‘the chase' and whether pursuing a relationship was just a game. The woman insisted she had something to prove and that it was not a game for her.

The interns approached Dr. Burke in the OR to ask about performing a harvest surgery on the brain-dead John Doe. Burke was skeptical, explaining that without family consent, organ donation was unlikely. The interns resolved to try to find the patient's family.

George confided in another intern that Mackey, the VIP patient, was interested in him. The other intern joked about George's sexuality, and George clarified he was not gay. Another intern brought news that the John Doe's key card was from a hotel, and the police had been called to help identify him. The group discussed the urgency of finding the family for organ donation consent.

An intern spoke to the unconscious John Doe, encouraging him to recover for the sake of his family and asking him to try to live.

Before the six-hour mark, the John Doe began to crash. Izzie insisted he deserved the full time before being declared dead. Another intern agreed to help, and they began transfusing blood and administering dopamine to keep him alive until the deadline.

George examined Mackey, who flirted with him and complimented his eyes. George was flustered by the attention, but Mackey continued to joke and enjoy the interaction.

The John Doe was stabilized for the moment. The interns learned from a radiologist that he had a traumatic aortic injury and would need surgery to remain a viable organ donor. The group decided to try to get him into surgery and to continue searching for his family. They discussed which attending to approach for the surgery and decided to go over Dr. Bailey's head.

The interns approached Dr. Burke in the men's room to ask him to perform the aortic repair on the brain-dead John Doe. Burke was annoyed that they had given the patient a transfusion without consulting anyone and refused to operate, stating that the patient was already dead.

One intern sought advice from another about how to get around Dr. Burke's refusal. The advice was to get the chief of surgery involved. The interns discussed the potential for a liver transplant for Mackey if the John Doe was a match. George was told to ask the chief directly.

George approached the chief of surgery and, after some hesitation, told him that a liver had been found for Mackey. The interns were nervous about going over Burke's head but proceeded with their plan.

Dr. Burke performed the aortic repair on the John Doe. Another intern praised Burke's surgical skill, while others expressed frustration that they did not get to participate in the surgery. The police called to inform the interns that the John Doe had been identified and his wife was on the way.

The John Doe's wife arrived at the hospital and was devastated to see her husband, Kevin. Dr. Stevens introduced herself and offered support. The wife asked if there was still hope, and was told they could wait until morning before discussing organ donation if there was no change.

The chief visited Mackey, who joked about George not letting him smoke. The chief told Mackey that George might have found him a liver.

A group of interns celebrated after surgery, joking about the smell of open-heart surgery. Meredith confronted another intern about his behavior, telling him to stay out of her way and criticizing him for taking credit for others' work. The intern complained to others that Meredith had attacked him.

Cristina and Meredith discussed the challenges of living with roommates. Cristina suggested Meredith could kick them out, but Meredith said she couldn't because she had invited them. They joked about repressing feelings and the difficulties of sharing space. Cristina complained about being assigned to the pit again while others got to participate in an organ harvest.

Dr. Stevens discussed organ donation with Mrs. Davidson, asking for consent to donate Kevin's corneas and skin. Mrs. Davidson was distressed by the idea of her husband being disfigured for the funeral and hesitated to consent to skin donation.

Cristina admitted to another intern that she was not good at talking to patients' families. She was reminded to refer to the patient by name, Kevin Davidson, rather than as John Doe or by his condition. The importance of remembering the patient's humanity was emphasized.

Mackey thanked George for finding him a liver and joked about taking George out to celebrate. George clarified that he was not interested in men, and Mackey said he never thought George was gay. Mackey explained that being terminally ill allowed him to be bold and flirtatious. He asked George if he had ever been attracted to someone he couldn't have, and George reluctantly admitted he liked Meredith.

Dr. Burke and another surgeon prepared for the organ harvest. Burke expressed his dislike for harvesting, saying he preferred to save lives. The harvest proceeded.

Izzie was told she could sew up Kevin for his family. Another character encouraged her to do it herself. Izzie prepared the body for the family to see.

Mrs. Davidson was told that her husband was ready if she would like to see him. She was brought in to say goodbye.

A group of friends of the bike racer known as Viper arrived at the hospital to check on him. Dr. Bailey scolded them for their reckless behavior, blaming the race for causing harm to others. Another intern reassured the group that Viper would survive.

A male character told a female character that his interest in her was not about the thrill of the chase or a game. He mentioned her hair and bossiness as things he liked. She insisted she still would not go out with him.

The liver transplant for Mackey went smoothly. Mackey joked that he would have to quit smoking now.

Reflecting on the lessons of residency, a character concluded that success was measured by lives saved, not competition. The interns gathered at Meredith's house and watched one of Ellis Grey's surgical tapes together, sharing a moment of camaraderie.
