The episode opens with Meredith Grey reflecting on the intense, competitive nature of life as a surgical resident, noting that the residents spend more time together than apart. Izzie Stevens complains that George O'Malley's room is bigger than hers and argues she should have the larger room due to her growing wardrobe, but George insists he got there first and that Meredith should decide since it's her house. Cristina Yang chimes in, emphasizing that everything is a competition and that residents always keep score and try to outsmart each other.

Izzie suggests making the house more homey by unpacking Meredith’s mother’s boxes and adding decorations, mentioning a box of tapes showing Meredith’s mother performing medical procedures. Cristina is intrigued and proposes watching them, but Meredith is hesitant. The group discusses the presence of Meredith’s mother’s things and the possibility of her return.

At the hospital, Meredith greets Dr. Miranda Bailey, who brusquely reminds her of the hierarchy. George feels he’s forgetting something important about the day. The residents and interns learn about the annual “Dead Baby Bike Race,” an illegal, dangerous event where bike messengers race through traffic for prizes. Alex Karev explains the race’s lack of rules except for “no eye gouging,” and Cristina expresses excitement about the competitive aspect, while Izzie questions the sanity of the participants.

Dr. Bailey assigns George to assist the chief, Dr. Richard Webber, but Webber instructs George to monitor his pre- and post-op patients instead. George is tasked with looking after Lloyd Mackey, a VIP patient with liver cancer, who jokes about his situation and flirts with George. Izzie encourages Mackey, noting he’s at the top of the donor list, but Mackey is cynical about his chances.

Meanwhile, the ER is flooded with trauma cases from the bike race. Cristina and other residents treat a John Doe pedestrian hit by a car avoiding a cyclist. The patient is brain dead, and Dr. Derek Shepherd orders confirmatory tests. The team discusses the technicalities of brain death and organ donation, with Izzie holding out hope for a miracle and struggling emotionally with the process.

Izzie and Cristina investigate the John Doe’s belongings, finding clues that he has a family. They work to identify him and contact the police, hoping to get consent for organ donation. Cristina and Izzie debate the ethics of harvesting organs from a John Doe, and Izzie pleads with the patient to live.

As the clock ticks down, Izzie and Cristina decide to give the patient dopamine and blood transfusions to keep him viable for organ donation, despite the ethical gray area. Cristina discovers the patient has a traumatic aortic injury and needs surgery to remain a viable donor. The interns strategize how to get Dr. Burke to perform the surgery, eventually going over his head to Dr. Webber by leveraging the match between John Doe and Mackey’s liver needs.

Dr. Burke is initially resistant but eventually performs the surgery. The police identify the John Doe as Kevin Davidson, and his wife, Mrs. Davidson, arrives at the hospital. The team discusses organ donation with her, explaining the process and the impact on burn victims and others. Alex struggles with talking to families and is reminded by Bailey that patients are people, not just collections of organs.

Mackey is grateful to George for finding him a liver, and the two share a heartfelt conversation about attraction and boldness in the face of death. George admits his feelings for Meredith, and Mackey encourages him to be bold.

The organ harvest proceeds, and Cristina sews up Kevin Davidson for his family. Mrs. Davidson is brought in to see her husband, and the team comforts her. Meanwhile, Viper, a recurring patient from the bike race, returns to the ER, and Alex and Cristina handle his case.

Throughout the episode, the residents grapple with personal and professional challenges, including competition, ethical dilemmas, and emotional struggles. Meredith reflects on the nature of competition and survival, concluding that victories are measured by lives saved, not by winning or losing. The episode ends with the group watching Meredith’s mother’s surgical tapes together, sharing a moment of camaraderie and learning.

In summary, the episode centers on the aftermath of the Dead Baby Bike Race, the ethical and emotional complexities of organ donation from a brain-dead John Doe, the residents’ competitive dynamics, and their efforts to save lives both in and out of the operating room. The interns navigate personal relationships, professional boundaries, and the realities of life and death in the hospital, ultimately finding meaning in teamwork and compassion.
