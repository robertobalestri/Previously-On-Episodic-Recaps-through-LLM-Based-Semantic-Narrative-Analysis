The episode opens with Dr. Meredith Grey narrating about the intense, competitive lives of surgical residents, who spend most of their time together on the surgical unit. At Meredith’s house, Izzie Stevens and George O’Malley bicker about who should get the bigger room, with Izzie arguing she has more clothes and George countering that he arrived first. The conversation shifts to Meredith’s mother’s belongings cluttering the house, and Izzie suggests unpacking and making the place feel more like home. Izzie discovers a box of tapes showing Meredith’s mother performing surgeries and proposes watching them, but Meredith is hesitant.

At the hospital, Dr. Miranda Bailey reminds the interns of the hierarchy and warns them not to fight over patients or mingle with ER interns. The day is marked by the annual “Dead Baby Bike Race,” an illegal and dangerous underground bike race that results in numerous injuries. The interns discuss the absurdity of the event and the types of people who participate, with Cristina Yang and Alex Karev competing for interesting trauma cases.

A major trauma arrives: a John Doe pedestrian, later identified as Kevin Davidson, who was hit by a car avoiding the bike race. Dr. Derek Shepherd determines that the patient is likely brain dead and orders confirmatory tests. Izzie struggles emotionally with the idea of declaring the patient dead, hoping for a miracle, while George explains the necessity of following protocol to ensure the patient is truly gone before calling time of death.

Meanwhile, George is assigned by Dr. Burke to monitor his friend Lloyd Mackey, a liver cancer patient at the top of the transplant list. Mackey is cynical about his prognosis and jokes with George, who tries to encourage him.

The interns notice that the John Doe has new sneakers, a sewn shirt, and a hotel key card, suggesting he has a family. They contact the police to help identify him, hoping to find his relatives before the six-hour window for brain death confirmation closes. Izzie, Meredith, and Cristina debate the ethics of keeping him alive for organ donation, with Izzie advocating for his right to every minute and Cristina focusing on the value of his organs.

Izzie tries to connect with the John Doe, talking to him and urging him to live. When he begins to crash before the six-hour mark, the interns, led by Cristina, decide to intervene with dopamine and a blood transfusion to keep him viable as a potential organ donor. They discover he has a traumatic aortic injury and needs surgery to remain a viable donor. The interns attempt to persuade Dr. Burke to operate, but he refuses, so they go over his head to Chief Webber, using Mackey’s need for a liver as leverage.

Chief Webber approves the surgery, and Dr. Burke performs the aortic repair, with the interns assisting. The police identify the John Doe as Kevin Davidson, and his wife arrives at the hospital. Izzie gently explains the situation and discusses organ donation with her. The organ procurement coordinator walks Mrs. Davidson through the consent process, including the donation of corneas and skin, which is emotionally difficult for the family.

Cristina admits she is not good at dealing with families and struggles with the human side of medicine. Meredith reminds her to see Kevin as a person, not just a source of organs. The team prepares for the organ harvest, and Kevin’s friends and family say their goodbyes.

Meanwhile, George and Mackey share a moment of camaraderie, with Mackey joking about taking George out after his transplant. Mackey explains his boldness as a dying man’s privilege and asks George about his own unrequited feelings for Meredith.

Elsewhere, the interns treat Viper, a recurring bike race patient, and rush him to surgery. Alex Karev tries to impress Dr. Bailey but is chastised for showing off. Meredith, frustrated with Alex’s attitude, tells him to stay out of her way.

Later, Meredith vents to Cristina about her roommates and the chaos at home. Cristina suggests kicking them out, but Meredith admits she invited them to move in. They joke about repressing their feelings and the challenges of living together.

The episode concludes with the organ harvest for Kevin Davidson, as his friends and family grieve. Dr. Bailey lectures the bike racers about the consequences of their reckless behavior. Viper survives his surgery, and his friends thank the doctors.

In the final scenes, Derek Shepherd tells Meredith that his interest in her is not just about the thrill of the chase, but something more genuine. Meredith remains firm in her refusal to date him. Chief Webber reports that Mackey’s surgery went smoothly, and Mackey jokes about having to quit smoking.

Meredith reflects in voiceover that true victories in medicine are measured by lives saved, not by competition. The interns gather at Meredith’s house, watching one of her mother’s surgical tapes together, finding a moment of camaraderie and relief after a difficult day.
