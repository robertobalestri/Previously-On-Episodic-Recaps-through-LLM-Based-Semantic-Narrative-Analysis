00:06:51,593 --> 00:06:51,954
Lloyd Mackey: Why not?

146
00:06:52,754 --> 00:06:53,576
George O'Malley: Oh, my god.

147
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:54,757
George O'Malley: You're in a hospital.

148
00:06:55,237 --> 00:06:55,939
Lloyd Mackey: Your point being?

149
00:06:58,182 --> 00:07:04,389
George O'Malley: I don't know if you've listened to the surgeon general lately say in the past 20 years, but smoking is bad.

150
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:06,230
George O'Malley: Smoking will kill you.

151
00:07:07,031 --> 00:07:09,434
Lloyd Mackey: Liver cancer will kill me.

152
00:07:09,454 --> 00:07:11,757
Lloyd Mackey: Smoking will just speed up the process.

153
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:15,560
George O'Malley: You're at the top of the donor list for a new liver.

154
00:07:16,485 --> 00:07:17,007
George O'Malley: There's hope.

155
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:22,533
Lloyd Mackey: Sweetheart, I've been at the top of the list for eight months.

156
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:25,076
Lloyd Mackey: I'm not in a batter's cage.

157
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:28,901
Lloyd Mackey: I'm in the dugout about to be traded.

158
00:07:30,524 --> 00:07:31,324
Lloyd Mackey: You like baseball?

159
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:32,466
George O'Malley: No.

160
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,088
Lloyd Mackey: Oh.

161
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,874
George O'Malley: Well, the chief wanted me to look in on you.

162
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:41,497
Lloyd Mackey: Richard's a dear old friend.

163
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,141
Lloyd Mackey: He's been my doctor for 30 years.

164
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,305
George O'Malley: Well, whatever you need, I'm your man.

165
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:49,807
George O'Malley: Just name it.

166
00:07:51,028 --> 00:07:54,334
Mr. Mackey / Bike Race Patient (PVM): Oh.

167
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:55,555
Mr. Mackey / Lloyd Mackey (PVM): I'm sure I'll think of something.

168
00:08:03,487 --> 00:08:04,810
Doctor (possibly George) / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Absent corneal reflexes.

169
00:08:06,593 --> 00:08:07,754
Izzy / Mrs. Stevenson (PVM): It's been 55 minutes.

170
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:14,576
Izzy / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): If he doesn't respond to these tests in the next five hours, what, we're supposed to just stand here and watch him die?

171
00:08:14,596 --> 00:08:18,281
George / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): If he doesn't respond to these tests, it's because he's already dead.

172
00:08:19,843 --> 00:08:20,903
George / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Technically, legally.

173
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:22,826
George / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Actually, Izzy, actually dead.

174
00:08:23,187 --> 00:08:23,788
Izzy / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): He's breathing.

175
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:24,749
Izzy / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): He has a heartbeat.

176
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,771
George / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Look at his EEG.

177
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,052
George / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): There's no higher brain function.

178
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:29,836
George / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): He'll never talk, move, or think again.

179
00:08:29,855 --> 00:08:31,358
George / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): There's no one in there.

180
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:33,220
George / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Think like a doctor, Izzy.

181
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:34,461
Izzy / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): He could wake up.

182
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:36,543
Izzy / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): What about a miracle?

183
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,165
Izzy / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): There are medical miracles, you know.

184
00:08:38,346 --> 00:08:38,687
George / Dr. Meredith Gray OR George O'Malley (PVM): I know.

185
00:08:39,678 --> 00:08:40,038
George / George O'Malley OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You're right.

186
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,201
George / George O'Malley OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Miracles happen.

187
00:08:42,844 --> 00:08:43,605
George / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): People do wake up.

188
00:08:44,284 --> 00:08:46,567
George / George O'Malley (PVM): See, that's why we do a series of tests over a set number of hours.

189
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:52,415
George / George O'Malley OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): So when we call time of death, we know that we've done everything in our power to make sure it's actually his time of death.

190
00:08:54,197 --> 00:08:55,317
George / Mackie (PVM): There isn't gonna be any miracles.

191
00:09:00,546 --> 00:09:01,385
George / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): This is the hard part.

192
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:04,571
George / George O'Malley OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): To stand around as surgeons and not cut.

193
00:09:05,772 --> 00:09:08,235
George / George O'Malley (PVM): But that's what do no harm means.

194
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,865
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I should just go into the light already so I can get on another case.

195
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,096
Cristina Yang / Mackie (PVM): Oh, I'm the devil because I'd rather be in surgery instead of standing watch over the death squad?

196
00:09:23,115 --> 00:09:23,856
Cristina Yang / Mackie (PVM): It's depressing.

197
00:09:29,846 --> 00:09:30,908
Izzy / Mrs. Stevenson (PVM): Look at his sneakers.

198
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:32,892
Izzy / Mrs. Stevenson (PVM): They're brand new.

199
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,716
Izzie Stevens / Mrs. Stevenson (PVM): And somebody sewed this tear in his shirt.

200
00:09:36,037 --> 00:09:37,639
George O'Malley / Mrs. Stevenson (PVM): And he has one of those electronic key cards.

201
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:39,942
Meredith Grey / Mrs. Stevenson (PVM): He belongs to someone.

202
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,652
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Mrs. Stevenson (PVM): An hour ago, he was out there alive.

203
00:09:43,432 --> 00:09:45,894
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): To simply stand here and wait for him to die.

204
00:09:45,913 --> 00:09:46,774
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): It would be a waste of life.

205
00:09:47,196 --> 00:09:47,677
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Exactly.

206
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,456
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): It would be a waste of organs.

207
00:09:58,287 --> 00:10:01,428
Alex Karev / Patient (Race Participant) (PVM): You got a nice touch.

208
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,431
Alex Karev / Patient (Race Participant) (PVM): And by the way, you are a rocking babe.

209
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:06,494
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Seriously, do you actually think you have a shot here?

210
00:10:06,634 --> 00:10:09,355
Alex Karev / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Patient (Race Participant) (PVM): I like to think I've got a shot anywhere.

211
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,488
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Look, you really have to let me take you for some tests.

212
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:13,408
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Run a CT.

213
00:10:13,668 --> 00:10:15,009
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You could have internal bleeding.

214
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:15,873
Patient (Race Participant) / Patient (Race Participant) (PVM): No, thank you.

215
00:10:15,893 --> 00:10:17,075
Patient (Race Participant): I've got a race to get back to.

216
00:10:18,056 --> 00:10:18,254
Izzie Stevens / Mackie (PVM): Why?

217
00:10:18,274 --> 00:10:19,437
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You can't win now anyway.

218
00:10:19,838 --> 00:10:21,519
Patient (Race Participant): Doesn't mean I can't cross that finish line.

219
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,485
Patient (Race Participant): There's a party at the finish line.

220
00:10:24,504 --> 00:10:27,088
Patient (Race Participant): Do you want to meet me there?

221
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:28,370
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): One test, a CT.

222
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:29,653
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Patient (Race Participant) (PVM): I'll have you out of here in an hour.

223
00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:30,374
Patient (Race Participant): Can't do it.

224
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:34,418
Patient (Race Participant): Got to go.

225
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,466
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): OK, well, you realize you're leaving up against medical advice, and then I strongly urge you to stay.

226
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:40,076
Patient (Race Participant): The frat guy said I could go.

227
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:41,998
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): The frat guy is an ass.

228
00:10:43,538 --> 00:10:43,899
Patient (Race Participant): Okay.

229
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,423
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Well, you have to sign an AMA form.

230
00:10:47,725 --> 00:10:50,388
Patient (Race Participant): Ellen, I will do anything you want me to.

231
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,832
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Patient (Race Participant) (PVM): What is it with you guys and your need to dirty everything up?

232
00:10:55,854 --> 00:10:56,394
Intern / Patient (Race Participant) (PVM): I don't know.

233
00:10:56,894 --> 00:10:58,375
Patient / Patient (Race Participant) (PVM): Maybe it's the testosterone, hey?

234
00:10:59,378 --> 00:10:59,697
Intern / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Maybe.

235
00:10:59,738 --> 00:11:03,000
Intern / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You might want to see a doctor about that, too.

236
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,061
Patient: That was for good luck.

237
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:20,364
Patient: Don't worry, darling, you'll see me again.

238
00:11:22,888 --> 00:11:24,288
Intern: For your sake, I hope not.

239
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:39,552
Intern / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): What do you want?

240
00:11:39,913 --> 00:11:41,153
Supervisor/Another Doctor / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Do you make out with patients now?

241
00:11:42,976 --> 00:11:43,719
Intern / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): What, are you jealous?

242
00:11:45,302 --> 00:11:46,302
Supervisor/Another Doctor / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I don't get jealous.

243
00:11:50,096 --> 00:11:51,379
Intern / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): We had sex once.

244
00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:53,081
Supervisor/Another Doctor / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): And we kissed in an elevator.

245
00:11:54,725 --> 00:11:56,567
Intern / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): And we kissed in an elevator once.

246
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:57,570
Supervisor/Another Doctor / George O'Malley (PVM): No, seriously.

247
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:59,231
Supervisor/Another Doctor / George O'Malley (PVM): Come on, go out with me.

248
00:11:59,653 --> 00:11:59,874
Intern / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): No.

249
00:12:01,056 --> 00:12:02,017
Supervisor/Another Doctor / George O'Malley (PVM): You know, I almost died today.

250
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:04,019
Intern / George O'Malley (PVM): Yeah, I came like this, Klaus.

251
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:08,288
Supervisor/Another Doctor / George O'Malley (PVM): How would you feel if I died and you didn't get a chance to go out with me?

252
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:10,211
Intern / Dr. Meredith Gray OR George O'Malley (PVM): Get over yourself already.

253
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:11,192
Supervisor/Another Doctor / Dr. Meredith Gray OR George O'Malley (PVM): Come on.

254
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,577
Intern / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): It's the chase, isn't it?

255
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,801
Supervisor/Another Doctor / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): What?

256
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,432
Intern / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): The thrill of the chase.

257
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:22,057
Intern / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I've been wondering to myself, why are you so hell-bent on getting me to go out with you?

258
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,441
Intern / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You know you're my boss.

259
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,783
Intern / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You know it's against the rules.

260
00:12:25,264 --> 00:12:26,326
Intern / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You know I keep saying no.

261
00:12:27,187 --> 00:12:27,726
Supervisor/Another Doctor / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): It's the chase.

262
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,072
Supervisor/Another Doctor / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Well, it's fun, isn't it?

263
00:12:30,471 --> 00:12:30,812
Intern / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): You see?

264
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:33,697
Intern / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): This is a game to you, but not to me.

265
00:12:34,778 --> 00:12:37,384
Character A / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Because unlike you, I still have something to prove.

266
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,003
Character B / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I know you see me resecting this bowel.

267
00:12:43,123 --> 00:12:45,547
Character B / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Do I strike you as someone who enjoys multitasking?

268
00:12:45,788 --> 00:12:46,668
Character A / Mackie (PVM): We have a John Doe.

269
00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:48,892
Character A / Mackie (PVM): In three hours, we have to declare him brain dead.

270
00:12:49,432 --> 00:12:50,475
Character A / Mackie (PVM): We want to harvest his organs.

271
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,277
Character B / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Jill, why are you wasting time on this?

272
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:54,220
Character B / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You know how many patients we have downstairs.

273
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,745
Jill / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): If he dies, and he could still live, you know, his death should mean something.

274
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:02,793
Character B / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Then you want to harvest surgery.

275
00:13:03,094 --> 00:13:04,534
Jill / Mackie (PVM): I want to save lives.

276
00:13:06,845 --> 00:13:08,125
Character B / Mackie OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): OK, I want a harvest surgery.

277
00:13:08,426 --> 00:13:10,869
Character B / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Getting organs from a John Doe is a long shot.

278
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:13,171
Character B / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Without ID, you can't contact the family.

279
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:16,514
Character B / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Without the family, you can't get consent to harvest the organs.

280
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:17,634
Character B / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Let's poor man die in peace.

281
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:18,995
Jill / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): What if we can find the family?

282
00:13:19,176 --> 00:13:20,157
Character B / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Then get consent.

283
00:13:20,397 --> 00:13:21,197
Jill / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): We could harvest the organs?

284
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:24,041
Character B / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): If you find the family.

285
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:29,225
Unknown Nurse/Doctor / George O'Malley OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Cardiac refusion is 4217.

286
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:30,966
Unknown Nurse/Doctor / George O'Malley OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Cardiac refusion is 4217.

287
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:31,648
Character C / Mackie OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): What are you doing?

288
00:13:31,726 --> 00:13:33,129
Character D / George O'Malley (PVM): Hiding.

289
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:34,450
Character D / Bike Race Patient OR George O'Malley (PVM): There's this VIP patient.

290
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:36,312
Character D / Bike Race Patient (PVM): He likes me.

291

309
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:27,754

310
00:14:28,336 --> 00:14:29,738
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Could you make sure the police get it?

311
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:30,418
Unknown / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): OK.

312
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,841

321
00:15:07,764 --> 00:15:17,279
Izzie / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): And you're feeling this big push to go towards the light where everything's all halos and all-you-can-eat buffets and stuff.

322
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:22,609
Izzie / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): And I mean, sharing your organs is really great and all.

323
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:23,769
Izzie / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): But I think you have a family.

324
00:15:25,653 --> 00:15:26,274
Izzie / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I can feel it.

325
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:32,985

326
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:39,173
Izzie / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Just live.

327
00:15:41,605 --> 00:15:43,091

334
00:16:16,457 --> 00:16:17,038

336
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,282

00:16:18,322 --> 00:16:18,883

338
00:16:19,283 --> 00:16:21,284

339
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:21,687
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): No.

340
00:16:22,245 --> 00:16:23,707

343
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,634

344
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:29,918

345
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:31,139
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): We're doctors.

346
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:33,581
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): We should have every right to make that call.

347
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:37,365
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): We can't just stand here and do nothing while he dies.

348
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:40,048

350
00:16:45,696 --> 00:16:46,495

352
00:16:47,918 --> 00:16:48,677

353
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:57,250

355
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,956

365
00:17:19,324 --> 00:17:26,992

366
00:17:27,272 --> 00:17:29,056

00:17:46,507 --> 00:17:48,567

373
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,769

374
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:52,510

375
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,772
Doctor (possibly Cristina) / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Mackie (PVM): If he's going to remain a viable organ donor, yeah.

376
00:17:54,794 --> 00:17:55,473
Another doctor (possibly Meredith or Izzie) / Mackie (PVM): If he's going to live.

377

382
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:01,660

383
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,182

384

385
00:18:06,144 --> 00:18:07,546

386
00:18:07,605 --> 00:18:07,924

387
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:09,748

388
00:18:11,729 --> 00:18:12,230

389

390
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:14,730

391
00:18:18,509 --> 00:18:22,894
Doctor (possibly Meredith) / Mackie (PVM): Um, I know you're busy, but our John Doe needs an aortic repair.

392
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:25,478
Dr. Burke / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): The guy from this morning?

393
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:27,519

394
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,823

395
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:30,825

396
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,469

397
00:18:35,068 --> 00:18:35,651
Burke / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): On whose orders?

398
00:18:40,135 --> 00:18:40,517
Mackey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Mine.

399
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:50,534
Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray OR George O'Malley OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): You get a brain-dead John Doe of blood transfusion without consulting anyone, and now you want me to repair his heart?

400
00:18:50,554 --> 00:18:51,394
Mackey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR George O'Malley (PVM): Well, yes.

401
00:18:55,641 --> 00:18:57,742

402
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,968
Mackey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): He is an excellent candidate for organ donation.

403
00:19:00,988 --> 00:19:01,587

404
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:02,528
Burke / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): I save lives.

405
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,070

406
00:19:04,673 --> 00:19:06,233
Mackey / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Now, this is the men's room.

407
00:19:06,894 --> 00:19:08,916
Mackey / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Either whip one out or close the door.

408
00:19:13,488 --> 00:19:14,429
Burke / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): You're asking my advice?

409
00:19:14,868 --> 00:19:15,088
Mackey / Unknown (PVM): Yes.

410
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,411

411
00:19:16,431 --> 00:19:16,951
Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Not funny.

412
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:17,913
Burke / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): This is important.

413
00:19:18,354 --> 00:19:19,795
Mackey / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): OK.

414
00:19:19,815 --> 00:19:20,556
Mackey / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): You want to get around Burke?

415
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:27,522
Mackey / Bike Race Patient OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): You got to find a way to get the chief involved.

416
00:19:27,544 --> 00:19:27,982
Burke / Bike Race Patient (PVM): What'd I do?

417
00:19:28,644 --> 00:19:31,228
Mackey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): How close a match for the liver is your guy to our John Doe?

418
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:32,067
George / Bike Race Patient (PVM): Very.

419
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:33,150
George / Bike Race Patient OR George O'Malley (PVM): Same type, same size.

420
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,592
George / George O'Malley (PVM): You knows couldn't find a better match.

421
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:34,872
Mackey / Mackie (PVM): Why?

422
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:37,075
Mackey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): He's the chief's VIP, right?

423
00:19:37,894 --> 00:19:38,194
George / George O'Malley (PVM): Right.

424
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:41,156
Mackey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): How much would you kill to be in on a transplant surgery?

425
00:19:43,118 --> 00:19:44,259
George / Bike Race Patient (PVM): You underestimate me.

426
00:19:44,902 --> 00:19:45,643
George / Bike Race Patient (PVM): I'm not a baby.

427
00:19:46,403 --> 00:19:47,242
George / Bike Race Patient (PVM): I'm your colleague.

428
00:19:48,266 --> 00:19:49,326
George / Bike Race Patient (PVM): You don't have to manipulate me.

429
00:19:49,365 --> 00:19:51,808
George / Bike Race Patient (PVM): If you want something, all you have to do is ask.

430
00:19:52,931 --> 00:19:56,673
Intern (possibly Cristina or Izzie) / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Mrs. Stevenson OR George O'Malley (PVM): We want you to go over Burke's head to the chief.

431
00:19:56,693 --> 00:19:57,756
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Ask me something easier.

432
00:19:59,438 --> 00:19:59,596
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Sir?

433
00:20:00,598 --> 00:20:01,098
Dr. Richard Webber / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Oh, Mally.

434
00:20:01,278 --> 00:20:01,819

473
00:22:17,054 --> 00:22:18,756
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Mrs. Stevenson (PVM): We can hold off till morning.

474
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:26,184
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): But if there's still no change, we'd like to talk to you about organ donation.

479
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:52,057
Mackie: You should reprimand him.

480
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:58,633
Mackie: Make him change bedpans.

481
00:22:58,653 --> 00:23:02,500

490
00:23:47,285 --> 00:23:51,132

491
00:23:51,152 --> 00:23:53,476

493
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,007

494
00:24:00,268 --> 00:24:03,854

495
00:24:04,114 --> 00:24:05,675
Dr. Meredith Gray: Just stay out of my face.

496
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:09,663

504
00:24:39,894 --> 00:24:40,472
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): What?

505
00:24:41,694 --> 00:24:42,016

508
00:25:01,931 --> 00:25:04,894

511
00:25:06,733 --> 00:25:08,896

512
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:10,439
Dr. Meredith Gray: Are those my mother's surgical tapes?

513
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:12,319
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Please watch the skin grafting one first.

514
00:25:13,733 --> 00:25:15,115

515
00:25:16,076 --> 00:25:17,617
Dr. Isobel Stevens: Oh, I unpacked some of your mother's things.

516
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:18,740

525
00:25:37,358 --> 00:25:38,779

526
00:25:40,853 --> 00:25:42,288

529
00:25:52,574 --> 00:25:56,538
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Izzy's all perky, and George does this thing where he's helpful and considerate.

530
00:25:57,077 --> 00:26:00,981
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): They share food, and they say things, and they move things, and they breathe.

531
00:26:02,202 --> 00:26:03,005
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): They're, like, happy.

532
00:26:04,286 --> 00:26:04,905

533
00:26:05,247 --> 00:26:06,228

536
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,089
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): So what?

537
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:15,738
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Mackie (PVM): You're just going to repress everything in some deep, dark, twisted place until one day you snap and kill them?

538
00:26:15,758 --> 00:26:15,836
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Yep.

539
00:26:15,856 --> 00:26:17,880

540
00:26:18,738 --> 00:26:21,800
George O'Malley / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Alex Karev (PVM): Why is the Nazi making us stay in the pit two days in a row?

541
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,021

543
00:26:23,962 --> 00:26:28,970

544
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,531
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Patient (Race Participant) (PVM): Well, meanwhile, she gets to do a freaking organ harvest.

545
00:26:31,553 --> 00:26:32,134
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Patient (Race Participant) (PVM): That kills me, doesn't it?

546
00:26:32,153 --> 00:26:32,374
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): What?

547
00:26:32,534 --> 00:26:33,934
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Patient (Race Participant) (PVM): That two women caught the harvest.

548
00:26:33,954 --> 00:26:36,076

549
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:38,519
Meredith Grey / Patient (Race Participant) OR Bike Race Patient (PVM): Boobs do not factor into this equation.

550
00:26:39,461 --> 00:26:40,123
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Bike Race Patient (PVM): Come on, son.

551
00:26:40,143 --> 00:26:45,147
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Meredith Gray OR Alex Karev OR Dr. Meredith Gray OR Bike Race Patient (PVM): You want to show me yours?

552
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:46,250
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): I'm going to become a lesbian.

553
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,089
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Me too.

554
00:26:53,549 --> 00:27:00,076
Organ Procurement Coordinator / Dr. Meredith Gray (PVM): Now, Mrs. Davidson, this form simply says you've consented the donation of your husband's major organs, heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys.

559
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:26,297
Mrs. Davidson: I suppose that's OK.

560
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:43,594

00:27:45,654 --> 00:27:45,875

564
00:27:58,231 --> 00:27:59,256

570
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:39,778

572
00:28:40,381 --> 00:28:41,721
