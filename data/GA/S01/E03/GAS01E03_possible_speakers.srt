George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Should I scrub in?

135
00:06:10,415 --> 00:06:10,656
Dr. Richard Webber / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): No.

136
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,298
Dr. Richard Webber / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I'm stuck here all day.

137
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:15,322
Dr. Richard Webber / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I need you on the floor monitoring my pre- and post-op patients.

138
00:06:16,302 --> 00:06:18,004
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Oh.

139
00:06:18,026 --> 00:06:19,348
Dr. Richard Webber / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You got a problem with that, O'Malley?

140
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:20,649
Dr. George O'Malley: Oh, uh, no, sir.

141
00:06:23,293 --> 00:06:26,317
Dr. Richard Webber / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Uh, a buddy of mine in 4451, Lloyd Mackey.

142
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:27,516
Dr. Richard Webber / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Give him whatever he needs.

143
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:48,629
Dr. George O'Malley: Mr. Mackey, no smoking.

144
00:06:50,632 --> 00:06:51,494
Dr. George O'Malley: There's no smoking.

145
00:06:51,593 --> 00:06:51,954
Mr. Lloyd Mackey: Why not?

146
00:06:52,754 --> 00:06:53,576
Dr. George O'Malley: Oh, my god.

147
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:54,757
Dr. George O'Malley: You're in a hospital.

148
00:06:55,237 --> 00:06:55,939
Mr. Lloyd Mackey: Your point being?

149
00:06:58,182 --> 00:07:04,389
Dr. George O'Malley: I don't know if you've listened to the surgeon general lately say in the past 20 years, but smoking is bad.

150
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:06,230
Dr. George O'Malley: Smoking will kill you.

151
00:07:07,031 --> 00:07:09,434
Liver Cancer Patient / Mr. Lloyd Mackey (PVM): Liver cancer will kill me.

152
00:07:09,454 --> 00:07:11,757
Liver Cancer Patient / Mr. Lloyd Mackey (PVM): Smoking will just speed up the process.

153
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:15,560
Izzy / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You're at the top of the donor list for a new liver.

154
00:07:16,485 --> 00:07:17,007
Izzy / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): There's hope.

155
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:22,533
Liver Cancer Patient / Mr. Lloyd Mackey (PVM): Sweetheart, I've been at the top of the list for eight months.

156
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:25,076
Liver Cancer Patient / Mr. Lloyd Mackey (PVM): I'm not in a batter's cage.

157
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:28,901
Liver Cancer Patient / Mr. Lloyd Mackey (PVM): I'm in the dugout about to be traded.

158
00:07:30,524 --> 00:07:31,324
Izzy / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You like baseball?

159
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:32,466
Liver Cancer Patient / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): No.

160
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,088
Izzy / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Oh.

161
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,874
Izzy / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Well, the chief wanted me to look in on you.

162
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:41,497
Liver Cancer Patient / Mr. Lloyd Mackey (PVM): Richard's a dear old friend.

163
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,141
Liver Cancer Patient / Mr. Lloyd Mackey (PVM): He's been my doctor for 30 years.

164
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,305
Izzy / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Well, whatever you need, I'm your man.

165
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:49,807
Izzy / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Just name it.

166
00:07:51,028 --> 00:07:54,334
Liver Cancer Patient / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Oh.

167
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:55,555
Liver Cancer Patient / Mr. Lloyd Mackey (PVM): I'm sure I'll think of something.

168
00:08:03,487 --> 00:08:04,810
Resident (possibly Izzy) / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Absent corneal reflexes.

169
00:08:06,593 --> 00:08:07,754
Resident (possibly Izzy) / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): It's been 55 minutes.

170
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:14,576
Izzy / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): If he doesn't respond to these tests in the next five hours, what, we're supposed to just stand here and watch him die?

171
00:08:14,596 --> 00:08:18,281
Another Resident / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): If he doesn't respond to these tests, it's because he's already dead.

172
00:08:19,843 --> 00:08:20,903
Another Resident / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Technically, legally.

173
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:22,826
Another Resident / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Actually, Izzy, actually dead.

174
00:08:23,187 --> 00:08:23,788
Izzy / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): He's breathing.

175
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:24,749
Izzy / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): He has a heartbeat.

176
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,771
Meredith Grey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Look at his EEG.

177
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,052
Miranda Bailey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): There's no higher brain function.

178
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:29,836
Miranda Bailey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): He'll never talk, move, or think again.

179
00:08:29,855 --> 00:08:31,358
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): There's no one in there.

180
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:33,220
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Think like a doctor, Izzy.

181
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:34,461
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): He could wake up.

182
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:36,543
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): What about a miracle?

183
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,165
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): There are medical miracles, you know.

184
00:08:38,346 --> 00:08:38,687
Meredith Grey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I know.

185
00:08:39,678 --> 00:08:40,038
Meredith Grey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You're right.

186
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,201
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Miracles happen.

187
00:08:42,844 --> 00:08:43,605
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): People do wake up.

188
00:08:44,284 --> 00:08:46,567
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): See, that's why we do a series of tests over a set number of hours.

189
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:52,415
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): So when we call time of death, we know that we've done everything in our power to make sure it's actually his time of death.

190
00:08:54,197 --> 00:08:55,317
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): There isn't gonna be any miracles.

191
00:09:00,546 --> 00:09:01,385
Meredith Grey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): This is the hard part.

192
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:04,571
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): To stand around as surgeons and not cut.

193
00:09:05,772 --> 00:09:08,235
Miranda Bailey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): But that's what do no harm means.

194
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,865
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I should just go into the light already so I can get on another case.

195
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,096
Cristina Yang / Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Oh, I'm the devil because I'd rather be in surgery instead of standing watch over the death squad?

196
00:09:23,115 --> 00:09:23,856
Meredith Grey / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): It's depressing.

197
00:09:29,846 --> 00:09:30,908
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Look at his sneakers.

198
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:32,892
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): They're brand new.

199
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,716
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): And somebody sewed this tear in his shirt.

200
00:09:36,037 --> 00:09:37,639
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): And he has one of those electronic key cards.

201
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:39,942
Resident / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): He belongs to someone.

202
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,652
Resident / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): An hour ago, he was out there alive.

203
00:09:43,432 --> 00:09:45,894
Resident / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): To simply stand here and wait for him to die.

204
00:09:45,913 --> 00:09:46,774
Resident / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): It would be a waste of life.

205
00:09:47,196 --> 00:09:47,677
Another Doctor / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Exactly.

206
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,456
Another Doctor / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): It would be a waste of organs.

207
00:09:58,287 --> 00:10:01,428
Patient: You got a nice touch.

208
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,431
Patient: And by the way, you are a rocking babe.

209
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:06,494
Dr. George O'Malley: Seriously, do you actually think you have a shot here?

210
00:10:06,634 --> 00:10:09,355
Patient: I like to think I've got a shot anywhere.

211
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,488
Dr. George O'Malley: Look, you really have to let me take you for some tests.

212
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:13,408
Dr. George O'Malley: Run a CT.

213
00:10:13,668 --> 00:10:15,009
Dr. George O'Malley: You could have internal bleeding.

214
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:15,873
Patient: No, thank you.

215
00:10:15,893 --> 00:10:17,075
Patient: I've got a race to get back to.

216
00:10:18,056 --> 00:10:18,254
Dr. George O'Malley: Why?

217
00:10:18,274 --> 00:10:19,437
Dr. George O'Malley: You can't win now anyway.

218
00:10:19,838 --> 00:10:21,519
Patient: Doesn't mean I can't cross that finish line.

219
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,485
Patient: There's a party at the finish line.

220
00:10:24,504 --> 00:10:27,088
Patient: Do you want to meet me there?

221
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:28,370
Dr. George O'Malley: One test, a CT.

222
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:29,653
Dr. George O'Malley: I'll have you out of here in an hour.

223
00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:30,374
Patient: Can't do it.

224
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:34,418
Patient: Got to go.

225
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,466
Dr. George O'Malley: OK, well, you realize you're leaving up against medical advice, and then I strongly urge you to stay.

226
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:40,076
Patient / Patient (PVM): The frat guy said I could go.

227
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:41,998
Ellen / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): The frat guy is an ass.

228
00:10:43,538 --> 00:10:43,899
Patient / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Okay.

229
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,423
Ellen / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Well, you have to sign an AMA form.

230
00:10:47,725 --> 00:10:50,388
Patient / Patient (PVM): Ellen, I will do anything you want me to.

231
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,832
Ellen / Patient OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): What is it with you guys and your need to dirty everything up?

232
00:10:55,854 --> 00:10:56,394
Patient / Patient (PVM): I don't know.

233
00:10:56,894 --> 00:10:58,375
Ellen / Patient (PVM): Maybe it's the testosterone, hey?

234
00:10:59,378 --> 00:10:59,697
Patient / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Maybe.

235
00:10:59,738 --> 00:11:03,000
Ellen / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You might want to see a doctor about that, too.

236
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,061
Patient / Patient (PVM): That was for good luck.

237
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:20,364
Patient / Patient (PVM): Don't worry, darling, you'll see me again.

238
00:11:22,888 --> 00:11:24,288
Ellen / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): For your sake, I hope not.

239
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:39,552
Ellen / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): What do you want?

240
00:11:39,913 --> 00:11:41,153
Romantic Interest / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Do you make out with patients now?

241
00:11:42,976 --> 00:11:43,719
Ellen / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): What, are you jealous?

242
00:11:45,302 --> 00:11:46,302
Romantic Interest / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I don't get jealous.

243
00:11:50,096 --> 00:11:51,379
Romantic Interest / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): We had sex once.

244
00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:53,081
Ellen / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): And we kissed in an elevator.

245
00:11:54,725 --> 00:11:56,567
Romantic Interest / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): And we kissed in an elevator once.

246
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:57,570
Ellen / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): No, seriously.

247
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:59,231
Romantic Interest / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Come on, go out with me.

248
00:11:59,653 --> 00:11:59,874
Ellen / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): No.

249
00:12:01,056 --> 00:12:02,017
Romantic Interest / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You know, I almost died today.

250
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:04,019
Resident / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Yeah, I came like this, Klaus.

251
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:08,288
Resident / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): How would you feel if I died and you didn't get a chance to go out with me?

252
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:10,211
Dr. Burke / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Get over yourself already.

253
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:11,192
Resident / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Come on.

254
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,577
Resident / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): It's the chase, isn't it?

255
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,801
Dr. Burke / Mrs. Davidson (PVM): What?

256
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,432
Resident / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): The thrill of the chase.

257
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:22,057
Resident / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I've been wondering to myself, why are you so hell-bent on getting me to go out with you?

258
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,441
Resident / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You know you're my boss.

259
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,783
Resident / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You know it's against the rules.

260
00:12:25,264 --> 00:12:26,326
Resident / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You know I keep saying no.

261
00:12:27,187 --> 00:12:27,726
Dr. Burke / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): It's the chase.

262
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,072
Dr. Burke / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Well, it's fun, isn't it?

263
00:12:30,471 --> 00:12:30,812
Dr. Burke / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You see?

264
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:33,697
Resident / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): This is a game to you, but not to me.

265
00:12:34,778 --> 00:12:37,384
Resident / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Because unlike you, I still have something to prove.

266
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,003
Dr. Burke / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I know you see me resecting this bowel.

267
00:12:43,123 --> 00:12:45,547
Dr. Burke / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Do I strike you as someone who enjoys multitasking?

268
00:12:45,788 --> 00:12:46,668
Resident / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): We have a John Doe.

269
00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:48,892
Resident / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): In three hours, we have to declare him brain dead.

270
00:12:49,432 --> 00:12:50,475
Resident / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): We want to harvest his organs.

271
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,277
Dr. Burke / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Jill, why are you wasting time on this?

272
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:54,220
Dr. Burke / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You know how many patients we have downstairs.

273
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,745
Resident / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): If he dies, and he could still live, you know, his death should mean something.

274
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:02,793
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Then you want to harvest surgery.

275
00:13:03,094 --> 00:13:04,534
Izzie Stevens / Mrs. Davidson (PVM): I want to save lives.

276
00:13:06,845 --> 00:13:08,125
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): OK, I want a harvest surgery.

277
00:13:08,426 --> 00:13:10,869

496
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:09,663

513
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:12,319

514
00:25:13,733 --> 00:25:15,115

526
00:25:40,853 --> 00:25:42,288

529
00:25:52,574 --> 00:25:56,538
Meredith Grey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Izzy's all perky, and George does this thing where he's helpful and considerate.

530
00:25:57,077 --> 00:26:00,981
Meredith Grey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): They share food, and they say things, and they move things, and they breathe.

531
00:26:02,202 --> 00:26:03,005
Meredith Grey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): They're, like, happy.

532

536
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,089
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): So what?

537
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:15,738
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You're just going to repress everything in some deep, dark, twisted place until one day you snap and kill them?

538
00:26:15,758 --> 00:26:15,836
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Yep.

539
00:26:15,856 --> 00:26:17,880

540
00:26:18,738 --> 00:26:21,800
Alex Karev / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Why is the Nazi making us stay in the pit two days in a row?

541
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,021
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Leftovers.

544
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,531
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Well, meanwhile, she gets to do a freaking organ harvest.

545
00:26:31,553 --> 00:26:32,134
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): That kills me, doesn't it?

546
00:26:32,153 --> 00:26:32,374
Izzie Stevens / Mrs. Davidson (PVM): What?

547
00:26:32,534 --> 00:26:33,934
George O'Malley / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): That two women caught the harvest.

548
00:26:33,954 --> 00:26:36,076
Alex Karev / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): No, it kills me that anybody got the harvest but me.

549
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:38,519
Izzie Stevens / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Boobs do not factor into this equation.

550
00:26:39,461 --> 00:26:40,123
Dr. Richard Webber / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Come on, son.
