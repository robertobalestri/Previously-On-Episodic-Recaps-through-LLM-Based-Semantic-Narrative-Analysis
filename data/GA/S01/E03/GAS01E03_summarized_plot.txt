Meredith Grey wakes up to Izzie Stevens, who is holding coffee and discussing their living arrangements with George O'Malley. After a brief argument about space and closets, Meredith shuts the door on them but reopens it to take Izzie's coffee. Meanwhile, Miranda Bailey is confused about an important event, which Derek Shepherd reminds her is "Dead baby bike race day," an illegal underground bike race. At the hospital, Miranda complains about the bikers, and the interns scramble to handle the influx of injured riders.

Meredith and Alex Karev argue over a patient, Viper, who wants to race despite his injuries. Meanwhile, Cristina Yang and Izzie Stevens deal with a critical patient, a man hit by a car while avoiding a bike. They discuss organ donation, and Izzie expresses hope for the patient's recovery. George O'Malley interacts with a patient, Lloyd Mackie, who is in need of a liver transplant.

As the day progresses, the interns face various challenges, including a potential organ donor situation. Meredith confronts Derek about his feelings, leading to tension between them. Izzie and Cristina seek permission to harvest organs from their patient, while George grapples with his feelings for Meredith.

In the operating room, the interns assist with surgeries, and Izzie decides to stay behind to sew up Mackie. Meanwhile, Viper's condition worsens, and Meredith rushes to help him. After a series of surgeries, they manage to save Mackie with a liver transplant.

Later, Meredith confronts Derek again, but he insists it's not just a game. Back at home, Meredith finds Izzie, Cristina, and George watching surgical tapes, leading to a moment of laughter and bonding among them.
