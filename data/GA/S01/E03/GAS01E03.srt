1
00:00:04,034 --> 00:00:06,744
We live out our lives on the surgical unit.

2
00:00:08,034 --> 00:00:09,171
7 days a week,

3
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:11,168
14 hours a day.

4
00:00:12,632 --> 00:00:14,746
We're together more than we're apart.

5
00:00:16,356 --> 00:00:18,187
George's room is bigger than mine.

6
00:00:23,797 --> 00:00:24,730
After a while...

7
00:00:24,802 --> 00:00:27,071
I have more clothes
- I should have the bigger room.

8
00:00:27,147 --> 00:00:28,391
...the ways of residency...

9
00:00:28,473 --> 00:00:30,735
- I got here first.
- Meredith should decide.

10
00:00:30,828 --> 00:00:32,201
...become the ways of life.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,278
My room is like two inches bigger than yours.

12
00:00:34,358 --> 00:00:35,922
- Number one...
- You have a bigger closet.

13
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:39,991
- Why is everything a competition?
- Always keep score.

14
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:44,854
Number two - do whatever you
can to outsmart the other guy.

15
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:47,433
Everywhere else is filled
with Meredith's mom's boxes.

16
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,612
Meredith? When is your mom
coming back to town, anyway?

17
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:52,927
Because maybe we can put her boxes in storage.

18
00:00:52,998 --> 00:00:55,221
Or unpack a few things -
make this place more homey.

19
00:00:55,281 --> 00:00:57,538
Some throw pillows, some lamps, a few paintings.

20
00:00:57,628 --> 00:00:59,275
Oh, paintings would be nice.

21
00:00:59,347 --> 00:01:01,953
Yeah. You have all this amazing stuff packed away.

22
00:01:02,032 --> 00:01:06,316
I found this box with tapes of your mother
performing amazing medical procedures.

23
00:01:06,387 --> 00:01:08,424
Really? We should watch them.
Do you want to watch -

24
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:16,084
Meredith, do you want some privacy?

25
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,274
Number three - don't make friends with the enemy.

26
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:29,734
- Morning, Dr. Bailey.
- Shut up.

27
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:37,308
You realize that I'm an attending and you're
only a resident - that you work for me, right?

28
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:41,102
I know I've forgotten something.
Something is happening today.

29
00:01:41,163 --> 00:01:43,901
I know I should know what
it is, but I just can't...

30
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,002
All right. Nice talking with you, Dr. Bailey.

31
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,763
It's right in front of my face.

32
00:02:06,707 --> 00:02:10,553
Fools on bikes, killing themselves
- natural selection is what it is.

33
00:02:10,802 --> 00:02:13,086
So what's up with the Nazi? Is she off her meds?

34
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,520
You never heard of the race?

35
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:19,613
Excellent board - well-timed, balanced, efficient.

36
00:02:19,718 --> 00:02:21,531
If all goes well, we'll have an early night.

37
00:02:21,602 --> 00:02:24,371
Chief, "dead baby" bike race
started 20 minutes ago.

38
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:27,093
All right, people! Dead baby bike-race day!

39
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:29,143
- Every year, this bar -
- The dead baby bar.

40
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:32,014
Every year, they hold this underground bike race.

41
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:35,221
Don't you wonder why someone would
name a bar something so disgusting?

42
00:02:35,277 --> 00:02:37,033
Keep your panties on, Nancy drew.

43
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:40,664
- The race is completely illegal and -
- Crazy.

44
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:45,092
Bike messengers racing against traffic, trying
to beat each other for free shots of tequila.

45
00:02:45,172 --> 00:02:48,235
All-out, no-holds-barred
competition sounds like fun.

46
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:52,729
The race doesn't even have any rules -
except eye-gouging - no eye-gouging.

47
00:02:52,823 --> 00:02:56,489
We're gonna be trapped in the pit band-aiding
idiots when we could be up in the O.R.

48
00:02:56,556 --> 00:02:59,954
What kind of people engage in a
race that has, as its only rule,

49
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:02,700
that you can't rip out the
eyeballs of another human being?

50
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:04,107
Men, Georgie. Men.

51
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:09,037
I need someone to get up to the O.R. Floor.
The chief needs a right hand.

52
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:11,772
Oh, and yeah, number four...

53
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:14,469
George.

54
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:18,265
...Everything. Everything is a competition.

55
00:03:18,351 --> 00:03:21,839
Okay, people. The rules of trauma -
don't mingle with E.R. Interns -

56
00:03:21,898 --> 00:03:23,829
they don't know their ass from their esophagus.

57
00:03:23,918 --> 00:03:27,043
Sew fast, discharge faster.
Get bodies up to the O.R.

58
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:30,155
And don't let me catch you
fighting over patients. Got it?

59
00:03:30,823 --> 00:03:31,739
Come on. Let's go.

60
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:42,333
Oh, it's like candy, but with
blood, which is so much better!

61
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:43,128
Oh, my god.

62
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,092
- Mine.
- No! I saw him first!

63
00:03:45,523 --> 00:03:47,588
Whoever said winning wasn't everything...

64
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:52,645
- Ooh. I'll take that guy.
- You'll have to beat me to him first.

65
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:54,217
...never held a scalpel.

66
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:24,431
Heads - he's mine. Tails - he's yours.

67
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:25,762
Why do you get to be "heads"?

68
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:28,158
Because I have a head, and, honey, you are a tail.

69
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:29,366
Excuse me.

70
00:04:29,908 --> 00:04:31,844
How do you manage to make everything dirty?

71
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,280
Ha! Tails.

72
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:36,755
There are plenty of other cases.

73
00:04:36,836 --> 00:04:38,730
So go get one. I was here first.

74
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:42,284
I am not backing down so I can do sutures
all day, while you're in the O.R.

75
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:44,439
This is a surgical case, and you know it.

76
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:45,596
It's superficial.

77
00:04:45,662 --> 00:04:47,461
It's cool, but it's superficial.

78
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,784
How do you know those things
didn't rupture his peritoneum?

79
00:04:49,862 --> 00:04:52,441
Because he's sitting up, and he's talking to us.

80
00:04:52,857 --> 00:04:53,640
Hello.

81
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,938
Excuse me. I was wondering
if you could take these

82
00:04:55,951 --> 00:04:58,172
out and sew me up so I
could go and win my race.

83
00:04:58,254 --> 00:04:59,650
Well, we can't just pull them out -

84
00:04:59,722 --> 00:05:03,512
- We have to... do some tests.
- Ow, wicked.

85
00:05:03,562 --> 00:05:04,916
Are you out of your mind?

86
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:07,203
It's a superficial wound.

87
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,794
Sew him up and let him finish his race.

88
00:05:10,082 --> 00:05:11,570
Hey, good man.

89
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:16,102
Unidentified John Doe, mid-30s pedestrian,
hit by a motorist swerving to avoid a bike.

90
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:17,531
G.C.S. 3.

91
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:19,235
Pupils fixed and dilated.

92
00:05:19,312 --> 00:05:21,311
Atropine given for a pulse in the 40s.

93
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:22,901
B.P. 183 over 112.

94
00:05:23,046 --> 00:05:24,377
Pulse-ox 98%.

95
00:05:24,453 --> 00:05:28,203
Chest showed widened mediastinum and head C.T.
revealed cerebral edema.

96
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,662
He's gotten 70 of mannitol, dexamethasone
10, and a gram of phenytoin.

97
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,050
Get him to the O.R.?

98
00:05:33,694 --> 00:05:35,374
- Is he gorked?
- Looks like.

99
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,903
The bike race claims its first victim.

100
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,396
I'll make my triple-a repair after all.

101
00:05:42,363 --> 00:05:44,969
Uh, Dr. Shepherd? He's not going to the O.R.?

102
00:05:45,236 --> 00:05:48,747
No. Do an E.E.G. and confirmatory tests.

103
00:05:48,809 --> 00:05:52,592
If he doesn't respond in six hours, declare him.

104
00:05:54,843 --> 00:05:55,918
"Declare him"?

105
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:57,149
Declare him what?

106
00:05:57,242 --> 00:05:58,066
Brain-dead.

107
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:10,186
Sir, Dr. Bailey sent me to assist you.
Should I scrub in?

108
00:06:10,257 --> 00:06:12,360
No. I'm stuck here all day.

109
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:15,413
I need you on the floor, monitoring
my pre- and post-op patients.

110
00:06:15,972 --> 00:06:16,632
Oh.

111
00:06:17,758 --> 00:06:19,171
You got a problem with that, Oâ€™Malley?

112
00:06:19,268 --> 00:06:20,871
Oh, uh, no, sir.

113
00:06:22,513 --> 00:06:27,440
A buddy of mine in 4451, Lloyd
Mackie - give him whatever he needs.

114
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:30,480
Yes, sir.

115
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:46,794
Mr. Mackie...

116
00:06:47,684 --> 00:06:48,765
no smoking!

117
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:52,221
- There's no smoking.
- Why not?

118
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,842
Oh, my god - you're in a hospital!

119
00:06:55,072 --> 00:06:56,147
Your point being...?

120
00:06:57,902 --> 00:07:01,334
I don't know if you've listened
to the surgeon general lately -

121
00:07:01,411 --> 00:07:04,622
say, in the past 20 years - but smoking is bad.

122
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:06,408
Smoking will kill you.

123
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:08,677
Liver cancer will kill me.

124
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:11,937
Smoking will just speed up the process.

125
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:15,713
You're at the top of the
donor list for a new liver.

126
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,236
There's hope.

127
00:07:18,241 --> 00:07:20,228
Sweetheart, I've been at
the top of the list for...

128
00:07:21,512 --> 00:07:22,741
eight months.

129
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:25,368
I'm not in a batters cage.

130
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:29,413
I'm in a dugout, about to be traded.

131
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:31,610
You like baseball?

132
00:07:31,704 --> 00:07:32,705
No.

133
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,158
Um, well, um, the chief
wanted me to look in on you.

134
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:41,721
Richard's a dear old friend.

135
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,085
He's been my doctor for 30 years.

136
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:48,474
Well, whatever you need - I'm your man.

137
00:07:48,996 --> 00:07:49,976
Just name it.

138
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:51,541
Well...

139
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:55,752
I'm sure I'll think of something.

140
00:08:03,185 --> 00:08:04,875
Absent corneal reflexes.

141
00:08:06,473 --> 00:08:07,844
It's been 55 minutes.

142
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,854
If he doesn't respond to these
tests in the next 5 hours, what?

143
00:08:11,954 --> 00:08:14,839
We're supposed to just stand
here and watch him die?

144
00:08:14,905 --> 00:08:18,730
If he doesn't respond to these tests,
it's because he's already dead.

145
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,938
Technically. Legally.

146
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:23,012
Actually, Izzie. Actually dead.

147
00:08:23,097 --> 00:08:24,901
He's breathing. He has a heartbeat.

148
00:08:24,976 --> 00:08:27,228
Look at his E.E.G.
- There's no higher-brain function.

149
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,158
He'll never talk, move, or think again.

150
00:08:30,383 --> 00:08:31,622
There's no one in there.

151
00:08:32,032 --> 00:08:33,444
Think like a doctor, Izzie.

152
00:08:33,543 --> 00:08:34,786
He could wake up.

153
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:36,630
What about a miracle?

154
00:08:36,721 --> 00:08:38,170
There are medical miracles, you know.

155
00:08:38,248 --> 00:08:40,383
I know. You're right.

156
00:08:40,484 --> 00:08:41,535
Miracles happen.

157
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:46,900
People do wake up. That's why we do a
series of tests over a set number of hours.

158
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,918
So when we call "time of death,"
we know that we've done everything

159
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:52,732
to make sure it's actually his time of death.

160
00:08:53,672 --> 00:08:55,635
That there's isn't going to be any miracles.

161
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:01,682
This is the hard part -

162
00:09:02,321 --> 00:09:04,953
to stand around as surgeons and not cut.

163
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:08,492
That's what "do no harm" means.

164
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:15,245
I wish he'd just go into the light
so I can get on another case.

165
00:09:18,532 --> 00:09:20,837
Oh, I'm the devil because I'd rather be in surgery

166
00:09:20,877 --> 00:09:23,068
instead of standing watch over the death squad?

167
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:24,210
It's depressing.

168
00:09:29,757 --> 00:09:30,979
Look at his sneakers.

169
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:33,145
They're brand-new.

170
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:35,894
And somebody sewed this tear in his shirt.

171
00:09:35,972 --> 00:09:37,917
And he has one of those electronic key cards.

172
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:39,930
He belongs to someone.

173
00:09:40,601 --> 00:09:43,072
An hour ago, he was out there, alive.

174
00:09:43,268 --> 00:09:45,899
To simply stand here and wait for him to die -

175
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,855
- It would be a waste of life.
- Exactly.

176
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:49,725
A waste of organs.

177
00:09:58,051 --> 00:09:59,488
You've got a nice touch.

178
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:03,460
And, by the way, you are a rockin' babe.

179
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:06,522
Seriously - do you actually
think you have a shot here?

180
00:10:06,594 --> 00:10:08,284
I'd like to think I've got a shot anywhere.

181
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,132
Look, you have really have to let
me take you for some tests. A C.T.

182
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,124
You could have internal bleeding.

183
00:10:15,212 --> 00:10:17,500
No, thank you. I've got a race to get back to.

184
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:19,691
Why? You can't win now, anyway.

185
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:21,816
Doesn't mean I can't cross that finish line.

186
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:23,864
There's a party at the finish line.

187
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,640
Do you want to meet me there?

188
00:10:26,716 --> 00:10:29,655
One test. A C.T. I'll have
you out of here in an hour.

189
00:10:29,744 --> 00:10:31,218
I can't do it. Got to go.

190
00:10:34,105 --> 00:10:38,631
Okay. Well, you realize you're leaving against
medical advice and that I urge you to stay.

191
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,413
The frat guy said I could go.

192
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:42,303
The "frat guy" is an ass.

193
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:46,669
Okay, well, you have to sign an A.M.A. form.

194
00:10:47,498 --> 00:10:50,816
Darling, I will do anything you want me to.

195
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:55,609
What is it with you guys and your
need to dirty everything up?

196
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:56,628
I don't know.

197
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,691
Maybe it's just testosterone.

198
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:00,063
Maybe.

199
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,921
You might want to see a doctor about that, too.

200
00:11:03,985 --> 00:11:04,826
Come here.

201
00:11:17,246 --> 00:11:18,373
That was for good luck.

202
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,615
Don't worry, darling, you'll see me again.

203
00:11:22,776 --> 00:11:24,886
For your sake, I hope not.

204
00:11:38,705 --> 00:11:39,774
What do you want?

205
00:11:39,847 --> 00:11:41,432
You make out with patients now?

206
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:44,029
What, are you jealous?

207
00:11:45,062 --> 00:11:46,236
I don't get jealous.

208
00:11:49,978 --> 00:11:51,447
We had sex - once.

209
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,347
And we kissed in an elevator.

210
00:11:54,484 --> 00:11:56,716
And we kissed in an elevator - once.

211
00:11:56,855 --> 00:11:57,852
No, seriously.

212
00:11:58,074 --> 00:11:59,373
Go out with me.

213
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,167
No.

214
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:02,195
You know, I almost died today.

215
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:04,171
Yeah, I came like this close.

216
00:12:04,843 --> 00:12:08,641
How would you feel if I died and you
didn't get a chance to go out with me?

217
00:12:08,954 --> 00:12:11,201
- Get over yourself, already.
- Come on.

218
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,801
It's the chase, isn't it?

219
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,958
What?

220
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:17,709
The thrill of the chase.

221
00:12:17,924 --> 00:12:19,522
I've been wondering to myself,

222
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:22,434
"why are you so hell-bent on
getting me to go out with you?"

223
00:12:22,521 --> 00:12:25,020
You know you're my boss, you
know it's against the rules,

224
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:28,256
you know I keep saying no - it's the chase.

225
00:12:28,973 --> 00:12:30,335
Well, it's fun, isn't it?

226
00:12:30,422 --> 00:12:31,318
You see?

227
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,705
This is a game to you.

228
00:12:32,874 --> 00:12:34,026
But not to me.

229
00:12:34,328 --> 00:12:37,615
Because, unlike you, I still
have something to prove.

230
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,058
I know you see me resecting this bowel.

231
00:12:43,132 --> 00:12:45,664
Do I strike you as someone
who enjoys multitasking?

232
00:12:45,746 --> 00:12:49,064
We have a John Doe. In three hours,
we have to declare him brain-dead.

233
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:50,671
We want to harvest his organs.

234
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:52,162
Why are you wasting time on this?

235
00:12:52,224 --> 00:12:54,158
You know how many patients we have downstairs.

236
00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:57,179
If he dies - and he could still live -

237
00:12:57,358 --> 00:12:59,104
his death should mean something.

238
00:13:00,973 --> 00:13:02,785
And you want a harvest surgery.

239
00:13:02,893 --> 00:13:04,297
I want to save lives.

240
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:08,310
Okay, I want a harvest surgery.

241
00:13:08,392 --> 00:13:10,819
Getting organs from a John Doe is a long shot.

242
00:13:10,886 --> 00:13:13,036
Without I.D., you can't contact the family.

243
00:13:13,118 --> 00:13:16,075
Without the family, you can't get
consent to harvest the organs.

244
00:13:16,131 --> 00:13:17,771
Let the poor man die in peace.

245
00:13:17,843 --> 00:13:18,960
What if we can find the family?

246
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,283
And get consent.

247
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:21,657
We could harvest the organs?

248
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:24,418
If you find the family.

249
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:30,793
What are you doing?

250
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,303
Hiding.

251
00:13:32,973 --> 00:13:34,678
There's this V.I.P. patient -

252
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:36,301
he likes me.

253
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,930
That's good, right?

254
00:13:38,463 --> 00:13:40,771
He likes me likes me.

255
00:13:41,073 --> 00:13:43,105
Go for it, man. Get yours.

256
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:44,600
I'm down with the rainbow.

257
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,117
Oh. Are you not gay?

258
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,238
No.

259
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:54,626
Really?

260
00:13:56,141 --> 00:13:57,243
Dude, sorry.

261
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:04,446
Uh, Cristina?

262
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,696
Do you - do you think -

263
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,786
Does Meredith think I'm gay?

264
00:14:11,404 --> 00:14:12,260
Are you?

265
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:13,888
No.

266
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:15,019
Really?

267
00:14:19,668 --> 00:14:22,971
Hey, I found this on our John Doe.
It's a hotel key card.

268
00:14:23,016 --> 00:14:25,550
The police are going to
send someone over, figure

269
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:28,107
out what hotel he was
staying at - get his I.D.

270
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,965
- Could you -
- I'll make sure the police get it.

271
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:31,771
Okay. It's really important.

272
00:14:31,853 --> 00:14:36,374
We only have a few hours before we have to declare
him, and I'd really like to find his family.

273
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:39,044
You want their permission for organ donation?

274
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,692
I just... really want to find them.

275
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:47,614
You have a potential donor?

276
00:14:49,197 --> 00:14:50,410
What's his blood type?

277
00:14:50,747 --> 00:14:51,859
Uh, O-neg.

278
00:15:03,143 --> 00:15:04,070
Okay.

279
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,264
I know you probably can't hear me

280
00:15:07,566 --> 00:15:10,848
and you're feeling this big
push to go towards the light,

281
00:15:10,915 --> 00:15:15,427
where everything's all halos and
all-you-can-eat buffets and stuff.

282
00:15:17,034 --> 00:15:20,305
And, I mean, sharing your
organs is really great and all.

283
00:15:22,446 --> 00:15:23,956
But I think you have a family.

284
00:15:25,405 --> 00:15:26,512
I can feel it.

285
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:30,940
So I think it'd be really great
if you could do me a favor and...

286
00:15:32,184 --> 00:15:33,142
get better.

287
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:35,696
Just...

288
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,280
live.

289
00:15:41,428 --> 00:15:43,448
So, you think you can give that a shot, for me?

290
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,540
Oh, no.

291
00:16:11,385 --> 00:16:12,109
Meredith!

292
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:13,795
Meredith.

293
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:14,941
- What?
- He's crashing.

294
00:16:15,202 --> 00:16:16,922
Well, what are you doing? Call a code!

295
00:16:16,995 --> 00:16:19,089
I can't - I'm not supposed to. He's brain-dead.

296
00:16:19,156 --> 00:16:21,255
If he's brain-dead, you have to let him go.

297
00:16:21,317 --> 00:16:23,538
No. It's only been 5 hours and 33 minutes.

298
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:25,264
He's supposed to get six hours.

299
00:16:25,327 --> 00:16:28,710
We can't do anything. It's not
our place to make that call.

300
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,914
He's a person.

301
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:31,233
We're doctors.

302
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:33,456
We should have every right to make that call.

303
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:37,763
We can't just stand here and
do nothing while he dies.

304
00:16:37,845 --> 00:16:40,379
He has a right to the next 27 minutes.

305
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,522
Screw it. I'll get the dopamine.

306
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:48,854
You get the blood. We'll transfuse him.

307
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,347
Do you feel any pain here?

308
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:58,918
No.

309
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:03,732
You know, you really do have...
beautiful eyelashes.

310
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:06,962
Um... thank you.

311
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:08,518
Uh, what about here?

312
00:17:09,164 --> 00:17:09,968
No.

313
00:17:10,741 --> 00:17:12,061
And nice eyes.

314
00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:13,397
Kind.

315
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,516
I like a man with kind eyes.

316
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,549
Really? You think I have kind eyes?

317
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:21,723
I mean, uh... you can, um...

318
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:27,013
What are you examining me for?

319
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:29,368
Oh, you know, just routine medical stuff.

320
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:30,965
You're doing very well.

321
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,771
Because I'm enjoying the view.

322
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,411
Okay... well...

323
00:17:39,173 --> 00:17:40,150
I got to go.

324
00:17:44,636 --> 00:17:45,655
He's stable.

325
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:48,230
For now. I had a radiologist look at his chest.

326
00:17:48,347 --> 00:17:50,114
He has a traumatic aortic injury.

327
00:17:50,186 --> 00:17:51,542
It's gonna rupture and bleed out.

328
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:52,614
So he needs surgery.

329
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,660
If he's gonna remain a viable organ donor.

330
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:55,731
If he's gonna live.

331
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,820
- Izzie -
- No. I'm not giving up on him.

332
00:17:57,892 --> 00:18:00,105
He has the surgery - he lives longer.
That's the point.

333
00:18:00,155 --> 00:18:03,426
I'm going to find the family.
You guys get him into surgery.

334
00:18:03,846 --> 00:18:05,857
She's vice president of fantasyland.

335
00:18:05,986 --> 00:18:08,249
Who do we go to for surgery - Bailey?

336
00:18:08,572 --> 00:18:09,995
We need to go higher than Bailey.

337
00:18:11,536 --> 00:18:12,401
Dr. Burke.

338
00:18:13,312 --> 00:18:14,466
- Hello!
- Okay.

339
00:18:18,322 --> 00:18:23,159
Dr. Burke, um, I know you're busy, but
our John Doe needs an aortic repair.

340
00:18:24,532 --> 00:18:25,775
The guy from this morning?

341
00:18:26,507 --> 00:18:27,731
Isn't he legally dead?

342
00:18:28,294 --> 00:18:31,234
Well, yeah - he's kinda still around.

343
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:34,782
We gave him two units P.R.V.C.S
and put him on pressors.

344
00:18:34,884 --> 00:18:35,985
On whose orders?

345
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:40,629
Mine.

346
00:18:44,606 --> 00:18:48,513
You get a brain-dead John Doe a blood
transfusion without consulting anyone.

347
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,290
And now you want me to repair his heart?

348
00:18:50,424 --> 00:18:51,806
Well, yes.

349
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,622
You do enjoy crossing the line, don't you?

350
00:18:57,688 --> 00:19:00,628
He is an excellent candidate for organ donation.

351
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,772
I am a surgeon. I save lives.

352
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,402
This guy is already dead.

353
00:19:04,494 --> 00:19:06,521
Now, this is the men's room.

354
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:08,984
Either whip one out or close the door.

355
00:19:13,295 --> 00:19:15,235
- You're asking my advice?
- Yes.

356
00:19:15,312 --> 00:19:18,027
- Now who's chasing?
- Not funny. This is important.

357
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:18,994
Okay.

358
00:19:19,638 --> 00:19:20,800
You want to get around Burke?

359
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:23,900
You gotta find a way to get the chief involved.

360
00:19:27,337 --> 00:19:28,322
What'd I do?

361
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:31,511
How close a match for the liver
is your guy to our John Doe?

362
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:35,281
Very. Same type, same size. U.N.O.S.
couldn't find a better match. Why?

363
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,277
He's the chief's V.I.P., right?

364
00:19:37,637 --> 00:19:38,404
Right.

365
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:41,443
How much would you kill to be
in on a transplant surgery?

366
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,585
You underestimate me.

367
00:19:44,721 --> 00:19:45,977
I'm not a baby.

368
00:19:46,196 --> 00:19:47,440
I'm your colleague.

369
00:19:47,948 --> 00:19:49,218
You don't have to manipulate me.

370
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,177
If you want something, all you have to do is ask.

371
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,854
We want you to go over Burke's head, to the chief.

372
00:19:56,098 --> 00:19:58,158
Ask me something easier.

373
00:19:59,273 --> 00:19:59,964
Sir.

374
00:20:00,313 --> 00:20:01,725
Oâ€™Malley. How's Mackie?

375
00:20:01,788 --> 00:20:04,625
Fine. Actually, that's what I
want to talk to you about.

376
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:09,605
I kinda think that - me and the
other interns - we think -

377
00:20:10,148 --> 00:20:12,478
Oâ€™Malley, I'm not getting any younger.

378
00:20:13,032 --> 00:20:14,609
We found Mackie a liver.

379
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:17,321
We are so going to hell.

380
00:20:17,403 --> 00:20:18,710
Burke is sending us straight to hell.

381
00:20:18,746 --> 00:20:20,035
On an express train.

382
00:20:20,102 --> 00:20:21,053
If it works.

383
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:23,733
What are you doing?

384
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:24,743
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

385
00:20:31,627 --> 00:20:32,468
Yes!

386
00:20:39,995 --> 00:20:40,993
Oh, crap.

387
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,304
Dr. Burke!

388
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:48,544
Dr. Burke!

389
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:52,066
Excellent work, sir.

390
00:20:52,676 --> 00:20:53,664
Excellent.

391
00:20:54,406 --> 00:20:55,153
Flawless.

392
00:20:55,718 --> 00:20:56,858
It's a shame he's brain-dead.

393
00:20:56,909 --> 00:20:59,895
If he wasn't, he would be
on his feet in a few days.

394
00:20:59,977 --> 00:21:02,438
I'm amazed at what's going on.

395
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,258
I seriously hate that guy.

396
00:21:04,476 --> 00:21:05,814
Alex is vermin.

397
00:21:05,947 --> 00:21:07,702
That surgery is ours.

398
00:21:07,882 --> 00:21:09,341
At least Burke is doing the surgery.

399
00:21:09,432 --> 00:21:10,770
I don't care about Alex.

400
00:21:11,118 --> 00:21:13,268
George, you did good.

401
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:17,052
I'm going to have to dodge Burke
for the rest of my career.

402
00:21:18,563 --> 00:21:21,296
He could kill me and make
it look like an accident.

403
00:21:24,502 --> 00:21:25,715
The police called.

404
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:29,007
They've identified your John Doe.
His wife is on the way.

405
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:45,529
Oh, my god.

406
00:21:47,282 --> 00:21:48,289
Kevin!

407
00:21:49,912 --> 00:21:51,710
- It's okay.
- Oh, my god!

408
00:21:51,967 --> 00:21:54,880
Mrs. Davidson, this is Dr. Stevens.

409
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:00,142
Now, if you have any questions
at all, please call me.

410
00:22:10,736 --> 00:22:13,968
Is there - is there still a chance?

411
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:19,005
We can hold off till morning,

412
00:22:19,866 --> 00:22:21,944
but if there's still no change, we'd...

413
00:22:23,231 --> 00:22:26,583
we'd like to talk to you about organ donation.

414
00:22:39,136 --> 00:22:39,951
Mackie?

415
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:42,716
How are we treating ya?

416
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:45,000
Oh, fine.

417
00:22:47,052 --> 00:22:49,613
Except that beautiful boy won't let me smoke.

418
00:22:50,616 --> 00:22:52,392
You should reprimand him.

419
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:55,106
Make him change bedpans.

420
00:22:58,332 --> 00:22:59,162
Mackie.

421
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,766
That beautiful boy may have found you a liver.

422
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:31,182
God, I smell good!

423
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:34,480
You know what it is?

424
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:37,854
It's the smell of open-heart surgery.

425
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:41,985
It's awesome. It is awesome.

426
00:23:42,481 --> 00:23:43,516
You gotta smell me.

427
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,784
I don't want to smell you.

428
00:23:45,866 --> 00:23:47,163
Oh, yes, you do.

429
00:23:47,243 --> 00:23:49,533
You have got to be kidding me!

430
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,573
Okay, I have more important
things to deal with than you.

431
00:23:53,624 --> 00:23:57,008
I have roommates, boy problems,
and family problems.

432
00:23:57,069 --> 00:24:00,074
You wanna act like a little frat-boy bitch?
That's fine.

433
00:24:00,135 --> 00:24:02,807
You wanna take credit for your
saves and everybody else's?

434
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:03,904
That's fine, too.

435
00:24:03,969 --> 00:24:05,733
Just stay outta my face.

436
00:24:05,795 --> 00:24:09,670
And for the record, you smell like crap!

437
00:24:16,477 --> 00:24:17,855
She attacked me.

438
00:24:18,655 --> 00:24:20,319
Meri! Meri! Meri! Meri!

439
00:24:23,124 --> 00:24:25,484
You know what? You might want to
leave before I change my mind

440
00:24:25,536 --> 00:24:29,269
and let her beat you to a pulp
with her tiny, ineffectual fists.

441
00:24:39,627 --> 00:24:40,389
What?

442
00:24:41,357 --> 00:24:42,274
Nothing.

443
00:24:44,492 --> 00:24:45,541
It's just...

444
00:24:52,176 --> 00:24:52,975
nothing.

445
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:04,760
Oh! This one is skin grafting!

446
00:25:04,853 --> 00:25:06,384
Skin grafting? No way!

447
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:08,172
I've never seen that done before.

448
00:25:08,652 --> 00:25:10,337
Are those my mother's surgical tapes?

449
00:25:10,403 --> 00:25:12,348
We should watch the skin grafting one first.

450
00:25:13,244 --> 00:25:15,512
Where did all this stuff come from?

451
00:25:15,774 --> 00:25:19,001
Oh. I unpacked some of your
mother's things. I was upset.

452
00:25:19,071 --> 00:25:20,916
And when I'm upset, I like to nest.

453
00:25:22,627 --> 00:25:24,519
Oooh - hemipelvectomy!

454
00:25:25,074 --> 00:25:26,783
I think we should watch this one first.

455
00:25:26,889 --> 00:25:28,355
No. No.

456
00:25:28,964 --> 00:25:32,661
We're not watching my mother's surgery tapes.
We're not unpacking boxes.

457
00:25:32,737 --> 00:25:36,884
We're not having long conversations where
we celebrate the moments of our lives.

458
00:25:37,115 --> 00:25:38,544
And use a coaster!

459
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,959
I ordered chinese food.

460
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:43,894
I hate chinese food!

461
00:25:50,523 --> 00:25:52,715
They're everywhere. All the time.

462
00:25:52,816 --> 00:25:56,626
Izzie's all perky, and George does this
thing where he's helpful and considerate.

463
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:00,912
They share food and they say things and
they move things and they breathe.

464
00:26:01,939 --> 00:26:02,944
They're like happy.

465
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:04,905
Kick them out.

466
00:26:04,987 --> 00:26:08,474
I can't kick them out. They just moved in.
I asked them to move in.

467
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:11,806
So, what - you're gonna repress everything
in some deep, dark, twisted place

468
00:26:11,852 --> 00:26:13,322
until one day you snap and kill them?

469
00:26:13,836 --> 00:26:14,551
Yep.

470
00:26:15,638 --> 00:26:16,917
This is why we are friends.

471
00:26:18,546 --> 00:26:21,397
Why is the Nazi making us stay
in the pit two days in a row?

472
00:26:21,575 --> 00:26:22,441
Leftovers.

473
00:26:22,705 --> 00:26:23,552
Leftovers.

474
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:28,882
Got to get the cyclists who were too drunk,
stupid, or scared to get to a hospital yesterday.

475
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,207
Meanwhile, she gets to do
a freakin' organ harvest.

476
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,648
It kills you, doesn't it? That
women caught the harvest.

477
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,470
No, it kills me that anybody
got the harvest but me.

478
00:26:36,573 --> 00:26:38,743
Boobs do not factor into this equation.

479
00:26:39,142 --> 00:26:41,202
Unless, uh, you want to show me yours.

480
00:26:44,576 --> 00:26:47,120
- I'm gonna become a lesbian.
- Me too.

481
00:26:53,432 --> 00:26:56,658
Now, Mrs. Davidson, this form simply
says you consent to the donation

482
00:26:56,726 --> 00:27:00,300
of your husband's major organs -
heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys.

483
00:27:06,607 --> 00:27:08,527
Now, I need to ask you a few questions.

484
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:10,477
Are you willing to donate his corneas?

485
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:13,596
You want his eyes?

486
00:27:16,955 --> 00:27:20,836
Um, corneal transplants can
give someone back their sight.

487
00:27:24,988 --> 00:27:26,545
I suppose that's okay.

488
00:27:42,606 --> 00:27:43,748
What about his skin?

489
00:27:45,172 --> 00:27:46,097
What?

490
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,445
It's used to help burn victims.

491
00:27:52,924 --> 00:27:55,442
You want to cut off his skin?

492
00:27:58,032 --> 00:27:59,620
What about the funeral?

493
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:04,032
You want me to have a funeral
and have people look at him -

494
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:09,129
have his daughter look at her father
and he doesn't have any skin?

495
00:28:09,942 --> 00:28:11,679
It's his skin!

496
00:28:34,396 --> 00:28:35,281
What are you doing?

497
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:38,047
I'm not a people person.

498
00:28:38,194 --> 00:28:39,037
No kidding.

499
00:28:39,198 --> 00:28:42,368
I can't do that. I can't talk to the
families of patients. I'm sorry.

500
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,020
What's his name?

501
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:48,353
- Who?
- The patient. What's his name?

502
00:28:50,825 --> 00:28:51,999
Kevin Davidson.

503
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:56,592
Remember that. Not "gorked guy."
Not "John Doe." Kevin Davidson.

504
00:28:56,653 --> 00:29:01,522
He's someone's husband, someone's son - not
a collection of body parts to harvest.

505
00:29:01,598 --> 00:29:02,515
A person.

506
00:29:03,381 --> 00:29:05,050
Now, no one said this was easy.

507
00:29:26,142 --> 00:29:27,347
I owe you, George.

508
00:29:28,823 --> 00:29:30,287
No, you don't owe me anything.

509
00:29:30,516 --> 00:29:32,591
I'm just happy we found a liver.

510
00:29:34,885 --> 00:29:36,615
Well, when I get out of here,

511
00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:41,239
how about I take you and my new
liver out for a night on the town?

512
00:29:42,344 --> 00:29:43,287
What do you say?

513
00:29:47,623 --> 00:29:51,356
Uh, Mr. Mackie, no offense or anything...

514
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:54,295
you're very handsome, but, I, um...

515
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:58,144
I'm not... I mean, you're not my type, because...

516
00:29:59,195 --> 00:30:01,058
you're a man, and...

517
00:30:01,586 --> 00:30:03,701
George, I never thought you were gay.

518
00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:08,430
- You didn't?
- Oh, child, please. You? Gay?

519
00:30:09,979 --> 00:30:11,820
I'm sick, George, not blind.

520
00:30:12,598 --> 00:30:14,073
They why have...

521
00:30:14,175 --> 00:30:19,204
Oh, because dying is a "get
out of jail free" card.

522
00:30:19,676 --> 00:30:23,863
I can be as bold as I want, and there's
nothing anybody can say about it.

523
00:30:24,057 --> 00:30:25,194
So I flirt.

524
00:30:26,854 --> 00:30:29,706
Haven't you ever been attracted to
someone you know you couldn't have?

525
00:30:30,744 --> 00:30:31,375
Well...

526
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:32,721
I'm...

527
00:30:34,277 --> 00:30:34,871
no.

528
00:30:35,655 --> 00:30:36,658
What's her name?

529
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:39,674
There's no...

530
00:30:40,754 --> 00:30:41,773
I'm not...

531
00:30:42,596 --> 00:30:43,404
you know...

532
00:30:44,246 --> 00:30:45,946
This is really...

533
00:30:46,529 --> 00:30:47,610
not...

534
00:30:51,578 --> 00:30:52,519
Meredith.

535
00:30:57,583 --> 00:30:58,771
Meredith.

536
00:31:01,711 --> 00:31:04,187
To be young and in love.

537
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,834
- Let's go get that liver, shall we?
- No, I'm sorry, I -

538
00:31:29,338 --> 00:31:30,956
I never liked harvesting.

539
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:32,457
Why?

540
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:36,388
Like I said, I'm a surgeon. I save lives.

541
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:37,965
This ends one.

542
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,339
I know you tried, so no hard feelings, okay?

543
00:31:49,752 --> 00:31:50,980
I was just...

544
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,194
You were saying goodbye.

545
00:32:11,425 --> 00:32:13,088
What's Viper doing here?

546
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:16,155
Probably crashed his bike - again.

547
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:17,994
How long has he been waiting?

548
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,713
I don't know.

549
00:32:20,115 --> 00:32:21,947
I've been busy on real cases.

550
00:32:22,248 --> 00:32:23,503
He's all yours.

551
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,910
Viper.

552
00:32:27,006 --> 00:32:27,773
Viper?

553
00:32:29,069 --> 00:32:30,036
Are you okay?!

554
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:34,153
Viper!

555
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:46,698
Call the O.R., Tell them we're coming,
and page Dr. Bailey. Alex, let's go.

556
00:32:47,102 --> 00:32:49,432
Alex, push the damn gurney!

557
00:32:50,267 --> 00:32:51,101
Clear the way.

558
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,667
Coming through.

559
00:32:53,087 --> 00:32:54,296
Somebody get the elevator.

560
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:57,204
Hurry. I don't know how long I
can keep this wound closed.

561
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,346
Move faster. Damn it!

562
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,007
This a new one?

563
00:33:12,072 --> 00:33:14,101
Somebody get her off my patient.

564
00:33:15,195 --> 00:33:18,585
Meredith, go get cleaned up,
and, Alex, get back downstairs.

565
00:33:18,672 --> 00:33:19,256
Yeah, but I helped.

566
00:33:19,327 --> 00:33:23,598
They tell me in the pit you only
want to take the hot cases.

567
00:33:23,659 --> 00:33:28,528
Every pack of interns, there's always one
fool running around trying to show off.

568
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,442
And, Alex, this time that fool is you. Get out.

569
00:33:34,853 --> 00:33:37,437
Somebody get me something to stand on.
Lower this table.

570
00:33:37,707 --> 00:33:39,577
The mountain is gonna have to come to me.

571
00:33:41,528 --> 00:33:43,576
Count backwards from 10 for me.

572
00:33:43,994 --> 00:33:45,051
Richard.

573
00:33:46,372 --> 00:33:47,686
You're a good friend.

574
00:33:48,328 --> 00:33:49,479
The best.

575
00:33:49,721 --> 00:33:52,706
Shut up and count backwards already, Mack.

576
00:33:53,819 --> 00:33:54,882
Ten...

577
00:33:56,428 --> 00:33:57,544
nine...

578
00:33:58,562 --> 00:33:59,894
eight...

579
00:34:01,634 --> 00:34:02,884
sevuhhh...

580
00:34:12,356 --> 00:34:13,509
I'm not gonna stay.

581
00:34:14,151 --> 00:34:16,067
It's your job. You have to.

582
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:18,444
You're better at this part than me.

583
00:34:19,586 --> 00:34:21,731
I don't want to watch him get taken apart.

584
00:34:23,258 --> 00:34:26,094
Look at the vultures - waiting to pick him clean.

585
00:34:28,852 --> 00:34:31,588
Every last one of them
represents someone somewhere

586
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:34,060
who's gonna live because of Kevin.

587
00:34:35,248 --> 00:34:36,795
Here. Put it on.

588
00:34:37,321 --> 00:34:38,950
I'll be waiting next door when you're ready.

589
00:34:39,058 --> 00:34:40,199
Everyone's waiting.

590
00:34:42,451 --> 00:34:45,345
Okay, doctors, let's get this over with.

591
00:37:03,874 --> 00:37:04,686
Izzie?

592
00:37:06,715 --> 00:37:09,152
I'm gonna sew him up - for his family.

593
00:37:34,798 --> 00:37:35,447
You do it.

594
00:37:36,147 --> 00:37:36,790
What?

595
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:37,584
You do it.

596
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:46,025
Mrs. Davidson.

597
00:37:47,274 --> 00:37:49,083
He's ready, if you'd like to see him.

598
00:38:18,155 --> 00:38:20,096
This lovely group's his friends.

599
00:38:20,207 --> 00:38:22,738
Uh, you all belong to - what's his name?

600
00:38:22,818 --> 00:38:24,391
- Viper.
- V-viper.

601
00:38:24,478 --> 00:38:25,729
Yeah, we were in the race.

602
00:38:25,794 --> 00:38:27,136
How is he? Is he okay?

603
00:38:27,897 --> 00:38:29,030
Is he okay?

604
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:32,733
No. No, he's not okay at all.

605
00:38:32,804 --> 00:38:37,257
He hurled his body down a concrete
mountain at full speed for no good reason.

606
00:38:37,812 --> 00:38:41,626
Yeah, I know you all pierce
yourselves and smoke up

607
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:44,758
and generally treat your bodies like
your grungy asses can't break down.

608
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:49,995
Hey, that's fine. You want to kill yourselves
flying down a concrete mountain, go to it -

609
00:38:50,032 --> 00:38:54,697
but there are other people walking, people
driving, people trying to live their lives,

610
00:38:54,757 --> 00:38:59,991
and one of them got his brains scrambled today
because one of you little sniveling snot rag -

611
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:03,210
- Dr. Bailey.
- Yeah, so. Okay, no.

612
00:39:03,293 --> 00:39:06,288
Your friend, Viper, as far as
I'm concerned, is not okay.

613
00:39:10,593 --> 00:39:14,291
She's, um... really tired.

614
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:19,002
- But... Viper's gonna make it.
- Cool.

615
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,164
He's gonna live.

616
00:39:20,655 --> 00:39:21,862
Thanks.

617
00:39:30,464 --> 00:39:31,836
It's not the chase.

618
00:39:32,622 --> 00:39:33,287
What?

619
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:34,792
You and me.

620
00:39:36,148 --> 00:39:37,922
It is not the thrill of the chase.

621
00:39:39,389 --> 00:39:40,260
It's not a game.

622
00:39:40,602 --> 00:39:41,311
It's...

623
00:39:43,284 --> 00:39:45,539
It's your tiny, ineffectual fists.

624
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:49,979
And your hair.

625
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:53,920
My hair?

626
00:39:54,265 --> 00:39:55,167
It smells good.

627
00:39:57,212 --> 00:39:58,585
And you're very, very bossy.

628
00:39:59,846 --> 00:40:00,835
Keeps me in line.

629
00:40:07,269 --> 00:40:09,216
I'm still not going out with you.

630
00:40:11,312 --> 00:40:12,620
You say that now.

631
00:40:29,204 --> 00:40:30,562
How'd it go?

632
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:32,882
Very smoothly.

633
00:40:34,022 --> 00:40:34,735
Damn.

634
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,284
That means I'm gonna have to quit smoking.

635
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:01,134
Ah, the pretty ones always come crawling back.

636
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:12,594
There's another way to survive this competition -

637
00:41:12,695 --> 00:41:15,071
a way no one ever seems to tell you about,

638
00:41:15,645 --> 00:41:17,749
one you have to learn for yourself.

639
00:41:18,485 --> 00:41:19,577
Number five -

640
00:41:21,113 --> 00:41:23,836
it's not about the race at all.

641
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:26,495
There are no winners or losers.

642
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,312
Victories are counted by
the number of lives saved.

643
00:41:46,357 --> 00:41:50,430
Oh, okay, this is the best part. Watch. She
pulls the flap of skin down over the face.

644
00:41:52,418 --> 00:41:53,312
We were -

645
00:41:53,447 --> 00:41:54,264
Hi.

646
00:41:54,624 --> 00:41:56,164
We were - we were just, uh...

647
00:41:56,887 --> 00:41:58,024
Christina made us.

648
00:42:02,447 --> 00:42:08,196
And once in a while, if you're smart,
the life you save could be your own.

649
00:42:08,427 --> 00:42:09,759
What are we watching?

650
00:42:10,051 --> 00:42:15,733
- Oooh. This is the one where my mother...
- Literally pulls this guy's face off.

651
00:42:15,764 --> 00:42:16,453
Yeah.

652
00:42:18,721 --> 00:42:20,169
Come on!

653
00:42:20,233 --> 00:42:21,518
Oh! Holy crap!
