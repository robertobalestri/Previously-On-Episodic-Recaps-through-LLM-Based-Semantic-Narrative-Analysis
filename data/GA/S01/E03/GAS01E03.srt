1
00:00:04,131 --> 00:00:07,783
We live out our lives on the surgical unit.

2
00:00:07,802 --> 00:00:11,132
Seven days a week, 14 hours a day.

3
00:00:12,858 --> 00:00:14,843
We're together more than we're apart.

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,495
George's room is bigger than mine.

5
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:25,621
After a while... I have more clothes.

6
00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:26,925
I should have the bigger room.

7
00:00:27,184 --> 00:00:29,370
...the ways of residency... I got here first.

8
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,091
It's Meredith's house.

9
00:00:30,111 --> 00:00:30,632
She should decide.

10
00:00:30,652 --> 00:00:32,076
...become the ways of life.

11
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,280
My room is like two inches bigger than yours.

12
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:34,822
Number one.

13
00:00:34,843 --> 00:00:35,744
You have a bigger closet.

14
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:38,130
So why is everything a competition?

15
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:39,993
Always keep score.

16
00:00:41,137 --> 00:00:44,643
Number two, do whatever you can to outsmart the other guy.

17
00:00:45,043 --> 00:00:47,106
Everywhere else is filled with Meredith's mom's boxes.

18
00:00:47,707 --> 00:00:50,591
Meredith, when is your mom coming back to town anyway?

19
00:00:50,753 --> 00:00:52,956
Because maybe we can put her boxes in storage.

20
00:00:53,036 --> 00:00:55,259
Or unpack a few things, make this place a little more homey.

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,442
Some throw pillows, lamps, a few paintings.

22
00:00:57,844 --> 00:00:59,265
Oh, paintings would be nice.

23
00:00:59,286 --> 00:00:59,866
Yeah.

24
00:00:59,887 --> 00:01:01,909
You have all this amazing stuff just packed away.

25
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,477
In the back hall, I found this box with like 100 tapes of your mother performing these amazing medical procedures.

26
00:01:06,496 --> 00:01:06,697
Really?

27
00:01:06,716 --> 00:01:07,558
We should watch them, Meredith.

28
00:01:07,578 --> 00:01:08,579
Do you want to watch?

29
00:01:14,516 --> 00:01:18,921
Meredith, you want some privacy?

30
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:21,986
Number three, don't make friends with the enemy.

31
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:28,834
Morning, Dr. Bailey.

32
00:01:28,873 --> 00:01:29,454
Shut up.

33
00:01:32,457 --> 00:01:36,462
You realize that I'm an attending and you're only a resident?

34
00:01:36,483 --> 00:01:37,444
You work for me, right?

35
00:01:37,504 --> 00:01:39,427
No, I've forgotten something.

36
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:41,168
Something is happening today.

37
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:44,052
I know I should know what it is, but I just can't.

38
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,069
All right, nice talking with you, Dr. Bailey.

39
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,453
It's right in front of my face.

40
00:01:52,316 --> 00:01:54,259
Oh, doctor!

41
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,903
Oh!

42
00:01:57,924 --> 00:01:58,245
Oh!

43
00:01:58,325 --> 00:01:59,787
Not enough.

44
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:06,798
Watch out, watch out.

45
00:02:06,817 --> 00:02:08,501
Who's on bikes killing themselves?

46
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:11,004
Natural selection is what it is.

47
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:12,105
So what's up with the Nazis?

48
00:02:12,145 --> 00:02:12,867
She offer meds?

49
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:14,409
You're not heard of the race?

50
00:02:16,347 --> 00:02:17,269
Excellent board.

51
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:19,854
Well-timed, balanced, efficient.

52
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,538
If all goes well, we'll have a early night.

53
00:02:21,557 --> 00:02:24,104
Chief, dead baby bike race started 20 minutes ago.

54
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,889
All right, people, dead baby bike race day.

55
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,134
Every year, this bar... The dead baby bar.

56
00:02:29,395 --> 00:02:32,061
Every year, they hold this underground bike race.

57
00:02:32,664 --> 00:02:35,409
Don't you wonder why someone would name a bar something so disgusting?

58
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,731
Keep your panties on, Nancy Drew.

59
00:02:37,373 --> 00:02:40,318
The race is completely illegal and crazy.

60
00:02:40,338 --> 00:02:45,086
There's a bunch of bike messengers racing against traffic trying to beat each other for free shots of tequila.

61
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:48,353
No holds barred competition sounds like fun.

62
00:02:48,372 --> 00:02:49,155
Yeah, you would think that.

63
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,699
The race doesn't even have any rules, except eye gouging.

64
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:52,580
No eye gouging.

65
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:56,566
We're able to be trapped in the pit, bandaging up idiots when we can be up in the O.R.?

66
00:02:56,586 --> 00:03:02,753
What kind of people engage in a race that has as its only rule that you can't rip out the eyeballs of another human being?

67
00:03:02,774 --> 00:03:03,816
Men, Georgie, men.

68
00:03:05,838 --> 00:03:07,240
I need someone to get up to the O.R.

69
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:07,461
floor.

70
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,762
The chief needs a right hand.

71
00:03:09,443 --> 00:03:11,485
Oh, and yeah, number four.

72
00:03:13,868 --> 00:03:14,169
George.

73
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,314
Everything, everything is a competition.

74
00:03:18,396 --> 00:03:20,419
OK, people, the rules of trauma.

75
00:03:20,438 --> 00:03:21,920
Don't mingle with the ER interns.

76
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:23,703
They don't know the ass from their esophagus.

77
00:03:24,143 --> 00:03:27,426
So fast, discharge fast to get bodies up to the OR yesterday.

78
00:03:27,486 --> 00:03:29,810
And don't let me catch you fighting over patients, got it?

79
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,375
Come on, let's go.

80
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:42,804
Oh, it's like candy, but with blood, which is so much better.

81
00:03:42,824 --> 00:03:43,324
Oh, my god.

82
00:03:43,343 --> 00:03:43,764
I'm fine.

83
00:03:43,784 --> 00:03:45,006
No, isolate me first.

84
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:47,508
Whoever said winning wasn't everything

85
00:03:49,126 --> 00:03:51,128
Ooh, I'll take that guy.

86
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:52,812
You'll have to beat me to it first.

87
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:53,953
Never held a scalpel.

88
00:04:01,044 --> 00:04:18,610
Nobody knows where they might end up Nobody knows Oh, oh, suppose

89
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:23,649
Heads is mine.

90
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,430
Tails is yours.

91
00:04:24,711 --> 00:04:25,694
Why do you get to be heads?

92
00:04:25,713 --> 00:04:26,815
Oh, because I have a head.

93
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,038
And honey, you are a tail.

94
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,180
Excuse me.

95
00:04:30,122 --> 00:04:31,685
How do you manage to make everything dirty?

96
00:04:34,892 --> 00:04:36,776
Tails, there are plenty of other cases.

97
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:37,778
So go get one.

98
00:04:37,838 --> 00:04:38,961
I was here first.

99
00:04:39,007 --> 00:04:42,353
I am not backing down so I can do sutures all day while you're up in the OR.

100
00:04:42,593 --> 00:04:44,476
This is a surgical case and you know it.

101
00:04:44,797 --> 00:04:45,697
It's superficial.

102
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,401
I mean, it's cool, but it's superficial.

103
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:49,704
How do you know those things didn't rupture his peritoneum?

104
00:04:49,964 --> 00:04:52,348
Because he's sitting up and he's sitting there talking to us.

105
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:53,410
Hello.

106
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,797
Excuse me, I was wondering if you could take these out and sign me up so I could go and win my race.

107
00:04:58,278 --> 00:04:59,800
Well, we can't just pull them out.

108
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:00,882
I mean, we have...

109
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:02,293
Do some tests.

110
00:05:02,312 --> 00:05:03,173
Oh, wicked.

111
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,956
Are you out of your mind?

112
00:05:05,857 --> 00:05:07,077
It's a superficial wound.

113
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,620
Sew him up and let him finish his race.

114
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,382
You... Uh, good man.

115
00:05:11,923 --> 00:05:16,427
Unidentified John Doe, mid-30s pedestrian, hit by a motorist swerving to avoid a bike.

116
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,309
GCS-3.

117
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:19,252
Pupils fixed and dilated.

118
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,274
Atropine given for a pulse in the 40s.

119
00:05:21,494 --> 00:05:22,896
BP 183 over 112.

120
00:05:23,235 --> 00:05:24,117
Pulse sucks 98%.

121
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:28,141
Cheshire widened mediastinum and head CT revealed cerebral edema.

122
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,425
He's gotten 70 of mannitol, dexamethasone 10, and a gram of phenytoin.

123
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:32,848
Going to the OR?

124
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,411
Is he corked?

125
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,033
Looks like.

126
00:05:36,055 --> 00:05:39,579
The bike race claims his first victim.

127
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,163
I'll make my AAA repair after all.

128
00:05:42,745 --> 00:05:44,728
Uh, Dr. Shepherd, he's not going to the OR?

129
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,331
No.

130
00:05:46,351 --> 00:05:48,636
Do an EEG and confirmatory tests.

131
00:05:48,935 --> 00:05:51,120
If he doesn't respond, six hours.

132
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,502
Declared.

133
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,334
Sir, Dr. Bailey sent me to assist you.

134
00:06:09,355 --> 00:06:10,016
Should I scrub in?

135
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:10,656
No.

136
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,298
I'm stuck here all day.

137
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:15,322
I need you on the floor monitoring my pre- and post-op patients.

138
00:06:16,303 --> 00:06:18,005
Oh.

139
00:06:18,026 --> 00:06:19,348
You got a problem with that, O'Malley?

140
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:20,649
Oh, uh, no, sir.

141
00:06:23,293 --> 00:06:26,317
Uh, a buddy of mine in 4451, Lloyd Mackey.

142
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:27,517
Give him whatever he needs.

143
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:48,630
Mr. Mackey, no smoking.

144
00:06:50,632 --> 00:06:51,494
There's no smoking.

145
00:06:51,593 --> 00:06:51,954
Why not?

146
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:53,576
Oh, my god.

147
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:54,757
You're in a hospital.

148
00:06:55,237 --> 00:06:55,939
Your point being?

149
00:06:58,182 --> 00:07:04,389
I don't know if you've listened to the surgeon general lately say in the past 20 years, but smoking is bad.

150
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:06,230
Smoking will kill you.

151
00:07:07,031 --> 00:07:09,434
Liver cancer will kill me.

152
00:07:09,454 --> 00:07:11,757
Smoking will just speed up the process.

153
00:07:13,077 --> 00:07:15,560
You're at the top of the donor list for a new liver.

154
00:07:16,485 --> 00:07:17,007
There's hope.

155
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:22,533
Sweetheart, I've been at the top of the list for eight months.

156
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:25,076
I'm not in a batter's cage.

157
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:28,901
I'm in the dugout about to be traded.

158
00:07:30,524 --> 00:07:31,324
You like baseball?

159
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:32,466
No.

160
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:35,089
Oh.

161
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,874
Well, the chief wanted me to look in on you.

162
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:41,497
Richard's a dear old friend.

163
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,142
He's been my doctor for 30 years.

164
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:48,305
Well, whatever you need, I'm your man.

165
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:49,807
Just name it.

166
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:54,334
Oh.

167
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:55,555
I'm sure I'll think of something.

168
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:04,810
Absent corneal reflexes.

169
00:08:06,593 --> 00:08:07,754
It's been 55 minutes.

170
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:14,576
If he doesn't respond to these tests in the next five hours, what, we're supposed to just stand here and watch him die?

171
00:08:14,596 --> 00:08:18,281
If he doesn't respond to these tests, it's because he's already dead.

172
00:08:19,843 --> 00:08:20,903
Technically, legally.

173
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:22,826
Actually, Izzy, actually dead.

174
00:08:23,187 --> 00:08:23,788
He's breathing.

175
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:24,749
He has a heartbeat.

176
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,771
Look at his EEG.

177
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,052
There's no higher brain function.

178
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:29,836
He'll never talk, move, or think again.

179
00:08:29,855 --> 00:08:31,358
There's no one in there.

180
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:33,220
Think like a doctor, Izzy.

181
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:34,461
He could wake up.

182
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:36,543
What about a miracle?

183
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:38,166
There are medical miracles, you know.

184
00:08:38,346 --> 00:08:38,687
I know.

185
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,039
You're right.

186
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,201
Miracles happen.

187
00:08:42,844 --> 00:08:43,605
People do wake up.

188
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:46,567
See, that's why we do a series of tests over a set number of hours.

189
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:52,416
So when we call time of death, we know that we've done everything in our power to make sure it's actually his time of death.

190
00:08:54,197 --> 00:08:55,318
There isn't gonna be any miracles.

191
00:09:00,546 --> 00:09:01,386
This is the hard part.

192
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:04,571
To stand around as surgeons and not cut.

193
00:09:05,772 --> 00:09:08,235
But that's what do no harm means.

194
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,865
I should just go into the light already so I can get on another case.

195
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,096
Oh, I'm the devil because I'd rather be in surgery instead of standing watch over the death squad?

196
00:09:23,116 --> 00:09:23,857
It's depressing.

197
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:30,908
Look at his sneakers.

198
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:32,892
They're brand new.

199
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,716
And somebody sewed this tear in his shirt.

200
00:09:36,037 --> 00:09:37,639
And he has one of those electronic key cards.

201
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:39,942
He belongs to someone.

202
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,652
An hour ago, he was out there alive.

203
00:09:43,432 --> 00:09:45,894
To simply stand here and wait for him to die.

204
00:09:45,914 --> 00:09:46,775
It would be a waste of life.

205
00:09:47,196 --> 00:09:47,677
Exactly.

206
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:49,457
It would be a waste of organs.

207
00:09:58,287 --> 00:10:01,429
You got a nice touch.

208
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,431
And by the way, you are a rocking babe.

209
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:06,494
Seriously, do you actually think you have a shot here?

210
00:10:06,634 --> 00:10:09,356
I like to think I've got a shot anywhere.

211
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,488
Look, you really have to let me take you for some tests.

212
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:13,408
Run a CT.

213
00:10:13,668 --> 00:10:15,010
You could have internal bleeding.

214
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:15,873
No, thank you.

215
00:10:15,893 --> 00:10:17,075
I've got a race to get back to.

216
00:10:18,056 --> 00:10:18,255
Why?

217
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:19,437
You can't win now anyway.

218
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,520
Doesn't mean I can't cross that finish line.

219
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:24,485
There's a party at the finish line.

220
00:10:24,504 --> 00:10:27,089
Do you want to meet me there?

221
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:28,370
One test, a CT.

222
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,653
I'll have you out of here in an hour.

223
00:10:29,732 --> 00:10:30,374
Can't do it.

224
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:34,419
Got to go.

225
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,466
OK, well, you realize you're leaving up against medical advice, and then I strongly urge you to stay.

226
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:40,076
The frat guy said I could go.

227
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:41,998
The frat guy is an ass.

228
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:43,900
Okay.

229
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,423
Well, you have to sign an AMA form.

230
00:10:47,725 --> 00:10:50,388
Ellen, I will do anything you want me to.

231
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,833
What is it with you guys and your need to dirty everything up?

232
00:10:55,854 --> 00:10:56,394
I don't know.

233
00:10:56,894 --> 00:10:58,376
Maybe it's the testosterone, hey?

234
00:10:59,378 --> 00:10:59,697
Maybe.

235
00:10:59,738 --> 00:11:03,001
You might want to see a doctor about that, too.

236
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,061
That was for good luck.

237
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:20,364
Don't worry, darling, you'll see me again.

238
00:11:22,888 --> 00:11:24,289
For your sake, I hope not.

239
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:39,552
What do you want?

240
00:11:39,913 --> 00:11:41,154
Do you make out with patients now?

241
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:43,719
What, are you jealous?

242
00:11:45,302 --> 00:11:46,302
I don't get jealous.

243
00:11:50,096 --> 00:11:51,379
We had sex once.

244
00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:53,081
And we kissed in an elevator.

245
00:11:54,725 --> 00:11:56,567
And we kissed in an elevator once.

246
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:57,570
No, seriously.

247
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,232
Come on, go out with me.

248
00:11:59,653 --> 00:11:59,874
No.

249
00:12:01,056 --> 00:12:02,017
You know, I almost died today.

250
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:04,020
Yeah, I came like this, Klaus.

251
00:12:05,082 --> 00:12:08,288
How would you feel if I died and you didn't get a chance to go out with me?

252
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:10,211
Get over yourself already.

253
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:11,192
Come on.

254
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,578
It's the chase, isn't it?

255
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,801
What?

256
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,432
The thrill of the chase.

257
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:22,058
I've been wondering to myself, why are you so hell-bent on getting me to go out with you?

258
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,441
You know you're my boss.

259
00:12:23,761 --> 00:12:24,783
You know it's against the rules.

260
00:12:25,264 --> 00:12:26,326
You know I keep saying no.

261
00:12:27,187 --> 00:12:27,727
It's the chase.

262
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,072
Well, it's fun, isn't it?

263
00:12:30,472 --> 00:12:30,812
You see?

264
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:33,697
This is a game to you, but not to me.

265
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:37,384
Because unlike you, I still have something to prove.

266
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,003
I know you see me resecting this bowel.

267
00:12:43,123 --> 00:12:45,547
Do I strike you as someone who enjoys multitasking?

268
00:12:45,788 --> 00:12:46,668
We have a John Doe.

269
00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:48,892
In three hours, we have to declare him brain dead.

270
00:12:49,432 --> 00:12:50,475
We want to harvest his organs.

271
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,277
Jill, why are you wasting time on this?

272
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:54,220
You know how many patients we have downstairs.

273
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,746
If he dies, and he could still live, you know, his death should mean something.

274
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:02,793
Then you want to harvest surgery.

275
00:13:03,094 --> 00:13:04,535
I want to save lives.

276
00:13:06,845 --> 00:13:08,125
OK, I want a harvest surgery.

277
00:13:08,426 --> 00:13:10,869
Getting organs from a John Doe is a long shot.

278
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:13,171
Without ID, you can't contact the family.

279
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:16,514
Without the family, you can't get consent to harvest the organs.

280
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:17,634
Let's poor man die in peace.

281
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:18,995
What if we can find the family?

282
00:13:19,176 --> 00:13:20,157
Then get consent.

283
00:13:20,397 --> 00:13:21,197
We could harvest the organs?

284
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:24,041
If you find the family.

285
00:13:26,982 --> 00:13:29,225
Cardiac refusion is 4217.

286
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:30,966
Cardiac refusion is 4217.

287
00:13:31,006 --> 00:13:31,648
What are you doing?

288
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,129
Hiding.

289
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:34,450
There's this VIP patient.

290
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:36,312
He likes me.

291
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:37,769
Let's go, right?

292
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:40,394
He likes me, likes me.

293
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,115
Go for it, man.

294
00:13:42,476 --> 00:13:43,118
Get yours.

295
00:13:43,238 --> 00:13:44,360
I'm down with the rainbow.

296
00:13:49,888 --> 00:13:51,350
Oh.

297
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:51,910
Are you not gay?

298
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:54,075
No.

299
00:13:54,095 --> 00:13:54,475
Really?

300
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,198
Dude, sorry.

301
00:13:59,342 --> 00:14:04,289
Uh, Christina?

302
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,490
Does Meredith think I'm gay?

303
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:11,831
Are you?

304
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,514
No.

305
00:14:14,274 --> 00:14:14,495
Really?

306
00:14:14,535 --> 00:14:21,746
Hey, we found the sign on John Doe.

307
00:14:21,767 --> 00:14:22,748
It's a hotel key card.

308
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:24,910
I've called the police, and they're going to send someone over.

309
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,754
Maybe they can figure out what hotel he was staying at, get his ID from there.

310
00:14:28,336 --> 00:14:29,738
Could you make sure the police get it?

311
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:30,418
OK.

312
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,841
It's just, it's really important.

313
00:14:31,922 --> 00:14:36,107
We only have a few hours before we have to declare him, and I'd really like to find his family.

314
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,951
Do you want their permission for organ donation?

315
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,774
I just really want to find him.

316
00:14:46,538 --> 00:14:47,480
You have a potential donor?

317
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:50,264
What's his blood type?

318
00:14:51,346 --> 00:15:03,789
Uh, oneg.

319
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:03,909
OK.

320
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:06,745
Well, I know you probably can't hear me.

321
00:15:07,765 --> 00:15:17,280
And you're feeling this big push to go towards the light where everything's all halos and all-you-can-eat buffets and stuff.

322
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:22,609
And I mean, sharing your organs is really great and all.

323
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:23,770
But I think you have a family.

324
00:15:25,653 --> 00:15:26,274
I can feel it.

325
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:32,985
So I think it'd be really great if you could do me a favor and get better.

326
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:39,173
Just live.

327
00:15:41,605 --> 00:15:43,092
So you think you could give that a shot for me?

328
00:16:08,908 --> 00:16:11,572
No.

329
00:16:11,592 --> 00:16:11,972
Meredith.

330
00:16:13,414 --> 00:16:13,716
Meredith.

331
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:14,196
What?

332
00:16:14,255 --> 00:16:14,876
He's crashing.

333
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:16,438
Well, what the hell are you doing?

334
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,039
Call a coach.

335
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:17,500
I can't.

336
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,282
I'm not supposed to.

337
00:16:18,322 --> 00:16:18,883
He's brain dead.

338
00:16:19,283 --> 00:16:21,285
Well, Izzy, if he's brain dead, you have to let him go.

339
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:21,687
No.

340
00:16:22,246 --> 00:16:23,708
It's only been five hours and 33 minutes.

341
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:25,030
He's supposed to get six hours.

342
00:16:25,471 --> 00:16:27,114
Well, we can't do anything to help him live.

343
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,635
It's not our place to make that call.

344
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:29,918
He's a person.

345
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:31,139
We're doctors.

346
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,582
We should have every right to make that call.

347
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:37,365
We can't just stand here and do nothing while he dies.

348
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:40,048
He has a right to the next 27 minutes.

349
00:16:44,774 --> 00:16:45,154
Screw it.

350
00:16:45,696 --> 00:16:46,496
I'll get the dopamine.

351
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:47,337
You get the blood.

352
00:16:47,918 --> 00:16:48,678
We'll transfuse him.

353
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:57,250
Do you feel any pain here?

354
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:58,610
No.

355
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,957
You know, you really do have beautiful eyelashes.

356
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,728
Um, thank you.

357
00:17:07,288 --> 00:17:07,930
Uh, what about here?

358
00:17:09,451 --> 00:17:09,672
No.

359
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:11,894
And nice eyes.

360
00:17:12,776 --> 00:17:13,155
Kind.

361
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:16,180
I like a man with kind eyes.

362
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:17,181
Really?

363
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:18,403
You think I have kind eyes?

364
00:17:19,183 --> 00:17:19,304
Mm-mm.

365
00:17:19,324 --> 00:17:26,993
I mean, uh, you can, uh... What are you examining me for?

366
00:17:27,273 --> 00:17:29,056
Oh, you know, just routine medical stuff.

367
00:17:30,198 --> 00:17:30,878
You're doing very well.

368
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,422
Because I'm enjoying the view.

369
00:17:44,724 --> 00:17:45,506
He's stable.

370
00:17:46,046 --> 00:17:46,487
For now.

371
00:17:46,507 --> 00:17:48,567
I had a radiologist look at his chest films.

372
00:17:48,587 --> 00:17:50,029
He has a traumatic aortic injury.

373
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,770
He's going to rupture and bleed out.

374
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,511
So he needs surgery.

375
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,773
If he's going to remain a viable organ donor, yeah.

376
00:17:54,794 --> 00:17:55,474
If he's going to live.

377
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:56,335
Is he?

378
00:17:56,435 --> 00:17:57,856
No, I'm not giving up on him.

379
00:17:57,936 --> 00:17:58,798
He has the surgery.

380
00:17:58,817 --> 00:17:59,397
He lives longer.

381
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:00,058
That's the point.

382
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:01,660
So I'm going to help find the family.

383
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,182
You guys find a way to get him into surgery.

384
00:18:04,061 --> 00:18:05,683
She's the vice president of Fantasyland.

385
00:18:06,144 --> 00:18:07,546
So who do we go to for the surgery?

386
00:18:07,605 --> 00:18:07,925
Bailey?

387
00:18:08,686 --> 00:18:09,748
We need to go higher than Bailey.

388
00:18:11,729 --> 00:18:12,230
Dr. Burke?

389
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:13,951
Hello.

390
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,731
OK.

391
00:18:18,509 --> 00:18:22,894
Um, I know you're busy, but our John Doe needs an aortic repair.

392
00:18:24,656 --> 00:18:25,478
The guy from this morning?

393
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:27,519
Isn't he legally dead?

394
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:29,823
Well, yeah.

395
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:30,825
He's kind of still around.

396
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,469
We gave him two units of PRBCs and put him on pressers.

397
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:35,651
On whose orders?

398
00:18:40,136 --> 00:18:40,517
Mine.

399
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:50,534
You get a brain-dead John Doe of blood transfusion without consulting anyone, and now you want me to repair his heart?

400
00:18:50,554 --> 00:18:51,395
Well, yes.

401
00:18:55,641 --> 00:18:57,743
You do enjoy crossing our line, don't you?

402
00:18:57,763 --> 00:19:00,968
He is an excellent candidate for organ donation.

403
00:19:00,988 --> 00:19:01,588
I am a surgeon.

404
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:02,529
I save lives.

405
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,071
This guy is already dead.

406
00:19:04,673 --> 00:19:06,234
Now, this is the men's room.

407
00:19:06,894 --> 00:19:08,917
Either whip one out or close the door.

408
00:19:13,488 --> 00:19:14,429
You're asking my advice?

409
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:15,089
Yes.

410
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,411
Now, who's chasing?

411
00:19:16,431 --> 00:19:16,951
Not funny.

412
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:17,913
This is important.

413
00:19:18,354 --> 00:19:19,795
OK.

414
00:19:19,815 --> 00:19:20,556
You want to get around Burke?

415
00:19:22,137 --> 00:19:27,523
You got to find a way to get the chief involved.

416
00:19:27,544 --> 00:19:27,983
What'd I do?

417
00:19:28,644 --> 00:19:31,228
How close a match for the liver is your guy to our John Doe?

418
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:32,068
Very.

419
00:19:32,128 --> 00:19:33,150
Same type, same size.

420
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,592
You knows couldn't find a better match.

421
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:34,872
Why?

422
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:37,075
He's the chief's VIP, right?

423
00:19:37,895 --> 00:19:38,195
Right.

424
00:19:38,934 --> 00:19:41,157
How much would you kill to be in on a transplant surgery?

425
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,260
You underestimate me.

426
00:19:44,902 --> 00:19:45,643
I'm not a baby.

427
00:19:46,403 --> 00:19:47,243
I'm your colleague.

428
00:19:48,266 --> 00:19:49,326
You don't have to manipulate me.

429
00:19:49,366 --> 00:19:51,809
If you want something, all you have to do is ask.

430
00:19:52,931 --> 00:19:56,674
We want you to go over Burke's head to the chief.

431
00:19:56,694 --> 00:19:57,756
Ask me something easier.

432
00:19:59,438 --> 00:19:59,597
Sir?

433
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,099
Oh, Mally.

434
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:01,820
How's Mackie?

435
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:02,161
Fine.

436
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:04,503
Sir, actually, that's what I want to talk to you about.

437
00:20:05,564 --> 00:20:10,932
I kind of think that me and the other interns, we think we're not.

438
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:12,233
Well, now I'm not getting any younger.

439
00:20:13,236 --> 00:20:14,317
We found Mackie a liver.

440
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,102
We are so going to hell.

441
00:20:17,442 --> 00:20:18,743
Burke is sending us straight to hell.

442
00:20:18,904 --> 00:20:19,905
On an express train.

443
00:20:20,346 --> 00:20:22,990
It works.

444
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:23,511
What are you doing?

445
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:32,005
Nothing.

446
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:33,968
Yes.

447
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:47,520
Dr. Burke!

448
00:20:47,941 --> 00:20:48,561
Dr. Burke!

449
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:51,925
Excellent work, sir.

450
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:54,587
Excellent.

451
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:55,009
Flawless.

452
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:56,891
It's a shame he's brain dead.

453
00:20:56,911 --> 00:20:59,472
If he wasn't, he would be on his feet in a few days.

454
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:02,997
I'm amazed at what skill your hands have.

455
00:21:03,017 --> 00:21:04,117
I seriously hate that guy.

456
00:21:04,739 --> 00:21:05,638
Alex's vermin.

457
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,441
That surgery is ours.

458
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:09,343
At least Burke is doing the surgery.

459
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:10,443
I don't care about Alex.

460
00:21:11,384 --> 00:21:13,067
George, you did good.

461
00:21:13,991 --> 00:21:16,636
I'm going to have to dodge Burke for the rest of my career.

462
00:21:16,656 --> 00:21:20,884
He could kill me and make it look like an accident.

463
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,554
The police call.

464
00:21:25,594 --> 00:21:27,817
They've identified your John Doe.

465
00:21:27,837 --> 00:21:31,865
His wife is on the way.

466
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:45,040
Oh, my god.

467
00:21:47,563 --> 00:21:48,044
Kevin.

468
00:21:48,084 --> 00:21:50,385
It's OK.

469
00:21:50,405 --> 00:21:51,406
Oh, my god.

470
00:21:51,446 --> 00:21:54,549
Mrs. Stevenson, this is Dr. Stevens.

471
00:21:57,231 --> 00:22:11,085
Now, if you have any questions at all, please, please call me.

472
00:22:11,346 --> 00:22:13,867
Is there still a chance?

473
00:22:17,054 --> 00:22:18,756
We can hold off till morning.

474
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:26,185
But if there's still no change, we'd like to talk to you about organ donation.

475
00:22:33,856 --> 00:22:39,525
Mackie.

476
00:22:39,545 --> 00:22:42,548
How are we treating you?

477
00:22:44,391 --> 00:22:44,951
Oh, fine.

478
00:22:47,227 --> 00:22:49,352
Except that beautiful boy won't let me smoke.

479
00:22:50,914 --> 00:22:52,057
You should reprimand him.

480
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:58,633
Make him change bedpans.

481
00:22:58,653 --> 00:23:02,501
Mackie, that beautiful boy may have found you a liver.

482
00:23:18,766 --> 00:23:22,750
God, I smell good.

483
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:34,141
You know what it is?

484
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:39,685
It's the smell of open-heart surgery.

485
00:23:39,705 --> 00:23:40,666
It's awesome.

486
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:42,127
It is awesome.

487
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:43,369
You gotta smell me.

488
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,751
I don't want to smell you.

489
00:23:46,152 --> 00:23:46,932
Oh, yes, you do.

490
00:23:47,285 --> 00:23:51,132
You are good to be kidding me.

491
00:23:51,152 --> 00:23:53,476
Okay, I have more important things to deal with than you.

492
00:23:53,816 --> 00:23:56,902
I have roommates and boy problems and family problems.

493
00:23:57,241 --> 00:24:00,007
You want to act like a little frat boy bitch, that's fine.

494
00:24:00,268 --> 00:24:03,854
You want to take credit for your saves and everybody else's, that's fine too.

495
00:24:04,114 --> 00:24:05,676
Just stay out of my face.

496
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:09,663
And for the record, you smell like crap.

497
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:18,769
She attacked me.

498
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:19,191
Meredith!

499
00:24:19,211 --> 00:24:19,490
Meredith!

500
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:19,830
Meredith!

501
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:20,152
Meredith!

502
00:24:23,234 --> 00:24:23,635
You know what?

503
00:24:23,655 --> 00:24:39,532
You might want to leave before I change my mind and let her beat you to a pulp with her tiny, ineffectual fists.

504
00:24:39,894 --> 00:24:40,473
What?

505
00:24:41,695 --> 00:24:42,016
Nothing.

506
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:45,759
It's just...

507
00:24:47,596 --> 00:24:52,740
Nothing.

508
00:25:01,931 --> 00:25:04,894
Oh, this one is skin grafting.

509
00:25:04,913 --> 00:25:05,693
Skin grafting?

510
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:06,134
No way.

511
00:25:06,734 --> 00:25:08,897
I've never seen that done before.

512
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:10,439
Are those my mother's surgical tapes?

513
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:12,320
Please watch the skin grafting one first.

514
00:25:13,734 --> 00:25:15,115
Where did all this stuff come from?

515
00:25:16,076 --> 00:25:17,618
Oh, I unpacked some of your mother's things.

516
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:18,740
I was upset.

517
00:25:19,181 --> 00:25:20,561
And when I'm upset, I like to nest.

518
00:25:23,045 --> 00:25:25,307
Oh, I have my palvectomy.

519
00:25:25,326 --> 00:25:26,468
I think we should watch this one first.

520
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:27,229
No.

521
00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:28,049
No.

522
00:25:29,191 --> 00:25:31,073
We're not watching my mother's surgery tapes.

523
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:32,654
We're not unpacking boxes.

524
00:25:32,714 --> 00:25:36,578
We're not having long conversations where we celebrate the moments of our lives.

525
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:38,780
And use a coaster.

526
00:25:40,853 --> 00:25:42,288
I ordered Chinese food.

527
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:44,535
I hate Chinese food!

528
00:25:50,692 --> 00:25:52,534
They're everywhere, all the time.

529
00:25:52,574 --> 00:25:56,538
Izzy's all perky, and George does this thing where he's helpful and considerate.

530
00:25:57,078 --> 00:26:00,982
They share food, and they say things, and they move things, and they breathe.

531
00:26:02,203 --> 00:26:03,005
They're, like, happy.

532
00:26:04,286 --> 00:26:04,906
Kick them out.

533
00:26:05,247 --> 00:26:06,228
I can't kick them out.

534
00:26:06,248 --> 00:26:07,189
They just moved in.

535
00:26:07,308 --> 00:26:08,711
I asked them to move in.

536
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,090
So what?

537
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:15,738
You're just going to repress everything in some deep, dark, twisted place until one day you snap and kill them?

538
00:26:15,758 --> 00:26:15,837
Yep.

539
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:17,880
This is why we are friends.

540
00:26:18,738 --> 00:26:21,801
Why is the Nazi making us stay in the pit two days in a row?

541
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:23,022
Leftovers.

542
00:26:23,042 --> 00:26:23,943
Leftovers.

543
00:26:23,963 --> 00:26:28,970
Got to get the cyclist who were too drunk or too stupid or too scared to get themselves to a hospital yesterday.

544
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,532
Well, meanwhile, she gets to do a freaking organ harvest.

545
00:26:31,553 --> 00:26:32,134
That kills me, doesn't it?

546
00:26:32,153 --> 00:26:32,374
What?

547
00:26:32,534 --> 00:26:33,935
That two women caught the harvest.

548
00:26:33,955 --> 00:26:36,077
No, it kills me that anybody got the harvest but me.

549
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:38,520
Boobs do not factor into this equation.

550
00:26:39,461 --> 00:26:40,123
Come on, son.

551
00:26:40,143 --> 00:26:45,148
You want to show me yours?

552
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:46,250
I'm going to become a lesbian.

553
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,090
Me too.

554
00:26:53,550 --> 00:27:00,076
Now, Mrs. Davidson, this form simply says you've consented the donation of your husband's major organs, heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys.

555
00:27:06,864 --> 00:27:08,345
Now I need to ask you a few questions.

556
00:27:08,925 --> 00:27:10,247
Are you willing to donate his corneas?

557
00:27:12,469 --> 00:27:13,329
But you want his eyes?

558
00:27:17,354 --> 00:27:20,757
Um, corneal transplants can give someone back their sight.

559
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:26,297
I suppose that's OK.

560
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:43,594
What about his skin?

561
00:27:45,655 --> 00:27:45,876
What?

562
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,240
It's used to help burn victims.

563
00:27:53,203 --> 00:27:55,266
You want to cut off his skin?

564
00:27:58,232 --> 00:27:59,256
What about the funeral?

565
00:28:01,442 --> 00:28:03,868
You want me to have a funeral and have people look at him?

566
00:28:05,634 --> 00:28:08,784
Have his daughter look at her father and he doesn't have any skin?

567
00:28:08,824 --> 00:28:11,652
It's his skin.

568
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:35,234
What are you doing?

569
00:28:36,016 --> 00:28:38,398
I'm not a people person.

570
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:39,779
No kidding.

571
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:40,320
I can't do that.

572
00:28:40,381 --> 00:28:41,721
I can't talk to the families of patients.

573
00:28:41,903 --> 00:28:42,103
I'm sorry.

574
00:28:44,346 --> 00:28:44,905
What's his name?

575
00:28:46,147 --> 00:28:46,567
Who?

576
00:28:46,587 --> 00:28:47,169
The patient.

577
00:28:47,388 --> 00:28:48,269
What's his name?

578
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:51,934
Kevin Davidson.

579
00:28:52,474 --> 00:28:53,115
Remember that.

580
00:28:53,435 --> 00:28:54,518
Not Gorkt Guy.

581
00:28:54,577 --> 00:28:55,538
Not John Doe.

582
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:56,779
Kevin Davidson.

583
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:57,721
He's someone's husband.

584
00:28:58,102 --> 00:28:58,782
Someone's son.

585
00:28:59,303 --> 00:29:01,405
Not a collection of body parts for you to harvest.

586
00:29:01,885 --> 00:29:02,547
A person.

587
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:04,971
No one said this was easy.

588
00:29:16,386 --> 00:29:27,301
I owe you, George.

589
00:29:27,342 --> 00:29:30,205
No, you don't owe me anything.

590
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:32,769
I'm just happy we found a liver.

591
00:29:35,196 --> 00:29:42,546
Well, when I get out of here, how about I take you and my new liver out for a night on the town?

592
00:29:42,566 --> 00:29:43,026
What do you say?

593
00:29:48,071 --> 00:29:51,175
Uh, Mr. Mackey, no offense or anything.

594
00:29:51,655 --> 00:30:03,549
You're very handsome, but I, um, I'm not, I mean, you're not my type, because you're a man, and... George, I never thought you were gay.

595
00:30:05,655 --> 00:30:06,076
You didn't?

596
00:30:06,277 --> 00:30:07,198
Oh, Charles, please.

597
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:07,598
You?

598
00:30:07,858 --> 00:30:08,140
Gay?

599
00:30:10,462 --> 00:30:11,825
I'm sick, George, not blind.

600
00:30:13,126 --> 00:30:15,611
Then why have you?

601
00:30:15,631 --> 00:30:19,076
Well, because dying is a get-out-of-jail-free card.

602
00:30:20,057 --> 00:30:23,742
I can be as bold as I want, and there's nothing anybody can say about it.

603
00:30:24,384 --> 00:30:25,045
So I flirt.

604
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:29,531
Haven't you ever been attracted to someone you know you couldn't have?

605
00:30:31,034 --> 00:30:33,417
Well, I'm...

606
00:30:34,461 --> 00:30:34,761
No.

607
00:30:35,963 --> 00:30:36,585
What's her name?

608
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:53,112
There's no... I'm not... You know, this is really not... Meredith.

609
00:31:07,351 --> 00:31:17,041
Let's go get that liver shot.

610
00:31:17,102 --> 00:31:17,662
No, I'm sorry.

611
00:31:17,682 --> 00:31:31,317
I didn't... I never liked harvesting.

612
00:31:31,938 --> 00:31:32,298
Why?

613
00:31:33,741 --> 00:31:35,305
Like I said, I'm a surgeon.

614
00:31:35,605 --> 00:31:36,307
I save lives.

615
00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:38,130
This ends well.

616
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,344
I know you tried, so no hard feelings, OK?

617
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:51,276
I was just.

618
00:31:51,336 --> 00:31:52,478
You were saying goodbye.

619
00:32:11,813 --> 00:32:12,815
What's Viper doing here?

620
00:32:13,497 --> 00:32:15,942
Probably crashed his bike again.

621
00:32:16,845 --> 00:32:17,887
How long has he been waiting?

622
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:19,551
Don't know.

623
00:32:20,374 --> 00:32:21,556
Busy on real cases.

624
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:23,320
He's all yours.

625
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:25,866
Viper.

626
00:32:27,329 --> 00:32:29,434
Viper?

627
00:32:29,474 --> 00:32:30,176
Are you OK?

628
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,202
Call up to the OR and tell them we're coming in.

629
00:32:44,242 --> 00:32:45,124
Page Dr. Bailey.

630
00:32:45,364 --> 00:32:45,704
Right away.

631
00:32:45,724 --> 00:32:46,405
Alex, let's go.

632
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:49,170
Alex, push the damn gurney.

633
00:32:50,491 --> 00:32:50,952
Clear the way.

634
00:32:50,992 --> 00:32:53,356
Coming through.

635
00:32:53,376 --> 00:32:54,337
Somebody get the elevator.

636
00:32:54,498 --> 00:32:54,838
Hurry.

637
00:32:54,979 --> 00:32:57,041
I don't know how long I can keep this room closed.

638
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,451
Move faster.

639
00:33:03,593 --> 00:33:04,534
Damn it.

640
00:33:11,196 --> 00:33:11,998
This is a new one.

641
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,760
Somebody get her off my patient.

642
00:33:15,623 --> 00:33:17,405
Meredith, go get cleaned up from scrubbing.

643
00:33:17,486 --> 00:33:18,688
Alex, get back downstairs.

644
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:19,307
Yeah, but I help.

645
00:33:19,388 --> 00:33:20,109
Help?

646
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,413
Yeah, they tell me down in the pit you only want to take the hot kicks.

647
00:33:23,894 --> 00:33:28,761
Every pack of interns, there's always one fool running around trying to show off.

648
00:33:28,781 --> 00:33:30,744
And Alex, this time that fool is you.

649
00:33:30,765 --> 00:33:31,144
Get out.

650
00:33:33,729 --> 00:33:36,413
You better give me something to stand on.

651
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:37,134
Lower this table.

652
00:33:38,174 --> 00:33:39,616
Mountain's going to have to come to me.

653
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,372
Count backwards from 10 for me.

654
00:33:46,215 --> 00:33:47,356
You're a good friend.

655
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:49,200
The best.

656
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,766
Shut up and count backwards already, Mac.

657
00:33:54,205 --> 00:33:57,150
Nine.

658
00:34:02,276 --> 00:34:03,617
Nine.

659
00:34:03,637 --> 00:34:07,123
Nine.

660
00:34:07,143 --> 00:34:11,068
Nine.

661
00:34:11,088 --> 00:34:11,188
Nine.

662
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:11,307
Nine.

663
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:13,391
I'm not going to stay.

664
00:34:14,713 --> 00:34:15,333
It's your job.

665
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:15,893
You have to.

666
00:34:16,994 --> 00:34:19,918
You're better at this part than me.

667
00:34:19,938 --> 00:34:21,380
I don't want to watch him get taken apart.

668
00:34:23,501 --> 00:34:25,744
Look at the vultures waiting to pick him clean.

669
00:34:29,128 --> 00:34:33,612
Every last one of them represents someone somewhere who's going to live because of Kevin.

670
00:34:35,494 --> 00:34:36,534
Here, put it on.

671
00:34:37,096 --> 00:34:37,436
All right.

672
00:34:37,456 --> 00:34:39,398
I'll be waiting next door when you're ready.

673
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:40,518
Everyone's waiting.

674
00:34:42,710 --> 00:35:08,094
Okay, doctors, let's get this over with.

675
00:35:08,114 --> 00:35:08,414
You are my joy.

676
00:35:08,434 --> 00:35:08,735
You are my joy.

677
00:35:08,755 --> 00:35:09,054
You are my joy.

678
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:09,376
You are my joy.

679
00:35:09,396 --> 00:35:09,695
You are my joy.

680
00:35:33,266 --> 00:35:52,034
So don't be scared of all the hurtful words.

681
00:35:52,054 --> 00:35:53,115
Because in the end they'll hurt themselves much more.

682
00:35:53,135 --> 00:35:53,436
You are my joy.

683
00:35:53,456 --> 00:35:53,757
You are my joy.

684
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:54,077
You are my joy.

685
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:08,731
Izzy, I'm going to sew him up for his family.

686
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:36,376
You do it.

687
00:37:36,396 --> 00:37:36,657
What?

688
00:37:37,197 --> 00:37:37,579
You do it.

689
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:45,902
Mrs. Davidson?

690
00:37:47,527 --> 00:37:48,809
He's ready if you'd like to see him.

691
00:38:18,253 --> 00:38:19,896
This lovely group's his friends.

692
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,661
Uh, you all belong to, what was his name?

693
00:38:23,222 --> 00:38:23,623
Viper.

694
00:38:24,043 --> 00:38:24,545
Viper.

695
00:38:24,565 --> 00:38:26,188
Yeah, we were in the race.

696
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:26,568
How is he?

697
00:38:26,588 --> 00:38:27,090
Is he OK?

698
00:38:28,112 --> 00:38:28,211
Yeah.

699
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:29,735
Is he OK?

700
00:38:29,755 --> 00:38:29,974
No.

701
00:38:30,596 --> 00:38:32,920
No, he's not OK at all.

702
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:37,208
He hurled his body down a concrete mountain at full speed for no good reason.

703
00:38:38,351 --> 00:38:44,800
Hey, yeah, yeah, I know you all pierce yourselves and smoke up and generally treat your bodies like your grungy asses can't break down.

704
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:46,001
Hey, that's fine.

705
00:38:46,021 --> 00:38:49,065
You want to kill yourselves flying down a concrete mountain?

706
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:49,947
Go to it.

707
00:38:50,188 --> 00:39:00,161
But there are other people walking, people driving, people trying to live their lives on that concrete mountain, and one of them got his brain scrambled today because one of you little sniveling no-good snot rag.

708
00:39:00,181 --> 00:39:00,782
Dr. Bailey.

709
00:39:01,501 --> 00:39:03,085
Yeah, so, OK, no.

710
00:39:03,465 --> 00:39:06,469
Your friend Viper, as far as I'm concerned, is not OK.

711
00:39:10,786 --> 00:39:13,809
She's, um, really tired.

712
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:18,052
But Viper's gonna make it.

713
00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:19,835
He's gonna live.

714
00:39:20,835 --> 00:39:29,704
Thanks.

715
00:39:30,985 --> 00:39:31,706
It's not the chase.

716
00:39:32,907 --> 00:39:33,166
What?

717
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:34,849
You and me.

718
00:39:36,389 --> 00:39:37,992
It is not the thrill of the chase.

719
00:39:39,507 --> 00:39:43,251
It's not a game.

720
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:46,235
It's... It's your tiny, ineffectual fists.

721
00:39:46,255 --> 00:39:49,940
And your hair.

722
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:53,907
My hair?

723
00:39:54,467 --> 00:39:56,710
It smells good.

724
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,735
And you're very, very bossy.

725
00:39:59,755 --> 00:40:00,795
It keeps me in line.

726
00:40:07,644 --> 00:40:08,907
I'm still not going out with you.

727
00:40:11,552 --> 00:40:18,523
Can you say that now?

728
00:40:21,867 --> 00:40:30,259
How'd it go?

729
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,822
Very smoothly.

730
00:40:33,523 --> 00:40:34,244
Damn.

731
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:38,590
That means I have to quit smoking?

732
00:40:53,588 --> 00:41:09,731
Ah, the pretty ones always come falling back.

733
00:41:09,751 --> 00:41:12,356
There's another way to survive this competition.

734
00:41:12,956 --> 00:41:14,860
A way no one ever seems to tell you about.

735
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,503
One you have to learn for yourself.

736
00:41:18,364 --> 00:41:19,646
Number five.

737
00:41:21,246 --> 00:41:23,831
It's not about the race at all.

738
00:41:24,431 --> 00:41:26,333
There are no winners or losers.

739
00:41:27,835 --> 00:41:36,887
Victories are counted by the number of lives saved.

740
00:41:36,907 --> 00:41:44,778
Oh, OK.

741
00:41:44,798 --> 00:41:46,961
This is the best part.

742
00:41:46,981 --> 00:41:47,242
Watch.

743
00:41:47,282 --> 00:41:50,746
She pulls a black spinning down over her face.

744
00:41:52,481 --> 00:41:53,862
We were... Hi.

745
00:41:54,764 --> 00:41:58,007
We were just, uh... Christina made us.

746
00:42:02,692 --> 00:42:08,016
And once in a while, if you're smart, a life you save could be your own.

747
00:42:08,657 --> 00:42:09,759
What are we watching?

748
00:42:10,539 --> 00:42:11,480
Ooh.

749
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:16,085
This is the one where my mother... Literally pulls this guy's face off.

750
00:42:16,105 --> 00:42:18,847
Yeah.

751
00:42:18,867 --> 00:42:20,268
Go, Barb!

752
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:21,309
Go, Barb!

753
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:21,510
Go, Barb!
