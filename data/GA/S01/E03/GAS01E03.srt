1
00:00:04,034 --> 00:00:06,744
We live out our lives on the surgical unit.

2
00:00:08,034 --> 00:00:09,171
7 days a week,

3
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:11,168
14 hours a day.

4
00:00:12,632 --> 00:00:14,746
We're together more than we're apart.

5
00:00:16,356 --> 00:00:18,187
George's room is bigger than mine.

6
00:00:23,797 --> 00:00:24,730
After a while...

7
00:00:24,802 --> 00:00:27,071
I have more clothes -- I should have the bigger room.

8
00:00:27,147 --> 00:00:28,391
...the ways of residency...

9
00:00:28,473 --> 00:00:30,735
- I got here first.
- Meredith should decide.

10
00:00:30,828 --> 00:00:32,201
...become the ways of life.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,277
My room is like two inches bigger than yours.

12
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:35,925
- Number one... 
- You have a bigger closet.

13
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:39,996
- Why is everything a competition?
- Always keep score.

14
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:44,854
Number two -- do whatever you can to outsmart the other guy.

15
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:47,433
Everywhere else is filled with Meredith's mom's boxes.

16
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,612
Meredith? When is your mom coming back to town, anyway?

17
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:52,927
Because maybe we can put her boxes in storage.

18
00:00:52,998 --> 00:00:55,221
Or unpack a few things -- make this place more homey.

19
00:00:55,281 --> 00:00:57,538
Some throw pillows, some lamps, a few paintings.

20
00:00:57,628 --> 00:00:59,275
Oh, paintings would be nice.

21
00:00:59,347 --> 00:01:01,953
Yeah. You have all this amazing stuff packed away.

22
00:01:02,032 --> 00:01:06,316
I found this box with tapes of your mother performing amazing medical procedures.

23
00:01:06,387 --> 00:01:08,424
Really? We should watch them. Do you want to watch --

24
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:16,084
Meredith, do you want some privacy?

25
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,274
Number three -- don't make friends with the enemy.

26
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:29,734
- Morning, Dr. Bailey.
- Shut up.

27
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:37,308
You realize that I'm an attending and you're only a resident -- that you work for me, right?

28
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:41,102
I know I've forgotten something. Something is happening today.

29
00:01:41,163 --> 00:01:43,901
I know I should know what it is, but I just can't...

30
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,002
All right. Nice talking with you, Dr. Bailey.

31
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,763
It's right in front of my face.

32
00:02:06,707 --> 00:02:10,553
Fools on bikes, killing themselves -- natural selection is what it is.

33
00:02:10,802 --> 00:02:13,086
So what's up with the nazi? Is she off her meds?

34
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,520
You never heard of the race?

35
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:19,613
Excellent board -- well-timed, balanced, efficient.

36
00:02:19,718 --> 00:02:21,531
If all goes well, we'll have an early night.

37
00:02:21,602 --> 00:02:24,371
Chief, "dead baby" bike race started 20 minutes ago.

38
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:27,093
All right, people! Dead baby bike-race day!

39
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:29,143
- Every year, this bar -- 
- The dead baby bar.

40
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:32,014
Every year, they hold this underground bike race.

41
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:35,221
Don't you wonder why someone would name a bar something so disgusting?

42
00:02:35,277 --> 00:02:37,033
Keep your panties on, nancy drew.

43
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:40,664
- The race is completely illegal and -- 
- Crazy.

44
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:45,092
Bike messengers racing against traffic, trying to beat each other for free shots of tequila.

45
00:02:45,172 --> 00:02:48,235
All-out, no-holds-barred competition sounds like fun.

46
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:52,729
The race doesn't even have any rules -- except eye-gouging -- no eye-gouging.

47
00:02:52,823 --> 00:02:56,489
We're gonna be trapped in the pit band-aiding idiots when we could be up in the O.R.

48
00:02:56,556 --> 00:02:59,954
What kind of people engage in a race that has, as its only rule,

49
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:02,700
that you can't rip out the eyeballs of another human being?

50
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:04,107
Men, Georgie. Men.

51
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:09,037
I need someone to get up to the O.R. Floor. The chief needs a right hand.

52
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:11,772
Oh, and yeah, number four...

53
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:14,469
George.

54
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:18,265
...Everything. Everything is a competition.

55
00:03:18,351 --> 00:03:21,839
Okay, people. The rules of trauma -- don't mingle with E.R. Interns --

56
00:03:21,898 --> 00:03:23,829
they don't know their ass from their esophagus.

57
00:03:23,918 --> 00:03:27,043
Sew fast, discharge faster. Get bodies up to the O.R.

58
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:30,155
And don't let me catch you fighting over patients. Got it?

59
00:03:30,823 --> 00:03:31,739
Come on. Let's go.

60
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:42,333
Oh, it's like candy, but with blood, which is so much better!

61
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:43,128
Oh, my god.

62
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,092
- Mine.
- No! I saw him first!

63
00:03:45,523 --> 00:03:47,588
Whoever said winning wasn't everything...

64
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:52,645
- Ooh. I'll take that guy.
- You'll have to beat me to him first.

65
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:54,217
...never held a scalpel.

66
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:24,431
Heads -- he's mine. Tails -- he's yours.

67
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:25,762
Why do you get to be "heads"?

68
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:28,158
Because I have a head, and, honey, you are a tail.

69
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:29,366
Excuse me.

70
00:04:29,908 --> 00:04:31,844
How do you manage to make everything dirty?

71
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,280
Ha! Tails.

72
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:36,755
There are plenty of other cases.

73
00:04:36,836 --> 00:04:38,730
So go get one. I was here first.

74
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:42,284
I am not backing down so I can do sutures all day, while you're in the O.R.

75
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:44,439
This is a surgical case, and you know it.

76
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:45,596
It's superficial.

77
00:04:45,662 --> 00:04:47,461
It's cool, but it's superficial.

78
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,784
How do you know those things didn't rupture his peritoneum?

79
00:04:49,862 --> 00:04:52,441
Because he's sitting up, and he's talking to us.

80
00:04:52,857 --> 00:04:53,640
Hello.

81
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:58,172
Excuse me. I was wondering if you could take these out and sew me up so I could go and win my race.

82
00:04:58,254 --> 00:04:59,650
Well, we can't just pull them out --

83
00:04:59,722 --> 00:05:03,512
- We have to... do some tests.
- Ow, wicked.

84
00:05:03,562 --> 00:05:04,916
Are you out of your mind?

85
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:07,203
It's a superficial wound.

86
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,794
Sew him up and let him finish his race.

87
00:05:10,082 --> 00:05:11,570
Hey, good man.

88
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:16,102
Unidentified John Doe, mid-30s pedestrian, hit by a motorist swerving to avoid a bike.

89
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:17,531
G.C.S. 3.

90
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:19,235
Pupils fixed and dilated.

91
00:05:19,312 --> 00:05:21,311
Atropine given for a pulse in the 40s.

92
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:22,901
B.P. 183 over 112.

93
00:05:23,046 --> 00:05:24,377
Pulse-ox 98%.

94
00:05:24,453 --> 00:05:28,203
Chest showed widened mediastinum and head C.T. revealed cerebral edema.

95
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,662
He's gotten 70 of mannitol, dexamethasone 10, and a gram of phenytoin.

96
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,050
Get him to the O.R.?

97
00:05:33,694 --> 00:05:35,374
- Is he gorked?
- Looks like.

98
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,903
The bike race claims its first victim.

99
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,396
I'll make my triple-a repair after all.

100
00:05:42,363 --> 00:05:44,969
Uh, Dr. Shepherd? He's not going to the O.R.?

101
00:05:45,236 --> 00:05:48,747
No. Do an E.E.G. and confirmatory tests.

102
00:05:48,809 --> 00:05:52,592
If he doesn't respond in six hours, declare him.

103
00:05:54,843 --> 00:05:55,918
"Declare  him"?

104
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:57,149
Declare him what?

105
00:05:57,242 --> 00:05:58,066
B rain-dead.

106
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:10,186
Sir, Dr. Bailey sent me to assist you. Should I scrub in?

107
00:06:10,257 --> 00:06:12,360
No.  I'm stuck here all day.

108
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:15,413
I need you on the floor, monitoring my pre- and post-op patients.

109
00:06:15,972 --> 00:06:16,632
Oh.

110
00:06:17,758 --> 00:06:19,171
You got a problem with that, O'malley?

111
00:06:19,268 --> 00:06:20,871
Oh, uh, no, sir.

112
00:06:22,513 --> 00:06:27,440
A buddy of mine in 4451, Lloyd Mackie -- give him whatever he needs.

113
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:30,480
Yes, sir.

114
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:46,794
Mr. Mackie...

115
00:06:47,684 --> 00:06:48,765
no smoking!

116
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:52,221
- There's no smoking.
- Why not?

117
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,842
Oh, my god -- you're in a hospital!

118
00:06:55,072 --> 00:06:56,147
Your point being...?

119
00:06:57,902 --> 00:07:01,334
I don't know if you've listened to the surgeon general lately --

120
00:07:01,411 --> 00:07:04,622
say, in the past 20 years -- but smoking is bad.

121
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:06,408
Smoking will kill you.

122
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:08,677
Liver cancer will kill me.

123
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:11,937
Smoking will just speed up the process.

124
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:15,713
You're at the top of the donor list for a new liver.

125
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,236
There's hope.

126
00:07:18,241 --> 00:07:20,228
Sweetheart, I've been at the top of the list for...

127
00:07:21,512 --> 00:07:22,741
eight months.

128
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:25,368
I'm not in a batters cage.

129
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:29,413
I'm in a dugout, about to be traded.

130
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:31,610
You like baseball?

131
00:07:31,704 --> 00:07:32,705
No.

132
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,158
Um, well, um, the chief wanted me to look in on you.

133
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:41,721
Richard's a dear old friend.

134
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,085
He's been my doctor for 30 years.

135
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:48,474
Well, whatever you need -- I'm your man.

136
00:07:48,996 --> 00:07:49,976
Just name it.

137
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:51,541
Well...

138
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:55,752
I'm sure I'll think of something.

139
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:00,825
There's no corneal reflexes.

140
00:08:02,223 --> 00:08:03,594
It's been 55 minutes.

141
00:08:04,972 --> 00:08:07,604
If he doesn't respond to these tests in the next 5 hours, what?

142
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:10,589
We're supposed to just stand here and watch him die?

143
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:14,480
If he doesn't respond to these tests, it's because he's already dead.

144
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,687
Technically. Legally.

145
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:18,765
Actually, Izzie. Actually dead.

146
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:20,656
He's breathing. He has a heartbeat.

147
00:08:20,726 --> 00:08:22,978
Look at his E.E.G. -- There's no higher-brain function.

148
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,908
He'll never talk, move, or think again.

149
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:27,372
There's no one in there.

150
00:08:27,782 --> 00:08:29,194
Think like a doctor, Izzie.

151
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:30,536
He could wake up.

152
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:32,380
What about a miracle?

153
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:33,920
There are medical miracles, you know.

154
00:08:33,998 --> 00:08:36,133
I know. You're right.

155
00:08:36,234 --> 00:08:37,285
Miracles happen.

156
00:08:38,405 --> 00:08:42,650
People do wake up. That's why we do a series of tests over a set number of hours.

157
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,668
So when we call "time of death," we know that we've done everything

158
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:48,482
to make sure it's actually his time of death.

159
00:08:49,422 --> 00:08:51,385
That there's isn't going to be any miracles.

160
00:08:56,238 --> 00:08:57,432
This is the hard part --

161
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,703
to stand around as surgeons and not cut.

162
00:09:01,385 --> 00:09:04,242
That's what "do no harm" means.

163
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:10,995
I wish he'd just go into the light so I can get on another case.

164
00:09:14,282 --> 00:09:16,587
Oh, I'm the devil because I'd rather be in surgery

165
00:09:16,627 --> 00:09:18,818
instead of standing watch over the death squad?

166
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:19,960
It's depressing.

167
00:09:25,507 --> 00:09:26,729
Look at his sneakers.

168
00:09:27,677 --> 00:09:28,895
They're brand-new.

169
00:09:29,264 --> 00:09:31,644
And somebody sewed this tear in his shirt.

170
00:09:31,722 --> 00:09:33,667
And he has one of those electronic key cards.

171
00:09:34,016 --> 00:09:35,680
He belongs to someone.

172
00:09:36,351 --> 00:09:38,822
An hour ago, he was out there, alive.

173
00:09:39,018 --> 00:09:41,649
To simply stand here and wait for him to die --

174
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,605
- It would be a waste of life.
- Exactly.

175
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,475
A waste of organs.

176
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,238
You've got a nice touch.

177
00:09:56,869 --> 00:09:59,210
And, by the way, you are a rockin' babe.

178
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,272
Seriously -- do you actually think you have a shot here?

179
00:10:02,344 --> 00:10:04,034
I'd like to think I've got a shot anywhere.

180
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,882
Look, you have really have to let me take you for some tests. A C.T.

181
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,874
You could have internal bleeding.

182
00:10:10,962 --> 00:10:13,250
No, thank you. I've got a race to get back to.

183
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:15,441
Why? You can't win now, anyway.

184
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:17,566
Doesn't mean I can't cross that finish line.

185
00:10:17,946 --> 00:10:19,614
There's a party at the finish line.

186
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,390
Do you want to meet me there?

187
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:25,405
One test. A C.T. I'll have you out of here in an hour.

188
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:26,968
I can't do it. Got to go.

189
00:10:29,855 --> 00:10:34,381
Okay. Well, you realize you're leaving against medical advice and that I urge you to stay.

190
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,163
The frat guy said I could go.

191
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:38,053
The "frat guy" is an ass.

192
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:42,419
Okay, well, you have to sign an A.M.A. form.

193
00:10:43,248 --> 00:10:46,566
Darling, I will do anything you want me to.

194
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:51,359
What is it with you guys and your need to dirty everything up?

195
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:52,378
I don't know.

196
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,441
Maybe it's just testosterone.

197
00:10:54,805 --> 00:10:55,813
Maybe.

198
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,671
You might want to see a doctor about that, too.

199
00:10:59,735 --> 00:11:00,576
Come here.

200
00:11:12,996 --> 00:11:14,123
That was for good luck.

201
00:11:14,886 --> 00:11:16,365
Don't worry, darling, you'll see me again.

202
00:11:18,526 --> 00:11:20,636
For your sake, I hope not.

203
00:11:34,455 --> 00:11:35,524
What do you want?

204
00:11:35,597 --> 00:11:37,182
You make out with patients now?

205
00:11:38,483 --> 00:11:39,779
What, are you jealous?

206
00:11:40,812 --> 00:11:41,986
I don't get jealous.

207
00:11:45,728 --> 00:11:47,197
We had sex -- once.

208
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:49,097
And we kissed in an elevator.

209
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:52,466
And we kissed in an elevator -- once.

210
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:53,602
No, seriously.

211
00:11:53,824 --> 00:11:55,123
Go out with me.

212
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:55,917
No.

213
00:11:56,659 --> 00:11:57,945
You know, I almost died today.

214
00:11:58,517 --> 00:11:59,921
Yeah, I came like this close.

215
00:12:00,593 --> 00:12:04,391
How would you feel if I died and you didn't get a chance to go out with me?

216
00:12:04,704 --> 00:12:06,951
- Get over yourself, already.
- Come on.

217
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,551
It's the chase, isn't it?

218
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,708
What?

219
00:12:12,051 --> 00:12:13,459
The thrill of the chase.

220
00:12:13,674 --> 00:12:15,272
I've been wondering to myself,

221
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:18,184
"why are you so hell-bent on getting me to go out with you?"

222
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,770
You know you're my boss, you know it's against the rules,

223
00:12:20,842 --> 00:12:24,006
you know I keep saying no -- it's the chase.

224
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:26,085
Well, it's fun, isn't it?

225
00:12:26,172 --> 00:12:27,068
You see?

226
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,455
This is a game to you.

227
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:29,776
But not to me.

228
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:33,365
Because, unlike you, I still have something to prove.

229
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,808
I know you see me resecting this bowel.

230
00:12:38,882 --> 00:12:41,414
Do I strike you as someone who enjoys multitasking?

231
00:12:41,496 --> 00:12:44,814
We have a John Doe. In three hours, we have to declare him brain-dead.

232
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,421
We want to harvest his organs.

233
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:47,912
Why are you wasting time on this?

234
00:12:47,974 --> 00:12:49,908
You  know how many patients we have downstairs.

235
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:52,929
If he dies -- and he could still live --

236
00:12:53,108 --> 00:12:54,854
his death should mean something.

237
00:12:56,723 --> 00:12:58,535
And you want a harvest surgery.

238
00:12:58,643 --> 00:13:00,047
I want to save lives.

239
00:13:02,468 --> 00:13:04,060
Okay, I want a harvest surgery.

240
00:13:04,142 --> 00:13:06,569
Getting organs from a John Doe is a long shot.

241
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:08,786
Without I.D., you can't contact the family.

242
00:13:08,868 --> 00:13:11,825
Without the family, you can't get consent to harvest the organs.

243
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:13,521
Let the poor man die in peace.

244
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:14,710
What if we can find the family?

245
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,033
And get consent.

246
00:13:16,102 --> 00:13:17,407
We could harvest the organs?

247
00:13:18,349 --> 00:13:20,168
If you find the family.

248
00:13:25,643 --> 00:13:26,543
What are you doing?

249
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,053
Hiding.

250
00:13:28,723 --> 00:13:30,428
There's this V.I.P. patient --

251
00:13:30,863 --> 00:13:32,051
he likes me.

252
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,680
That's good, right?

253
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,521
He likes me likes me.

254
00:13:36,823 --> 00:13:38,855
Go for it, man. Get yours.

255
00:13:38,938 --> 00:13:40,350
I'm down with the rainbow.

256
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,867
Oh. Are you not gay?

257
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:48,988
No.

258
00:13:49,515 --> 00:13:50,376
Really?

259
00:13:51,891 --> 00:13:52,993
Dude, sorry.

260
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:00,196
Uh, Cristina?

261
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,446
Do you -- do you think --

262
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,536
Does Meredith think I'm gay?

263
00:14:07,154 --> 00:14:08,010
Are you?

264
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:09,638
No.

265
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:10,769
Really?

266
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:18,721
Hey, I found this on our John Doe. It's a hotel key card.

267
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:23,857
The police are going to send someone over, figure out what hotel he was staying at -- get his I.D.

268
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:25,715
- Could you -- 
- I'll make sure the police get it.

269
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:27,521
Okay. It's really important.

270
00:14:27,603 --> 00:14:32,124
We only have a few hours before we have to declare him, and I'd really like to find his family.

271
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:34,794
You want their permission for organ donation?

272
00:14:37,097 --> 00:14:39,442
I just... really want to find them.

273
00:14:42,237 --> 00:14:43,364
You have a potential donor?

274
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:46,160
What's his blood type?

275
00:14:46,497 --> 00:14:47,609
Uh, O-neg.

276
00:14:58,893 --> 00:14:59,820
Okay.

277
00:15:00,696 --> 00:15:03,014
I know you probably can't hear me

278
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:06,598
and you're feeling this big push to go towards the light,

279
00:15:06,665 --> 00:15:11,177
where everything's all halos and all-you-can-eat buffets and stuff.

280
00:15:12,784 --> 00:15:16,055
And, I mean, sharing your organs is really great and all.

281
00:15:18,196 --> 00:15:19,706
But I think you have a family.

282
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:22,262
I can feel it.

283
00:15:22,968 --> 00:15:26,690
So I think it'd be really great if you could do me a favor and...

284
00:15:27,934 --> 00:15:28,892
get better.

285
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:31,446
Just...

286
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,030
live.

287
00:15:37,178 --> 00:15:39,198
So, you think you can give that a shot, for me?

288
00:16:01,317 --> 00:16:02,290
Oh, no.

289
00:16:04,135 --> 00:16:04,859
Meredith!

290
00:16:05,951 --> 00:16:06,545
Meredith.

291
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:07,691
- What?
- He's crashing.

292
00:16:07,952 --> 00:16:09,672
Well, what are you doing? Call a code!

293
00:16:09,745 --> 00:16:11,839
I can't -- I'm not supposed to. He's brain-dead.

294
00:16:11,906 --> 00:16:14,005
If he's brain-dead, you have to let him go.

295
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:16,288
No.  It's only been 5 hours and 33 minutes.

296
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:18,014
He's supposed to get six hours.

297
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:21,460
We can't do anything. It's not our place to make that call.

298
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,664
He's a person.

299
00:16:22,904 --> 00:16:23,983
We're doctors.

300
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:26,206
We should have every right to make that call.

301
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:30,513
We can't just stand here and do nothing while he dies.

302
00:16:30,595 --> 00:16:33,129
He has a right to the next 27 minutes.

303
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,272
Screw it. I'll get the dopamine.

304
00:16:39,335 --> 00:16:41,604
You get the blood. We'll transfuse him.

305
00:16:48,806 --> 00:16:50,097
Do you feel any pain here?

306
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:51,668
No.

307
00:16:52,902 --> 00:16:56,482
You know, you really do have... beautiful eyelashes.

308
00:16:56,819 --> 00:16:59,712
Um... thank you.

309
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:01,268
Uh, what about here?

310
00:17:01,914 --> 00:17:02,718
No.

311
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:04,811
And nice eyes.

312
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:06,147
Kind.

313
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,266
I like a man with kind eyes.

314
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,299
Really? You think I have kind eyes?

315
00:17:11,517 --> 00:17:14,473
I mean, uh...  you can, um...

316
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:19,763
What are you examining me for?

317
00:17:19,845 --> 00:17:22,118
Oh, you know, just routine medical stuff.

318
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,715
You're doing very well.

319
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,521
Because I'm enjoying the view.

320
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:31,161
Okay... well...

321
00:17:31,923 --> 00:17:32,900
I got to go.

322
00:17:37,386 --> 00:17:38,405
He's stable.

323
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:40,980
For now. I had a radiologist look at his chest.

324
00:17:41,097 --> 00:17:42,864
He has a traumatic aortic injury.

325
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,292
It's gonna rupture and bleed out.

326
00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:45,364
So he needs surgery.

327
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,410
If he's gonna remain a viable organ donor.

328
00:17:47,488 --> 00:17:48,481
If he's gonna live.

329
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,570
- Izzie --
- No. I'm not giving up on him.

330
00:17:50,642 --> 00:17:52,855
He has the surgery -- he lives longer. That's the point.

331
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,176
I'm going to find the family. You guys get him into surgery.

332
00:17:56,596 --> 00:17:58,607
She's vice president of fantasyland.

333
00:17:58,736 --> 00:18:00,999
Who do we go to for surgery -- Bailey?

334
00:18:01,322 --> 00:18:02,745
We need to go higher than Bailey.

335
00:18:04,286 --> 00:18:05,151
Dr. Burke.

336
00:18:06,062 --> 00:18:07,216
- Hello!
- Okay.

337
00:18:11,072 --> 00:18:15,909
Dr. Burke, um, I know you're busy, but our John Doe needs an aortic repair.

338
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:18,525
The guy from this morning?

339
00:18:19,257 --> 00:18:20,481
Isn't he legally dead?

340
00:18:21,044 --> 00:18:23,984
Well, yeah -- he's kinda still around.

341
00:18:24,445 --> 00:18:27,532
We gave him two units P.R.V.C.S and put him on pressors.

342
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:28,735
On whose orders?

343
00:18:32,636 --> 00:18:33,379
Mine.

344
00:18:37,356 --> 00:18:41,263
You get a brain-dead John Doe a blood transfusion without consulting anyone.

345
00:18:41,335 --> 00:18:43,040
And now you want me to repair his heart?

346
00:18:43,174 --> 00:18:44,556
Well, yes.

347
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,372
You do enjoy crossing the line, don't you?

348
00:18:50,438 --> 00:18:53,378
He is an excellent candidate for organ donation.

349
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,522
I am a surgeon. I save lives.

350
00:18:55,589 --> 00:18:57,152
This guy is already dead.

351
00:18:57,244 --> 00:18:59,271
Now, this is the men's room.

352
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:01,734
Either whip one out or close the door.

353
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:07,985
- You're asking my advice?
- Yes.

354
00:19:08,062 --> 00:19:10,777
- Now who's chasing?
- Not funny. This is important.

355
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:11,744
Okay.

356
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:13,550
You want to get around Burke?

357
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:16,650
You gotta find a way to get the chief involved.

358
00:19:20,087 --> 00:19:21,072
What'd I do?

359
00:19:21,185 --> 00:19:24,261
How close a match for the liver is your guy to our John Doe?

360
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:28,031
Very. Same type, same size. U.N.O.S. couldn't find a better match. Why?

361
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,027
He's the chief's V.I.P., right?

362
00:19:30,387 --> 00:19:31,154
Right.

363
00:19:31,511 --> 00:19:34,193
How much would you kill to be in on a transplant surgery?

364
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,335
You underestimate me.

365
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:38,727
I'm not a baby.

366
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:40,190
I'm  your colleague.

367
00:19:40,698 --> 00:19:41,968
You don't have to manipulate me.

368
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:44,927
If you want something, all you have to do is ask.

369
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,604
We want you to go over Burke's head, to the chief.

370
00:19:48,848 --> 00:19:50,908
Ask me something easier.

371
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:52,714
Sir.

372
00:19:53,063 --> 00:19:54,475
O'malley. How's Mackie?

373
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:57,375
Fine. Actually, that's what I want to talk to you about.

374
00:19:57,855 --> 00:20:02,355
I kinda think that -- me and the other interns -- we think --

375
00:20:02,898 --> 00:20:05,228
O'malley, I'm not getting any younger.

376
00:20:05,782 --> 00:20:07,359
We found mackie a liver.

377
00:20:08,346 --> 00:20:10,071
We are so going to hell.

378
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:11,460
Burke is sending us straight to hell.

379
00:20:11,496 --> 00:20:12,785
On an express train.

380
00:20:12,852 --> 00:20:13,803
If it works.

381
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:16,483
What are you doing?

382
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:17,493
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

383
00:20:24,377 --> 00:20:25,218
Yes!

384
00:20:32,745 --> 00:20:33,743
Oh, crap.

385
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,054
Dr. Burke!

386
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:41,294
Dr. Burke!

387
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:44,816
Excellent work, sir.

388
00:20:45,426 --> 00:20:46,414
Excellent.

389
00:20:47,156 --> 00:20:47,903
Flawless.

390
00:20:48,468 --> 00:20:49,608
It's a shame he's brain-dead.

391
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:52,645
If he wasn't, he would be on his feet in a few days.

392
00:20:52,727 --> 00:20:55,188
I'm amazed at what's going on.

393
00:20:55,277 --> 00:20:57,008
I seriously hate that guy.

394
00:20:57,226 --> 00:20:58,564
Alex is vermin.

395
00:20:58,697 --> 00:21:00,452
That surgery is ours.

396
00:21:00,632 --> 00:21:02,091
At least Burke is doing the surgery.

397
00:21:02,182 --> 00:21:03,520
I don't care about Alex.

398
00:21:03,868 --> 00:21:06,018
George, you did good.

399
00:21:06,606 --> 00:21:09,802
I'm going to have to dodge Burke for the rest of my career.

400
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:14,046
He could kill me and make it look like an accident.

401
00:21:17,252 --> 00:21:18,465
The police called.

402
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:21,757
They've identified your John Doe. His wife is on the way.

403
00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:38,279
Oh, my god.

404
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,039
Kevin!

405
00:21:42,662 --> 00:21:44,460
- It's okay.
- Oh, my god!

406
00:21:44,717 --> 00:21:47,630
Mrs. Davidson, this is Dr. Stevens.

407
00:21:49,816 --> 00:21:52,892
Now, if you have any questions at all, please call me.

408
00:22:03,486 --> 00:22:06,718
Is there -- is there still a chance?

409
00:22:09,553 --> 00:22:11,755
We can hold off till morning,

410
00:22:12,616 --> 00:22:14,694
but if there's still no change, we'd...

411
00:22:15,981 --> 00:22:19,333
we'd like to talk to you about organ donation.

412
00:22:31,886 --> 00:22:32,701
Mackie?

413
00:22:34,376 --> 00:22:35,466
How are we treating ya?

414
00:22:36,771 --> 00:22:37,750
Oh, fine.

415
00:22:39,802 --> 00:22:42,363
Except that beautiful boy won't let me smoke.

416
00:22:43,366 --> 00:22:45,142
You should reprimand him.

417
00:22:46,089 --> 00:22:47,856
Make him change bedpans.

418
00:22:51,082 --> 00:22:51,912
Mackie.

419
00:22:53,028 --> 00:22:55,516
That beautiful boy may have found you a liver.

420
00:23:22,308 --> 00:23:23,932
God, I smell good!

421
00:23:25,797 --> 00:23:27,230
You know what it is?

422
00:23:27,792 --> 00:23:30,604
It's the smell of open-heart surgery.

423
00:23:32,218 --> 00:23:34,735
It's awesome. It is awesome.

424
00:23:35,231 --> 00:23:36,266
You gotta smell me.

425
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,534
I don't want to smell you.

426
00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:39,913
Oh, yes, you do.

427
00:23:39,993 --> 00:23:42,283
You have got to be kidding me!

428
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:46,323
Okay, I have more important things to deal with than you.

429
00:23:46,374 --> 00:23:49,758
I have roommates, boy problems, and family problems.

430
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:52,824
You wanna act like a little frat-boy bitch? That's fine.

431
00:23:52,885 --> 00:23:55,557
You wanna take credit for your saves and everybody else's?

432
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:56,654
That's fine, too.

433
00:23:56,719 --> 00:23:58,483
Just stay outta my face.

434
00:23:58,545 --> 00:24:02,420
And for the record, you smell like crap!

435
00:24:09,227 --> 00:24:10,605
She attacked me.

436
00:24:11,405 --> 00:24:13,069
Meri! Meri! Meri! Meri!

437
00:24:15,874 --> 00:24:18,234
You know what? You might want to leave before I change my mind

438
00:24:18,286 --> 00:24:22,019
and let her beat you to a pulp with her tiny, ineffectual fists.

439
00:24:32,377 --> 00:24:33,139
What?

440
00:24:34,107 --> 00:24:35,024
Nothing.

441
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:38,291
It's just...

442
00:24:44,926 --> 00:24:45,725
nothing.

443
00:24:56,009 --> 00:24:57,510
Oh! This one is skin grafting!

444
00:24:57,603 --> 00:24:59,134
Skin grafting? No way!

445
00:24:59,317 --> 00:25:00,922
I've never seen that done before.

446
00:25:01,402 --> 00:25:03,087
Are those my mother's surgical tapes?

447
00:25:03,153 --> 00:25:05,098
We should watch the skin grafting one first.

448
00:25:05,994 --> 00:25:08,262
Where did all this stuff come from?

449
00:25:08,524 --> 00:25:11,751
Oh. I unpacked some of your mother's things. I was upset.

450
00:25:11,821 --> 00:25:13,666
And when I'm upset, I like to nest.

451
00:25:15,377 --> 00:25:17,269
Oooh -- hemipelvectomy!

452
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,533
I think we should watch this one first.

453
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:21,105
No. No.

454
00:25:21,714 --> 00:25:25,411
We're not watching my mother's surgery tapes. We're not unpacking boxes.

455
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:29,634
We're not having long conversations where we celebrate the moments of our lives.

456
00:25:29,865 --> 00:25:31,294
And use a coaster!

457
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,709
I ordered chinese food.

458
00:25:34,758 --> 00:25:36,644
I hate chinese food!

459
00:25:40,223 --> 00:25:42,415
They're everywhere. All the time.

460
00:25:42,516 --> 00:25:46,326
Izzie's all perky, and George does this thing where he's helpful and considerate.

461
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:50,612
They share food and they say things and they move things and they breathe.

462
00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:52,644
They're like happy.

463
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:54,605
Kick them out.

464
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:58,174
I can't kick them out. They just moved in. I asked them to move in.

465
00:25:58,241 --> 00:26:01,506
So, what -- you're gonna repress everything in some deep, dark, twisted place

466
00:26:01,552 --> 00:26:03,022
until one day you snap and kill them?

467
00:26:03,536 --> 00:26:04,251
Yep.

468
00:26:05,338 --> 00:26:06,617
This is why we are friends.

469
00:26:08,246 --> 00:26:11,097
Why is the nazi making us stay in the pit two days in a row?

470
00:26:11,275 --> 00:26:12,141
Leftovers.

471
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,252
Leftovers.

472
00:26:13,499 --> 00:26:18,582
Got to get the cyclists who were too drunk, stupid, or scared to get to a hospital yesterday.

473
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,907
Meanwhile, she gets to do a freakin' organ harvest.

474
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:23,348
It kills you, doesn't it? That women caught the harvest.

475
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:26,170
No, it kills me that anybody got the harvest but me.

476
00:26:26,273 --> 00:26:28,443
Boobs do not factor into this equation.

477
00:26:28,842 --> 00:26:30,902
Unless, uh, you want to show me yours.

478
00:26:34,276 --> 00:26:36,820
- I'm gonna become a lesbian.
- Me too.

479
00:26:43,132 --> 00:26:46,358
Now, Mrs. Davidson, this form simply says you consent to the donation

480
00:26:46,426 --> 00:26:50,000
of your husband's major organs -- heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys.

481
00:26:56,307 --> 00:26:58,227
Now, I need to ask you a few questions.

482
00:26:58,341 --> 00:27:00,177
Are you willing to donate his corneas?

483
00:27:01,939 --> 00:27:03,296
You want his eyes?

484
00:27:06,655 --> 00:27:10,536
Um, corneal transplants can give someone back their sight.

485
00:27:14,688 --> 00:27:16,245
I suppose that's okay.

486
00:27:32,306 --> 00:27:33,448
What about his skin?

487
00:27:34,872 --> 00:27:35,797
What?

488
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,145
It's used to help burn victims.

489
00:27:42,624 --> 00:27:45,142
You want to cut off his skin?

490
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:49,320
What about the funeral?

491
00:27:50,513 --> 00:27:53,732
You want me to have a funeral and have people look at him --

492
00:27:53,999 --> 00:27:58,829
have his daughter look at her father and he doesn't have any skin?

493
00:27:59,642 --> 00:28:01,379
It's his skin!

494
00:28:24,096 --> 00:28:24,981
What are you doing?

495
00:28:26,616 --> 00:28:27,747
I'm not a people person.

496
00:28:27,894 --> 00:28:28,737
No kidding.

497
00:28:28,898 --> 00:28:32,068
I can't do that. I can't talk to the families of patients. I'm sorry.

498
00:28:33,783 --> 00:28:34,720
What's his name?

499
00:28:35,575 --> 00:28:38,053
- Who?
- The patient. What's his name?

500
00:28:40,525 --> 00:28:41,699
Kevin Davidson.

501
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:46,292
Remember that. Not "gorked guy." Not "John Doe." Kevin Davidson.

502
00:28:46,353 --> 00:28:51,222
He's someone's husband, someone's son -- not a collection of body parts to harvest.

503
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:52,215
A person.

504
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:54,750
Now, no one said this was easy.

505
00:29:15,842 --> 00:29:17,047
I owe you, George.

506
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:19,987
No, you don't owe me anything.

507
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,291
I'm just happy we found a liver.

508
00:29:24,585 --> 00:29:26,315
Well, when I get out of here,

509
00:29:27,181 --> 00:29:30,939
how about I take you and my new liver out for a night on the town?

510
00:29:32,044 --> 00:29:32,987
What do you say?

511
00:29:37,323 --> 00:29:41,056
Uh, Mr. Mackie, no offense or anything...

512
00:29:41,241 --> 00:29:43,995
you're very handsome, but, I, um...

513
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:47,844
I'm not... I mean, you're not my type, because...

514
00:29:48,895 --> 00:29:50,758
you're a man, and...

515
00:29:51,286 --> 00:29:53,401
George, I never thought you were gay.

516
00:29:55,111 --> 00:29:58,130
- You didn't?
- Oh, child, please. You? Gay?

517
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,520
I'm sick, George, not blind.

518
00:30:02,298 --> 00:30:03,773
They why have...

519
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:08,904
Oh, because dying is a "get out of jail free" card.

520
00:30:09,376 --> 00:30:13,563
I can be as bold as I want, and there's nothing anybody can say about it.

521
00:30:13,757 --> 00:30:14,894
So I flirt.

522
00:30:16,554 --> 00:30:19,406
Haven't you ever been attracted to someone you know you couldn't have?

523
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:21,075
Well...

524
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,421
I'm...

525
00:30:23,977 --> 00:30:24,571
no.

526
00:30:25,355 --> 00:30:26,358
What's her name?

527
00:30:28,503 --> 00:30:29,374
There's no...

528
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:31,473
I'm not...

529
00:30:32,296 --> 00:30:33,104
you know...

530
00:30:33,946 --> 00:30:35,646
This is really...

531
00:30:36,229 --> 00:30:37,310
not...

532
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:42,219
Meredith.

533
00:30:47,283 --> 00:30:48,471
Meredith.

534
00:30:51,411 --> 00:30:53,887
To be young and in love.

535
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,534
- Let's go get that liver, shall we?
- No, I'm sorry, I --

536
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:20,656
I never liked harvesting.

537
00:31:21,457 --> 00:31:22,157
Why?

538
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,088
Like I said, I'm a surgeon. I save lives.

539
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,665
This ends one.

540
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,039
I know you tried, so no hard feelings, okay?

541
00:31:39,452 --> 00:31:40,680
I was just...

542
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:41,894
You were saying goodbye.

543
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:02,788
What's Viper doing here?

544
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:05,855
Probably crashed his bike -- again.

545
00:32:06,286 --> 00:32:07,694
How long has he been waiting?

546
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,413
I don't know.

547
00:32:09,815 --> 00:32:11,647
I've been busy on real cases.

548
00:32:11,948 --> 00:32:13,203
He's all yours.

549
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,610
Viper.

550
00:32:16,706 --> 00:32:17,473
Viper?

551
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:19,736
Are you okay?!

552
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:23,853
Viper!

553
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:36,848
Call the O.R., Tell them we're coming, and page Dr. Bailey. Alex, let's go.

554
00:32:37,252 --> 00:32:39,582
Alex, push the damn gurney!

555
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:41,251
Clear the way.

556
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,817
Coming through.

557
00:32:43,237 --> 00:32:44,446
Somebody get the elevator.

558
00:32:44,522 --> 00:32:47,354
Hurry. I don't know how long I can keep this wound closed.

559
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:54,496
Move faster. Damn it!

560
00:33:01,097 --> 00:33:02,157
This a new one?

561
00:33:02,222 --> 00:33:04,251
Somebody get her off my patient.

562
00:33:05,345 --> 00:33:08,735
Meredith, go get cleaned up, and, Alex, get back downstairs.

563
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:09,406
Yeah, but I helped.

564
00:33:09,477 --> 00:33:13,748
They tell me in the pit you only want to take the hot cases.

565
00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:18,678
Every pack of interns, there's always one fool running around trying to show off.

566
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,592
And, Alex, this time that fool is you. Get out.

567
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,587
Somebody get me something to stand on. Lower this table.

568
00:33:27,857 --> 00:33:29,727
The mountain is gonna have to come to me.

569
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:33,726
Count backwards from 10 for me.

570
00:33:34,144 --> 00:33:35,201
Richard.

571
00:33:36,522 --> 00:33:37,836
You're a good friend.

572
00:33:38,478 --> 00:33:39,629
The best.

573
00:33:39,871 --> 00:33:42,856
Shut up and count backwards already, Mack.

574
00:33:43,969 --> 00:33:45,032
Ten...

575
00:33:46,578 --> 00:33:47,694
nine...

576
00:33:48,712 --> 00:33:50,044
eight...

577
00:33:51,784 --> 00:33:53,034
sevuhhh...

578
00:34:02,506 --> 00:34:03,659
I'm not gonna stay.

579
00:34:04,301 --> 00:34:06,217
It's your job. You have to.

580
00:34:06,915 --> 00:34:08,594
You're better at this part than me.

581
00:34:09,736 --> 00:34:11,881
I don't want to watch him get taken apart.

582
00:34:13,408 --> 00:34:16,244
Look at the vultures -- waiting to pick him clean.

583
00:34:19,002 --> 00:34:21,738
Every last one of them represents someone somewhere

584
00:34:21,803 --> 00:34:24,210
who's gonna live because of Kevin.

585
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:26,945
Here. Put it on.

586
00:34:27,471 --> 00:34:29,100
I'll be waiting next door when you're ready.

587
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:30,349
Everyone's waiting.

588
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:35,495
Okay, doctors, let's get this over with.

589
00:36:54,024 --> 00:36:54,836
Izzie?

590
00:36:56,865 --> 00:36:59,302
I'm gonna sew him up -- for his family.

591
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:22,597
You do it.

592
00:37:23,297 --> 00:37:23,940
What?

593
00:37:24,139 --> 00:37:24,734
You do it.

594
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:33,175
Mrs. Davidson.

595
00:37:34,424 --> 00:37:36,233
He's ready, if you'd like to see him.

596
00:38:05,305 --> 00:38:07,246
This lovely group's his friends.

597
00:38:07,357 --> 00:38:09,888
Uh, you all belong to -- what's his name?

598
00:38:09,968 --> 00:38:11,541
- Viper.
- V-viper.

599
00:38:11,628 --> 00:38:12,879
Yeah, we were in the race.

600
00:38:12,944 --> 00:38:14,286
How is he? Is he okay?

601
00:38:15,047 --> 00:38:16,180
Is he okay?

602
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:19,883
No. No, he's not okay at all.

603
00:38:19,954 --> 00:38:24,407
He hurled his body down a concrete mountain at full speed for no good reason.

604
00:38:24,962 --> 00:38:28,776
Yeah, I know you all pierce yourselves and smoke up

605
00:38:28,837 --> 00:38:31,908
and generally treat your bodies like your grungy asses can't break down.

606
00:38:32,073 --> 00:38:37,145
Hey, that's fine. You want to kill yourselves flying down a concrete mountain, go to it --

607
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:41,847
but there are other people walking, people driving, people trying to live their lives,

608
00:38:41,907 --> 00:38:47,141
and one of them got his brains scrambled today because one of you little sniveling snot rag --

609
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:50,360
- Dr. Bailey.
- Yeah, so. Okay, no.

610
00:38:50,443 --> 00:38:53,438
Your friend, Viper, as far as I'm concerned, is not okay.

611
00:38:57,743 --> 00:39:01,441
She's, um... really tired.

612
00:39:02,129 --> 00:39:06,152
- But... Viper's gonna make it.
- Cool.

613
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,314
He's gonna live.

614
00:39:07,805 --> 00:39:09,012
Thanks.

615
00:39:17,614 --> 00:39:18,986
It's not the chase.

616
00:39:19,772 --> 00:39:20,437
What?

617
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:21,942
You and me.

618
00:39:23,298 --> 00:39:25,072
It is not the thrill of the chase.

619
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:27,410
It's not a game.

620
00:39:27,752 --> 00:39:28,461
It's...

621
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,689
It's your tiny, ineffectual fists.

622
00:39:36,304 --> 00:39:37,129
And your hair.

623
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,070
My hair?

624
00:39:41,415 --> 00:39:42,317
It smells good.

625
00:39:44,362 --> 00:39:45,735
And you're very, very bossy.

626
00:39:46,996 --> 00:39:47,985
Keeps me in line.

627
00:39:54,419 --> 00:39:56,366
I'm still not going out with you.

628
00:39:58,462 --> 00:39:59,770
You say that now.

629
00:40:16,354 --> 00:40:17,712
How'd it go?

630
00:40:18,629 --> 00:40:20,032
Very smoothly.

631
00:40:21,172 --> 00:40:21,885
Damn.

632
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,434
That means I'm gonna have to quit smoking.

633
00:40:44,829 --> 00:40:48,284
Ah, the pretty ones always come crawling back.

634
00:40:56,358 --> 00:40:59,744
There's another way to survive this competition --

635
00:40:59,845 --> 00:41:02,221
a way no one ever seems to tell you about,

636
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:04,899
one you have to learn for yourself.

637
00:41:05,635 --> 00:41:06,727
Number five --

638
00:41:08,263 --> 00:41:10,986
it's not about the race at all.

639
00:41:11,432 --> 00:41:13,645
There are no winners or losers.

640
00:41:14,749 --> 00:41:18,462
Victories are counted by the number of lives saved.

641
00:41:33,507 --> 00:41:37,580
Oh, okay, this is the best part. Watch. She pulls the flap of skin down over the face.

642
00:41:39,568 --> 00:41:40,462
We were --

643
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:41,414
Hi.

644
00:41:41,774 --> 00:41:43,314
We were -- we were just, uh...

645
00:41:44,037 --> 00:41:45,174
Christina made us.

646
00:41:49,597 --> 00:41:55,346
And once in a while, if you're smart, the life you save could be your own.

647
00:41:55,577 --> 00:41:56,909
What are we watching?

648
00:41:57,201 --> 00:42:02,883
- Oooh. This is the one where my mother... 
- Literally pulls this guy's face off.

649
00:42:03,014 --> 00:42:03,703
Yeah.

650
00:42:05,571 --> 00:42:07,219
Come on!

651
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,768
Oh! Holy crap!

652
00:42:16,827 --> 00:42:21,188
