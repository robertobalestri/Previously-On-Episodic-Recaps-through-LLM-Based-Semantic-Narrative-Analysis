[meredith_grey] is in bed.
It's 4:37 am and raining.
[izzie_stevens] stands beside [meredith_grey]'s bed holding coffee.
[izzie_stevens] says [george_omalley]'s bedroom is bigger than [izzie_stevens]'s.
[meredith_grey] gets up but trips and falls.
[meredith_grey] limps away.
[izzie_stevens] follows [meredith_grey] and explains [izzie_stevens] needs more space for [izzie_stevens]'s clothes.
[george_omalley] interrupts, saying [george_omalley] got there first.
[izzie_stevens] insists it's [meredith_grey]'s decision.
[george_omalley] says [george_omalley]'s room is only two inches bigger.
[izzie_stevens] argues [george_omalley] has a bigger closet.
[george_omalley] suggests [izzie_stevens] put [izzie_stevens]'s clothes elsewhere.
[izzie_stevens] says everywhere is filled with [ellis_grey]'s boxes.
[izzie_stevens] and [george_omalley] ask [meredith_grey] if they can store the boxes or unpack some items like lamps, paintings, or pillows to make the house cozier.
[izzie_stevens] and [george_omalley] ask to watch surgical tapes from [ellis_grey]'s boxes.
[meredith_grey] slams the door in [izzie_stevens]'s and [george_omalley]'s faces.
[meredith_grey] re-opens it, takes [izzie_stevens]'s coffee, and shuts the door again.
[meredith_grey] leans against the door, holding the coffee.
[miranda_bailey] stands on a street corner, looking confused.
[dr_derek_shepherd] joins [miranda_bailey] and says hello.
[miranda_bailey] tells [dr_derek_shepherd] to be quiet because something important is happening today, but [miranda_bailey] can't remember what.
[dr_derek_shepherd] starts to cross the road.
[miranda_bailey] gasps and grabs [dr_derek_shepherd] as several bike riders race past, and two crash.
At the hospital, [miranda_bailey] complains to the interns about the bikers, saying they're just fools killing themselves.
[alex_karev] asks [george_omalley] if [miranda_bailey] is off her medication.
[george_omalley] is surprised he never heard of the race.
[richard_webber], [preston_burke], and [dr_derek_shepherd] stand in front of the O.R. Schedule board.
They note it's well-organized, so they might finish early.
[miranda_bailey] tells [richard_webber], [preston_burke], and [dr_derek_shepherd] that "Dead baby bike race day" started 20 minutes ago.
[george_omalley] and [meredith_grey] explain that every year a bar holds an illegal underground bike race.
[miranda_bailey] complains again, saying it's crazy that bike messengers race against traffic for free tequila shots.
[miranda_bailey] says she needs someone on the OR floor.
The Chief needs help.
Everyone raises their hand except [meredith_grey].
[miranda_bailey] chooses [george_omalley].
[miranda_bailey] tells the others not to talk to the ER interns.
[miranda_bailey] says the ER interns don't know much.
The interns must sew quickly, discharge quickly, and take bodies to the OR immediately.
[miranda_bailey] warns the interns not to fight over patients.
The interns run and push for position.
The interns see injured bike riders everywhere.
[izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] hurry to get a patient.
[meredith_grey] sees a man with bicycle spokes in his side.
[alex_karev] and [meredith_grey] rush to the man.
Behind a curtain, [alex_karev] and [meredith_grey] argue over the patient.
The patient, [viper], pulls back the curtain.
[viper] asks if [alex_karev] and [meredith_grey] can remove the spokes so he can win his race.
[meredith_grey] tells [alex_karev] they need to run tests first.
[alex_karev] insists it's a superficial wound, not surgical.
[alex_karev] leaves [meredith_grey] to sew it up.
[cristina_yang], [izzie_stevens], and [dr_derek_shepherd] stand over a patient.
[cristina_yang] reports to [dr_derek_shepherd] about the patient: an unidentified man in his mid-thirties, hit by a car avoiding a bike.
The man's GCS is 3, pupils are fixed and dilated, and atropine was given for a low pulse.
[preston_burke] mentions the bike race claimed its first victim.
[izzie_stevens] asks if the patient will go to the O.R.
[dr_derek_shepherd] instructs [izzie_stevens] to do confirmatory tests.
If there's no response in six hours, [dr_derek_shepherd] says they should declare the patient brain dead.
[richard_webber] is in surgery.
[george_omalley] asks [richard_webber] if he should scrub in.
[richard_webber] says no and tells [george_omalley] to monitor [george_omalley]'s pre-op and post-op patients.
[richard_webber] asks [george_omalley] to pay special attention to [richard_webber]'s friend, [lloyd_mackie], in room 4451.
[lloyd_mackie] is in bed and lights a cigarette.
[george_omalley] tells [lloyd_mackie] to put it out because smoking kills.
[lloyd_mackie] replies that liver cancer will kill him, and cigarettes just speed it up.
[george_omalley] insists there is hope because [lloyd_mackie] is at the top of the donor list.
[lloyd_mackie] says he has been at the top for eight months.
[izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] are with their patient.
[izzie_stevens] worries the patient won't respond, and they have only 5 hours left.
[cristina_yang] says if the patient doesn't respond, he's already dead.
[cristina_yang] wants the patient to hurry and go into the light so she can get another case.
[izzie_stevens] looks shocked and says it's a waste of the patient's life.
[cristina_yang] adds it's a waste of good organs too, and [izzie_stevens] realizes [cristina_yang]'s plan.
[meredith_grey] sews up [viper], and [viper] flirts with [meredith_grey], calling her a "rocking babe."
[meredith_grey] ignores [viper]'s refusal and asks to do some tests, promising to finish in an hour.
[viper] insists he must finish the race.
Before leaving, [meredith_grey] asks [viper] to sign an AMA form.
[viper] signs and turns to leave but kisses [meredith_grey].
[viper] leaves, and [meredith_grey] shakes her head and starts stripping the bed.
[meredith_grey] sees [dr_derek_shepherd] outside.
[dr_derek_shepherd] enters, and [meredith_grey] asks [dr_derek_shepherd] if he's jealous.
[dr_derek_shepherd] says he's not but mentions he almost died today and wonders how [meredith_grey] would feel if they never went out.
[meredith_grey] tells [dr_derek_shepherd] to get over himself and asks if it's just the thrill of the chase for him.
[dr_derek_shepherd] looks surprised.
[meredith_grey] accuses [dr_derek_shepherd] of playing a game and storms out angrily.
[miranda_bailey] is performing surgery when [izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] enter.
[izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] ask if they can harvest their patient's organs.
[miranda_bailey] is surprised.
[miranda_bailey] tells [izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] to identify the patient, contact the patient's family, and get consent forms.
[izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] hurry away.
[alex_karev] walks to a desk where [george_omalley] is sitting.
[george_omalley] explains he is hiding from [lloyd_mackie].
[george_omalley] thinks [lloyd_mackie] might be attracted to him.
[alex_karev] jokingly tells [george_omalley] to go for it.
Then, [alex_karev] realizes [george_omalley] isn't gay.
[george_omalley] looks shocked as [alex_karev] walks away.
[izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] approach the other desk.
[george_omalley] asks [cristina_yang] if she or [meredith_grey] think he is gay.
[cristina_yang] asks [george_omalley] if he is.
When [george_omalley] says no, [cristina_yang] is surprised.
A woman approaches [izzie_stevens].
[cristina_yang] returns to the scene.
[izzie_stevens] gives the woman a hotel key card to give to the police.
After they finish talking, [george_omalley] asks [izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] if they have a potential organ donor.
[george_omalley] inquires about the blood type and checks the chart.
[izzie_stevens] talks to her [john_doe].
[izzie_stevens] says, "I know you probably can't hear me. You're feeling a push to go towards the light."
Sharing your organs is great, but I think you have a family. I can feel it. It'd be great if you could get better. Just live. Can you try that for me?
Suddenly, an alarm sounds. [john_doe] begins to crash, and [john_doe]'s pulse drops.
[meredith_grey] runs in.
After a few tense moments, [meredith_grey] and [izzie_stevens] decide to get dopamine and blood to transfuse [john_doe].
[george_omalley] examines Mackie.
Mackie flirts with [george_omalley].
[izzie_stevens] and [meredith_grey] go up some stairs.
[cristina_yang] meets [izzie_stevens] and [meredith_grey].
[cristina_yang] is excited about [john_doe] becoming an organ donor.
[izzie_stevens] insists [john_doe] should have surgery to live.
[cristina_yang] tells [meredith_grey] they need to go above [miranda_bailey] for their plan.
In the men's bathroom, [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] see [preston_burke].
[meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] ask [preston_burke] to repair [john_doe]'s heart.
[preston_burke] notes that [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] like to cross the line.
[preston_burke] tells [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] to either show a penis or leave.
[meredith_grey] asks [dr_derek_shepherd] for advice.
[dr_derek_shepherd] hesitantly suggests going over [preston_burke]'s head to the Chief.
[izzie_stevens], [meredith_grey], and [cristina_yang] ask [george_omalley] if [george_omalley] wants to join a transplant surgery.
[richard_webber] asks about Mackie.
[george_omalley] tells [richard_webber] they might have a liver for Mackie.
The Chief listens intently.
[alex_karev] sees [izzie_stevens], [meredith_grey], [cristina_yang], and [george_omalley] watching [george_omalley] and [richard_webber].
[preston_burke] walks by.
[richard_webber] stops [preston_burke] to discuss the surgery.
[preston_burke] looks at the other interns.
The interns hurry away.
[alex_karev] stays.
[preston_burke] turns to leave.
[alex_karev] follows [preston_burke].
In the open heart surgery, [alex_karev] assists [preston_burke].
The interns in the gallery glare at [alex_karev].
[izzie_stevens] is happy the patient is getting surgery.
A nurse enters and tells [izzie_stevens] that [john_doe] has been identified.
[shelley_davidson], the wife, is coming.
[dr_derek_shepherd] introduces [shelley_davidson] to [izzie_stevens].
[dr_derek_shepherd] leaves and tells [izzie_stevens] and [shelley_davidson] to page him if needed.
[izzie_stevens] tells [shelley_davidson] that [kevin], her husband, might wake up.
If [kevin] doesn't change by morning, [izzie_stevens] asks [shelley_davidson] if she's considered organ donation for [kevin].
[richard_webber] shakes Mackie's shoulder lightly.
[richard_webber] tells Mackie that [george_omalley] found him a liver.
Mackie looks at [richard_webber], then at [george_omalley].
Mackie's face starts to break up.
Mackie looks away, trying not to cry.
[richard_webber] pats Mackie's shoulder.
[george_omalley] leaves.
[alex_karev] enters the locker room to find [meredith_grey].
[alex_karev] tells [meredith_grey] he smells like open-heart surgery and nuzzles her hair.
[meredith_grey] grabs [alex_karev] and pushes him against the lockers by his shirt.
[meredith_grey] tells [alex_karev] to stay away and that he smells bad.
[meredith_grey] and [alex_karev] both see [dr_derek_shepherd].
[meredith_grey] returns to [meredith_grey]'s locker.
[meredith_grey] moves to confront [alex_karev] again.
[dr_derek_shepherd] tells [alex_karev] to leave.
[dr_derek_shepherd] pushes [alex_karev] out and closes the door.
[alex_karev] makes a face at [meredith_grey].
[meredith_grey] closes her locker and acts like she's leaving.
[dr_derek_shepherd] opens the door for [meredith_grey].
[meredith_grey] looks at [dr_derek_shepherd] for a moment, then walks away.
[meredith_grey] arrives home.
[izzie_stevens] and [george_omalley] are watching video tapes.
[meredith_grey] is angry and asks why [izzie_stevens] and [george_omalley] touched her mother's surgical tapes.
[meredith_grey] storms upstairs.
[izzie_stevens] and [george_omalley] exchange looks and giggle.
Outside the hospital, [meredith_grey] talks to [cristina_yang].
[meredith_grey] explains how perky and helpful [meredith_grey]'s roommates are.
[cristina_yang] suggests [meredith_grey] should kick [izzie_stevens] and [george_omalley] out.
[meredith_grey] decides she can't do that.
[alex_karev] comes up behind [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] as they enter the hospital.
[alex_karev] complains about being stuck in the pit again.
[cristina_yang] is getting the harvest surgery.
Annoyed with [alex_karev], [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] jokingly consider becoming lesbians.
The elevator dings, but [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] choose the stairs.
[cristina_yang] talks to [kevin]'s wife and little girl.
[cristina_yang] goes over the organ donation form with [shelley_davidson].
When [shelley_davidson] gets teary, [cristina_yang] leaves the room.
[cristina_yang] explains to [miranda_bailey] that [cristina_yang] isn't a people person and it's too hard.
[miranda_bailey] tells [cristina_yang] it won't be easy, but [kevin] is a person, not just for organ harvesting.
Remembering this, [cristina_yang] re-enters the room.
[cristina_yang] talks with [shelley_davidson] again.
Mackie begins to flirt with [george_omalley] again.
[george_omalley] awkwardly tries to tell Mackie he is not gay.
Mackie smiles and says Mackie never thought [george_omalley] was gay, and Mackie isn't either.
Mackie tells [george_omalley] that dying is like a free pass.
Mackie can be bold, and no one can say anything.
Mackie asks [george_omalley] if there was anyone [george_omalley] liked but couldn't have.
After a while, [george_omalley] says, "Meredith."
In the organ harvest preparation, [preston_burke] talks about not liking harvesting because [preston_burke] saves lives, and harvesting ends one.
[izzie_stevens] quietly tells [kevin] he did [kevin]'s best and says goodbye.
[meredith_grey] and [alex_karev] work in Trauma.
[meredith_grey] sees [viper] waiting in a chair.
[meredith_grey] asks [alex_karev] why [viper] is there and how long [viper] has been waiting.
[alex_karev] says [alex_karev] doesn't know because [alex_karev] was busy with real cases.
[viper] starts coughing, and [meredith_grey] walks towards [viper] worriedly.
[viper] tries to stand, and [meredith_grey] runs to [viper], but [viper] falls unconscious.
Blood comes out of [viper]'s mouth.
[meredith_grey] lifts [viper]'s shirt and sees [viper]'s stitches have ripped open.
The area around the stitches is swollen to the size of a small melon.
[meredith_grey] puts [viper] on a gurney.
[meredith_grey] climbs on top to hold [viper]'s wound closed.
[meredith_grey] asks a nurse to inform the OR that [meredith_grey] is coming and to page [miranda_bailey].
They arrive at the OR.
[miranda_bailey] tells [meredith_grey] to scrub in.
[meredith_grey] tells [alex_karev] to go back downstairs as punishment for only handling urgent cases.
Mackie is on the OR table, ready for anesthesia.
The Chief asks Mackie to count backwards.
Mackie counts and quickly falls asleep.
[izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] scrub in.
[richard_webber] and [preston_burke] enter.
[richard_webber] tells [izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] he'll be next door when they're ready.
They begin the operation.
The organs are placed in plastic bags and special sealed containers.
The liver is placed on ice.
[george_omalley] takes the liver and gives it to [richard_webber].
[richard_webber] puts the liver in Mackie.
Meanwhile, an alarm starts beeping.
The heart is being removed.
Everyone prepares to leave.
[izzie_stevens] stays behind.
[cristina_yang] looks back at [izzie_stevens].
[izzie_stevens] says she wants to sew Mackie up for his family.
[cristina_yang] decides to help [izzie_stevens].
Later, [cristina_yang] and [izzie_stevens] meet [shelley_davidson].
[cristina_yang] and [izzie_stevens] tell [shelley_davidson] that Mackie is ready.
[cristina_yang] looks thoughtfully at [viper]'s friends.
[viper]'s friends are also waiting.
[miranda_bailey] and [meredith_grey] walk out to see [viper]'s friends.
[viper]'s friends ask if [viper] is okay.
[miranda_bailey] starts shouting, asking if [viper] is okay.
No, [viper] is not okay at all.
[viper] threw himself down a concrete hill at full speed for no reason.
People do risky things like piercing and smoking, acting like their bodies can't get hurt.
If you want to risk your life on a concrete hill, that's your choice.
But remember, others are walking, driving, and living their lives there too.
Today, someone got hurt because of reckless behavior.
[meredith_grey] interrupts, and [miranda_bailey] calms down, saying she thinks [viper] is not fine, then leaves angrily.
[meredith_grey] awkwardly explains that [miranda_bailey] is tired but assures [viper]'s friends that [viper] will be okay.
In the locker room, [meredith_grey] packs her things.
[dr_derek_shepherd] enters and closes the door.
[dr_derek_shepherd] tells [meredith_grey] it's not about the chase or a game; it's her hair.
[meredith_grey] raises her eyebrows, and [dr_derek_shepherd] explains it smells nice.
[dr_derek_shepherd] also mentions [meredith_grey]'s bossiness.
[meredith_grey] tells [dr_derek_shepherd] she still won't go out with him.
[dr_derek_shepherd] leaves, saying, "You say that now."
[george_omalley] tells Mackie the surgery went well.
Mackie sighs and realizes Mackie must quit smoking.
Mackie smiles and holds [george_omalley]'s hand.
[meredith_grey] opens her front door.
Inside, [izzie_stevens], [cristina_yang], and [george_omalley] are eating pizza and drinking beer.
[izzie_stevens], [cristina_yang], and [george_omalley] are watching a surgical tape.
Everyone stops to look at [meredith_grey].
[george_omalley] quickly says [cristina_yang] made them watch the tapes.
[cristina_yang] glares at [george_omalley].
[meredith_grey] asks what they are watching.
[meredith_grey] sits down and grabs some popcorn.
They watch for a few seconds.
Suddenly, they all recoil, screaming and laughing in shock at the tape.
