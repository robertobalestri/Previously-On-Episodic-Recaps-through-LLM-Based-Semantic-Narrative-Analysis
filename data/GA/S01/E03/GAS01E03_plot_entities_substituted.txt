Meredith is in bed at 4:37 am while it rains.
[izzie_stevens] stands beside Meredith with coffee, mentioning that [george_omalley]'s room is bigger than hers.
Meredith gets up, trips, and falls.
Meredith limps away.
[izzie_stevens] follows Meredith, explaining [izzie_stevens] needs more space for her clothes.
[george_omalley] interrupts, saying [george_omalley] was there first, but [izzie_stevens] insists it's Meredith's decision.
[george_omalley] argues his room is only slightly bigger, but [izzie_stevens] points out [george_omalley]'s larger closet.
[george_omalley] suggests [izzie_stevens] store her clothes elsewhere, but [izzie_stevens] says Meredith's mother's boxes fill the space.
[izzie_stevens] and [george_omalley] ask Meredith if they can store the boxes or unpack items like lamps, paintings, or pillows to make the house cozier.
[izzie_stevens] and [george_omalley] ask Meredith if they can watch surgical tapes from Meredith's mother's boxes.
Meredith shuts the door on them, then reopens it to take [izzie_stevens]'s coffee before closing it again.
Meredith leans against the door, holding the coffee.
[miranda_bailey] stands on a street corner, looking confused.
[derek_shepherd] joins [miranda_bailey] and greets her, but [miranda_bailey] tells him to be quiet because something important is happening today, though [miranda_bailey] can't remember what.
[derek_shepherd] starts to cross the road, and [miranda_bailey] gasps, pulling [derek_shepherd] back as several bike riders race past, with two crashing.
At the hospital, [miranda_bailey] complains to the interns about the reckless bike riders.
[alex_karev] asks [george_omalley] if [miranda_bailey] is off her medication, and [george_omalley] is surprised [alex_karev] hasn't heard of the race.
[richard_webber], [preston_burke], and [derek_shepherd] look at the O.R.
[richard_webber] notes the schedule board is well-organized, so they might finish early.
[miranda_bailey] informs [richard_webber], [preston_burke], and [derek_shepherd] that "Dead baby bike race day" started 20 minutes ago.
[george_omalley] and Meredith explain that every year, a bar hosts an illegal underground bike race.
[miranda_bailey] complains again about the bike messengers racing against traffic for free tequila shots.
[miranda_bailey] tells the interns that the Chief needs help on the OR floor.
Everyone except Meredith volunteers, and [miranda_bailey] chooses [george_omalley].
[miranda_bailey] warns the interns not to interact with the ER interns, who she thinks are inexperienced.
[miranda_bailey] instructs them to work quickly, discharging patients and moving bodies to the OR immediately.
[miranda_bailey] also tells them not to fight over patients.
The interns rush to find positions and see injured bike riders everywhere.
[izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] hurry to get a patient.
Meredith notices a man with bicycle spokes in his side.
[alex_karev] and Meredith both run to him.
Behind a curtain, [alex_karev] and Meredith argue over the patient.
The patient, named [viper], interrupts and asks them to remove the spokes so he can continue his race.
Meredith tells [alex_karev] they need to run tests first.
[alex_karev] insists it's a superficial wound and not surgical, then leaves Meredith to stitch it up.
[cristina_yang], [izzie_stevens], and [derek_shepherd] examine a patient.
[cristina_yang] informs [derek_shepherd] that the patient is an unidentified man in his mid-thirties, hit by a car avoiding a bike.
[cristina_yang] describes the man's condition as having a GCS of 3, fixed and dilated pupils, and atropine given for a low pulse.
[preston_burke] mentions that the bike race has claimed its first victim.
[izzie_stevens] asks [derek_shepherd] if the patient will go to the O.R.
[derek_shepherd] instructs [izzie_stevens] to do confirmatory tests and says if there is no response in six hours, they should declare the man brain dead.
[richard_webber] is in surgery when [george_omalley] asks if he should join.
[richard_webber] tells [george_omalley] no and instructs him to monitor his pre-op and post-op patients.
[richard_webber] emphasizes paying special attention to a friend named [lloyd_mackie] in room 4451.
[lloyd_mackie] is in bed and lights a cigarette.
[george_omalley] tells [lloyd_mackie] to put it out, saying smoking is deadly.
[lloyd_mackie] responds that liver cancer will kill him anyway, and cigarettes just speed it up.
[george_omalley] insists there is hope because [lloyd_mackie] is at the top of the donor list.
[lloyd_mackie] replies he has been waiting there for eight months.
[izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] are with their patient.
[izzie_stevens] is worried the man won't respond, and they have only 5 hours left.
[cristina_yang] explains that if the man doesn't respond, it means he's already dead.
[cristina_yang] adds she wants the man to hurry up and go into the light so she can take another case.
[izzie_stevens] is shocked and says it's a waste of the man's life.
[cristina_yang] mentions it's also a waste of good organs, and [izzie_stevens] realizes [cristina_yang]'s plan.
Meredith is sewing up [viper].
While Meredith works, [viper] flirts with her, calling her attractive.
Meredith ignores [viper]'s refusal and asks him to let her run some tests, promising it would only take an hour.
[viper] declines, saying he needs to finish the race.
Before [viper] leaves, Meredith asks him to sign an AMA form.
After signing, [viper] starts to leave but turns back, kisses Meredith, and then departs.
Meredith shakes her head and begins to strip the bed.
Meredith notices [derek_shepherd] standing outside.
[derek_shepherd] comes in, and Meredith asks if [derek_shepherd] is jealous.
[derek_shepherd] denies it but mentions he almost died today and wonders how Meredith would feel if she never got to date him.
Meredith tells [derek_shepherd] to stop being self-centered and questions if he's just interested in the chase.
[derek_shepherd] seems surprised, but Meredith insists it's just a game for him.
Upset, Meredith leaves the room.
Meanwhile, [miranda_bailey] is performing surgery when [izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] enter.
[izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] ask [miranda_bailey] if they can take their patient's organs.
[miranda_bailey], surprised, tells [izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] to identify the patient, contact the family, and get consent forms.
[izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] quickly leave to do this.
[alex_karev] approaches [george_omalley] at a desk.
[george_omalley] explains he is hiding from [lloyd_mackie] because he thinks [lloyd_mackie] might be attracted to him.
[alex_karev] suggests [george_omalley] should pursue it but then realizes [george_omalley] isn't gay.
[george_omalley] is shocked as [alex_karev] walks away.
[izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] arrive at another desk.
[george_omalley] asks [cristina_yang] if she or Meredith think he is gay.
[cristina_yang] asks if [george_omalley] is, and when he says no, [cristina_yang] is surprised.
A woman approaches [izzie_stevens], and [cristina_yang] returns.
[izzie_stevens] gives the woman a hotel key card to pass to the police.
After their conversation, [george_omalley] asks [izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] if they have a potential organ donor.
[george_omalley] inquires about the blood type and checks the chart.
[izzie_stevens] looks at her patient, [kevin_davidson], and tells [kevin_davidson] she believes he has a family.
[izzie_stevens] hopes [kevin_davidson] will recover and live.
Suddenly, an alarm sounds, and [kevin_davidson]'s condition worsens as his pulse drops.
Meredith rushes in, and they decide to get dopamine and blood for a transfusion.
[george_omalley] examines [lloyd_mackie], who flirts with [george_omalley].
[izzie_stevens] and Meredith go up some stairs.
[cristina_yang] meets [izzie_stevens] and Meredith and is excited about their patient possibly becoming an organ donor.
[izzie_stevens] insists [kevin_davidson] should have surgery to survive.
[cristina_yang] tells Meredith they need to go above [miranda_bailey] for their plan.
In the men's bathroom, Meredith and [cristina_yang] see [preston_burke].
Meredith and [cristina_yang] ask [preston_burke] to repair [kevin_davidson]'s heart.
[preston_burke] notes they often cross the line and tells Meredith and [cristina_yang] to leave.
Meredith asks Dr. [derek_shepherd] [derek_shepherd] for advice.
Dr. [derek_shepherd] [derek_shepherd] hesitantly suggests going over [preston_burke]'s head to the Chief.
[izzie_stevens], Meredith, and [cristina_yang] ask [george_omalley] if he wants to join a transplant surgery.
[richard_webber] asks [george_omalley] about [lloyd_mackie]'s condition.
[george_omalley] mentions they might have a liver for [lloyd_mackie], and [richard_webber] listens carefully.
[alex_karev] notices the others watching [george_omalley] and [richard_webber].
[preston_burke] walks by, and [richard_webber] stops him to discuss the surgery.
[preston_burke] notices the other interns quickly leaving.
[alex_karev] stays behind and follows [preston_burke] when he turns to go.
During the open-heart surgery, [alex_karev] helps [preston_burke].
The interns watch from the gallery, upset with [alex_karev], but [izzie_stevens] is relieved [kevin_davidson] is getting surgery.
A nurse informs [izzie_stevens] that [kevin_davidson] has been identified, and his wife is on her way.
Dr. [derek_shepherd] [derek_shepherd] introduces the wife, [shelley_davidson], to [izzie_stevens] and leaves, asking to be paged if needed.
[izzie_stevens] explains to [shelley_davidson] that [kevin_davidson] might wake up, but if not by morning, they would like to know if [shelley_davidson] has considered organ donation for [kevin_davidson].
[richard_webber] gently shakes [lloyd_mackie]'s shoulder and tells [lloyd_mackie] that [george_omalley] found a liver for him.
[lloyd_mackie] looks at [richard_webber] and then at [george_omalley], trying not to cry as [richard_webber] comforts him.
[george_omalley] leaves.
[alex_karev] rushes into the locker room to find Meredith.
[alex_karev] mentions he smells like open-heart surgery and gets close to Meredith.
Meredith grabs [alex_karev] and pushes him against the lockers, telling [alex_karev] to stay away and that he smells bad.
They both notice Dr. [derek_shepherd] [derek_shepherd].
Meredith returns to her locker, then moves aggressively towards [alex_karev].
Dr. [derek_shepherd] [derek_shepherd] tells [alex_karev] to leave and pushes him out, while [alex_karev] makes a face at Meredith.
Meredith closes her locker and prepares to leave.
Dr. [derek_shepherd] [derek_shepherd] opens the door for Meredith, and she looks at him briefly before walking away.
Meredith arrives home to find [izzie_stevens] and [george_omalley] watching video tapes.
Meredith is angry and asks why [izzie_stevens] and [george_omalley] touched her mother's surgical tapes.
Meredith goes upstairs angrily.
[izzie_stevens] and [george_omalley] look at each other and laugh.
Outside the hospital, Meredith tells [cristina_yang] about her cheerful and helpful roommates.
[cristina_yang] suggests Meredith should kick them out, but Meredith decides she can't do that.
As Meredith and [cristina_yang] enter the hospital, [alex_karev] complains about being assigned to the pit again while [cristina_yang] gets the harvest surgery.
Annoyed with [alex_karev], Meredith and [cristina_yang] jokingly consider becoming lesbians.
Meredith and [cristina_yang] choose the stairs instead of the elevator.
[cristina_yang] talks to [kevin_davidson]'s wife and daughter.
[cristina_yang] reviews the organ donation form with [shelley_davidson].
When [shelley_davidson] starts crying, [cristina_yang] leaves and tells [miranda_bailey] it's too difficult because [cristina_yang] is not good with people.
[miranda_bailey] reminds [cristina_yang] that it's not supposed to be easy and that [kevin_davidson] is a person, not just for organ harvesting.
Remembering this, [cristina_yang] goes back to talk to [shelley_davidson] again.
[george_omalley] examines [lloyd_mackie].
When [lloyd_mackie] flirts with [george_omalley], [george_omalley] awkwardly tries to explain that he is not gay.
[lloyd_mackie] smiles and tells [george_omalley] he never thought [george_omalley] was gay, and [lloyd_mackie] isn't either.
[lloyd_mackie] mentions that dying gives him freedom to be bold without judgment.
[lloyd_mackie] asks [george_omalley] if there was anyone [george_omalley] was attracted to but couldn't have.
After some time, [george_omalley] admits it was Meredith.
During organ harvest preparation, [preston_burke] shares he dislikes harvesting because it ends a life, while [preston_burke] prefers saving them.
[izzie_stevens] quietly tells [kevin_davidson] he did his best and says goodbye.
Meredith and [alex_karev] are working in Trauma.
Meredith notices [viper] sitting in a chair and asks [alex_karev] why [viper] is there and how long [viper] has been waiting.
[alex_karev] replies that [alex_karev] doesn't know because [alex_karev] was busy with other cases.
[viper] starts coughing, and Meredith approaches [viper] worriedly.
As [viper] tries to stand, [viper] collapses unconscious, bleeding from [viper]'s mouth.
Meredith lifts [viper]'s shirt and sees [viper]'s stitches have ripped open, with swelling the size of a small melon.
Meredith places [viper] on a gurney and tries to stop [viper]'s bleeding.
Meredith asks a nurse to inform the OR that Meredith is coming and to contact [miranda_bailey].
They reach the OR.
[miranda_bailey] instructs Meredith to scrub in and sends [alex_karev] back downstairs as a penalty for prioritizing only interesting cases.
[lloyd_mackie] is on the OR table, prepared for anesthesia.
The Chief asks [lloyd_mackie] to count backwards, and [lloyd_mackie] soon falls asleep.
[izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] scrub in while [richard_webber] and [preston_burke] enter.
[richard_webber] mentions [richard_webber] will be next door when needed.
They begin the operation.
The organs are placed in plastic bags and sealed containers.
The liver is put on ice.
[george_omalley] gives it to [richard_webber].
[richard_webber] places it in [lloyd_mackie].
Meanwhile, an alarm starts beeping during the harvest.
The heart is being removed. Everyone prepares to leave, but [izzie_stevens] stays. [cristina_yang] notices and asks why. [izzie_stevens] says she wants to sew [viper] up for [viper]'s family. [cristina_yang] decides to help [izzie_stevens].
Later, [cristina_yang] and [izzie_stevens] meet [shelley_davidson] and inform [shelley_davidson] that [viper] is ready. [cristina_yang] looks thoughtfully at [viper]'s friends, who are also waiting. [miranda_bailey] and Meredith come out to see [viper]'s friends. They ask about [viper]'s condition.
[miranda_bailey] begins shouting, questioning if [viper] is okay. [viper] is not okay at all. [viper] threw himself down a concrete hill at high speed for no reason. People often harm themselves and act recklessly. However, others are trying to live their lives on that hill. Today, someone got hurt because of this behavior.
Meredith interrupts, and [miranda_bailey] calms down, saying she believes [viper] is not fine, then leaves. Meredith awkwardly explains that [miranda_bailey] is tired but assures them that [viper] will recover. In the locker room, Meredith packs her things.
[derek_shepherd] enters and closes the door.
[derek_shepherd] tells Meredith it’s not about the chase or a game; it’s about her hair.
Meredith looks surprised, and [derek_shepherd] adds that it smells nice.
[derek_shepherd] also mentions Meredith's bossiness.
Meredith insists she won't date [derek_shepherd], but he leaves, saying she might change her mind.
[george_omalley] informs [lloyd_mackie] that the surgery went well.
[lloyd_mackie] sighs, realizing [lloyd_mackie] needs to quit smoking, and smiles while holding [george_omalley]'s hand.
Meredith opens her front door to find [izzie_stevens], [cristina_yang], and [george_omalley] eating pizza, drinking beer, and watching a surgical tape.
Everyone pauses to look at Meredith.
[george_omalley] quickly says that [cristina_yang] insisted on watching the tapes.
[cristina_yang] gives [george_omalley] a glare.
Meredith asks about the tape, sits down, and grabs some popcorn.
After watching for a few seconds, they all scream and laugh in shock at what they see.
