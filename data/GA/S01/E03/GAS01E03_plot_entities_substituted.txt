[meredith_grey] is in bed at 4:37 am while it rains.
[isobel_stevens] stands beside [meredith_grey] holding coffee and mentions that [george_omalley]'s room is bigger than [isobel_stevens]'s.
[meredith_grey] gets up, trips, and falls.
[meredith_grey] limps away.
[isobel_stevens] follows, explaining [isobel_stevens] needs more space for her clothes.
[george_omalley] interrupts, saying [george_omalley] was there first, but [isobel_stevens] insists it's [meredith_grey]'s choice.
[george_omalley] points out [george_omalley]'s room is only two inches bigger, but [isobel_stevens] argues [george_omalley] has a larger closet.
[george_omalley] suggests [isobel_stevens] put her clothes elsewhere, but [isobel_stevens] says [meredith_grey]'s mother's boxes fill the space.
[isobel_stevens] and [george_omalley] ask [meredith_grey] if they can store the boxes or unpack items like lamps, paintings, or pillows to make the house cozier.
[isobel_stevens] and [george_omalley] ask [meredith_grey] if they can watch surgical tapes from [meredith_grey]'s mother's boxes.
[meredith_grey] shuts the door on [isobel_stevens] and [george_omalley], then reopens it to take [isobel_stevens]'s coffee before closing it again.
[meredith_grey] leans against the door, holding the coffee.
[miranda_bailey] stands on a street corner, looking confused.
[derek_shepherd] joins [miranda_bailey] and greets her, but [miranda_bailey] tells [derek_shepherd] to be quiet because something important is supposed to happen today, though [miranda_bailey] can't remember what.
[derek_shepherd] starts to cross the road, and [miranda_bailey] gasps, pulling [derek_shepherd] back as several bike riders race past, with two crashing.
At the hospital, [miranda_bailey] complains to the interns about the reckless bike riders.
[alex_karev] asks [george_omalley] if [miranda_bailey] is off her medication, and [george_omalley] is surprised [alex_karev] hasn't heard of the race.
[richard_webber], [preston_burke], and [derek_shepherd] discuss the O.R.
[richard_webber] notes the schedule looks good for an early night.
[miranda_bailey] informs [richard_webber], [preston_burke], and [derek_shepherd] that "Dead baby bike race day" started 20 minutes ago.
[george_omalley] and [meredith_grey] explain that every year, a bar hosts an illegal underground bike race.
[miranda_bailey] complains about the craziness of bike messengers racing against traffic for free tequila shots.
[miranda_bailey] tells the group that the Chief needs help on the OR floor.
Everyone except [meredith_grey] volunteers, and [miranda_bailey] chooses [george_omalley].
[miranda_bailey] warns them not to interact with the ER interns, who [miranda_bailey] thinks are inexperienced.
They need to work quickly, discharging patients and taking bodies to the OR immediately.
[miranda_bailey] also tells them not to fight over patients.
The interns rush to find patients and see injured bike riders everywhere.
[isobel_stevens] and [cristina_yang] hurry to get a patient.
[meredith_grey] notices a man with bicycle spokes in his side.
[alex_karev] and [meredith_grey] both run to him.
Behind a curtain, [alex_karev] and [meredith_grey] argue over the patient.
The patient, named [viper], interrupts and asks [alex_karev] and [meredith_grey] to remove the spokes so he can continue his race.
[meredith_grey] tells [alex_karev] they need to run tests first.
[alex_karev] insists it's a superficial wound and not surgical, then leaves [meredith_grey] to stitch it up.
[cristina_yang], [isobel_stevens], and [derek_shepherd] examine a patient.
[cristina_yang] informs [derek_shepherd] that the patient is an unidentified man in his mid-thirties, hit by a car avoiding a bike.
[cristina_yang] mentions the man's GCS is 3, pupils are fixed and dilated, and atropine was given for a low pulse.
[preston_burke] comments that the bike race has its first victim.
[isobel_stevens] asks [derek_shepherd] if the man will go to the O.R.
[derek_shepherd] instructs [isobel_stevens] to do confirmatory tests and declare the man brain dead if there's no response in six hours.
[richard_webber] is in surgery when [george_omalley] asks if he should join.
[richard_webber] says no and tells [george_omalley] to monitor [george_omalley]'s pre-op and post-op patients, especially a friend named [lloyd_mackie] in room 4451.
[lloyd_mackie] is in bed and lights a cigarette.
[george_omalley] tells [lloyd_mackie] to put it out, warning that smoking is deadly.
[lloyd_mackie] responds that liver cancer will kill him and cigarettes just speed it up.
[george_omalley] insists there is hope because [lloyd_mackie] is at the top of the donor list.
[lloyd_mackie] replies he has been waiting there for eight months.
[isobel_stevens] and [cristina_yang] are with the unidentified man.
[isobel_stevens] is worried the man won't respond, and they have only 5 hours left.
[cristina_yang] explains that if the man doesn't respond, it means he's already dead.
[cristina_yang] adds that she wants the man to hurry up and go into the light so she can take another case.
[isobel_stevens] is shocked and says it's a waste of the man's life.
[cristina_yang] comments it's also a waste of good organs, and [isobel_stevens] realizes [cristina_yang]'s plan.
[meredith_grey] is sewing up [viper].
While [meredith_grey] works, [viper] flirts with her, calling her attractive.
[meredith_grey] ignores [viper]'s refusal and asks him to let her run some tests, promising it would take an hour.
[viper] declines, saying he needs to finish the race.
Before leaving, [meredith_grey] asks [viper] to sign an AMA form.
After signing, [viper] starts to leave but turns back, kisses [meredith_grey], and then departs.
[meredith_grey] shakes her head and begins to strip the bed.
She notices [derek_shepherd] standing outside.
[derek_shepherd] comes in, and [meredith_grey] asks if [derek_shepherd] is jealous.
[derek_shepherd] denies it but mentions he almost died today and wonders how [meredith_grey] would feel if she never got to date him.
[meredith_grey] tells [derek_shepherd] to stop being self-centered and questions if it's just the thrill of the chase for him.
[derek_shepherd] looks surprised, but [meredith_grey] insists it's just a game to him.
Upset, [meredith_grey] leaves the room.
Meanwhile, [miranda_bailey] is performing surgery when [isobel_stevens] and [cristina_yang] enter.
[isobel_stevens] and [cristina_yang] ask [miranda_bailey] if they can harvest their patient's organs.
[miranda_bailey] is surprised and tells [isobel_stevens] and [cristina_yang] to identify the patient, contact his family, and get consent forms.
[isobel_stevens] and [cristina_yang] quickly leave to do this.
[alex_karev] approaches [george_omalley] at a desk.
[george_omalley] explains to [alex_karev] that he is hiding from [lloyd_mackie] because he thinks [lloyd_mackie] might be attracted to him.
[alex_karev] jokingly suggests [george_omalley] should pursue it but then realizes [george_omalley] isn't gay.
[george_omalley] is shocked as [alex_karev] walks away.
[isobel_stevens] and [cristina_yang] arrive at another desk.
[george_omalley] asks [cristina_yang] if she or [meredith_grey] think he is gay.
[cristina_yang] asks if he is, and when he says no, she is surprised.
A woman approaches [isobel_stevens], and [cristina_yang] returns.
[isobel_stevens] gives the woman a hotel key card to pass to the police.
After their conversation, [george_omalley] asks [cristina_yang] if there is a potential organ donor.
[george_omalley] inquires about the blood type and checks it against his chart.
[isobel_stevens] looks at her patient, [kevin_davidson], and talks to him, hoping he can hear.
[isobel_stevens] suggests he might feel a pull towards the light but believes he has a family and encourages him to live.
Suddenly, an alarm sounds, and [kevin_davidson]'s condition worsens as his pulse drops.
[meredith_grey] rushes in, and after some tense moments, they decide to get dopamine and blood for a transfusion.
[george_omalley] examines [lloyd_mackie], who flirts with him.
Meanwhile, [isobel_stevens] and [meredith_grey] go upstairs.
[cristina_yang] meets them and is excited about a potential organ donor.
[isobel_stevens] insists the patient should have surgery to survive.
[cristina_yang] tells [meredith_grey] they need to bypass [miranda_bailey] for their plan.
In the men's bathroom, [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] see [preston_burke].
[meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] ask [preston_burke] to fix [kevin_davidson]'s heart.
[preston_burke] comments on their boldness and tells [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] to leave.
[meredith_grey] seeks advice from [derek_shepherd], who reluctantly suggests going to the Chief instead of [preston_burke].
[isobel_stevens], [meredith_grey], and [cristina_yang] ask [george_omalley] if he wants to join a transplant surgery.
When [richard_webber] inquires about [lloyd_mackie], [george_omalley] mentions a liver is available for [lloyd_mackie], and the Chief listens closely.
[alex_karev] notices the group watching [george_omalley] and [richard_webber].
[preston_burke] walks by, and [richard_webber] informs [preston_burke] about the surgery.
[preston_burke] notices the other interns leaving quickly.
[alex_karev] stays behind and follows [preston_burke] when [preston_burke] leaves.
During open heart surgery, [alex_karev] helps [preston_burke].
The interns watch from the gallery, upset with [alex_karev], but [isobel_stevens] is glad the patient is getting the surgery.
A nurse informs [isobel_stevens] that their [kevin_davidson] has been identified, and [kevin_davidson]'s wife is coming.
[derek_shepherd] introduces the wife, [shelley_davidson], to [isobel_stevens] and leaves, asking [isobel_stevens] to page him if needed.
[isobel_stevens] explains to [shelley_davidson] that her husband might wake up, but if not, they would like to know if [shelley_davidson] has considered organ donation for [kevin_davidson].
[richard_webber] gently shakes [lloyd_mackie]'s shoulder and tells [lloyd_mackie] that [george_omalley] found a liver for him.
[lloyd_mackie] looks at [richard_webber] and then at [george_omalley], trying not to cry as [richard_webber] comforts him.
[george_omalley] leaves. [alex_karev] rushes into the locker room to find [meredith_grey]. [alex_karev] mentions he smells like open-heart surgery and starts nuzzling [meredith_grey]'s hair. [meredith_grey] turns, grabs [alex_karev], and pushes him against the lockers by his shirt. [meredith_grey] tells [alex_karev] to stay away and says he smells bad. They both notice [derek_shepherd]. [meredith_grey] returns to her locker, then moves to confront [alex_karev] again. [derek_shepherd] tells [alex_karev] to leave, pushes him out, and closes the door. [alex_karev] makes a face at [meredith_grey]. [meredith_grey] closes her locker and prepares to leave. [derek_shepherd] opens the door for [meredith_grey], and she looks at [derek_shepherd] briefly before walking away. [meredith_grey] arrives home to find [isobel_stevens] and [george_omalley] watching video tapes. [meredith_grey] is angry and asks why [isobel_stevens] and [george_omalley] touched her mother's surgical tapes. [meredith_grey] goes upstairs angrily while [isobel_stevens] and [george_omalley] share a look and laugh. Outside the hospital, [meredith_grey] tells [cristina_yang] about her cheerful and helpful roommates. [cristina_yang] suggests [meredith_grey] should kick them out, but [meredith_grey] says she can't. As [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] enter the hospital, [alex_karev] complains about being assigned to the pit again while [cristina_yang] gets the harvest surgery. Annoyed with [alex_karev], [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] joke about becoming lesbians.
[cristina_yang] and [meredith_grey] choose the stairs instead of the elevator.
[cristina_yang] speaks with [shelley_davidson] and her daughter.
[cristina_yang] reviews the organ donation form with [shelley_davidson], but when [shelley_davidson] starts crying, [cristina_yang] leaves.
[cristina_yang] tells [miranda_bailey] it's too hard because she's not good with people.
[miranda_bailey] reminds [cristina_yang] that it's not easy, and [kevin_davidson] is more than just organs.
[cristina_yang] goes back to talk to [shelley_davidson] again.
[george_omalley] examines [lloyd_mackie], who flirts with [george_omalley].
[george_omalley] awkwardly tries to explain that he is not gay.
[lloyd_mackie] smiles and tells [george_omalley] he never thought [george_omalley] was gay, and [lloyd_mackie] isn't either.
[lloyd_mackie] says dying is like a free pass to be bold without anyone judging.
[lloyd_mackie] asks [george_omalley] if there was someone he was attracted to but couldn't have.
After some time, [george_omalley] mentions [meredith_grey].
In the organ harvest preparation, [preston_burke] shares that he dislikes harvesting because it ends a life, while he prefers saving them.
[isobel_stevens] quietly tells [kevin_davidson] he did his best and says goodbye.
[meredith_grey] and [alex_karev] are working in Trauma.
[meredith_grey] notices [viper] sitting in a chair and asks [alex_karev] why [viper] is there and how long he's been waiting.
[alex_karev] replies he doesn't know because he was busy with other cases.
[viper] starts coughing, and [meredith_grey] approaches [viper] worriedly.
As [viper] tries to stand, [viper] collapses and blood comes from [viper]'s mouth.
[meredith_grey] lifts [viper]'s shirt and sees [viper]'s stitches have ripped open, with the area swollen to the size of a small melon.
[meredith_grey] places [viper] on a gurney and tries to stop [viper]'s bleeding.
[meredith_grey] asks a nurse to inform the OR that they are coming and to contact [miranda_bailey].
They reach the OR.
[miranda_bailey] instructs [meredith_grey] to scrub in and tells [alex_karev] to return downstairs as a consequence for prioritizing only urgent cases.
[lloyd_mackie] is on the OR table, ready for anesthesia.
The Chief asks [lloyd_mackie] to count backwards, and [lloyd_mackie] quickly falls asleep.
[isobel_stevens] and [cristina_yang] scrub in while [richard_webber] and [preston_burke] enter.
[richard_webber] informs them he will be next door when needed.
They begin the operation.
The organs are placed in plastic bags and sealed containers.
The liver is placed on ice.
[george_omalley] takes the liver and gives it to [richard_webber].
[richard_webber] places the liver in [lloyd_mackie].
Back at the harvest, an alarm starts beeping.
The heart is being removed.
Everyone prepares to leave, but [isobel_stevens] stays.
[cristina_yang] looks at [isobel_stevens], who explains she wants to sew the patient up for his family.
[cristina_yang] decides to help [isobel_stevens].
Later, [cristina_yang] and [isobel_stevens] meet [shelley_davidson] and tell her the patient is ready.
[cristina_yang] looks thoughtfully at [viper]'s friends, who are also waiting.
[miranda_bailey] and [meredith_grey] come out to see [viper]'s friends.
They ask if [viper] is okay.
[miranda_bailey] starts shouting, asking if [viper] is okay.
[viper] is not okay at all.
[viper] threw himself down a concrete hill at high speed without a good reason.
People often harm themselves and act recklessly, but there are others on that hill—walking, driving, living their lives.
Today, someone got hurt because of this reckless behavior.
[meredith_grey] interrupts, and [miranda_bailey] calms down, saying she believes [viper] is not fine, then leaves.
[meredith_grey] awkwardly explains that [miranda_bailey] is tired but assures them [viper] will be okay.
In the locker room, [meredith_grey] packs her things.
[derek_shepherd] enters, closes the door, and tells [meredith_grey] it's not about the chase or a game; it's her hair.
[meredith_grey] looks surprised, and [derek_shepherd] adds that it smells nice and mentions her bossiness.
[meredith_grey] insists she won't go out with [derek_shepherd], but he leaves, saying she'll change her mind.
[george_omalley] informs [lloyd_mackie] that the surgery was successful.
[lloyd_mackie] sighs, realizing [lloyd_mackie] needs to quit smoking, and then smiles while holding [george_omalley]'s hand.
[meredith_grey] enters [meredith_grey]'s house.
[isobel_stevens], [cristina_yang], and [george_omalley] are eating pizza, drinking beer, and watching a surgical tape.
[isobel_stevens], [cristina_yang], and [george_omalley] pause to look at [meredith_grey].
[george_omalley] quickly says [cristina_yang] insisted on watching the tapes.
[cristina_yang] gives [george_omalley] a glare.
[meredith_grey] inquires about the tape, sits down, and takes some popcorn.
After watching for a few seconds, [meredith_grey], [isobel_stevens], [cristina_yang], and [george_omalley] all react with screams and laughter, surprised by the tape.
