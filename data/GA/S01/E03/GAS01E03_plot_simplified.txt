Meredith is in bed.
It's 4:37 am and raining.
Izzie stands beside Meredith's bed holding coffee.
Izzie says George's bedroom is bigger than hers.
Meredith gets up but trips and falls.
She limps away.
Izzie follows her and explains she needs more space for her clothes.
George interrupts, saying he got there first.
Izzie insists it's Meredith's decision.
George says his room is only two inches bigger.
Izzie argues he has a bigger closet.
George suggests Izzie put her clothes elsewhere.
Izzie says everywhere is filled with Meredith's mother's boxes.
They ask Meredith if they can store the boxes or unpack some items like lamps, paintings, or pillows to make the house cozier.
Izzie and George ask to watch surgical tapes from Meredith's mother's boxes.
Meredith slams the door in their faces.
She re-opens it, takes Izzie's coffee, and shuts the door again.
Meredith leans against the door, holding the coffee.
Bailey stands on a street corner, looking confused.
Shepherd joins her and says hello.
Bailey tells him to be quiet because something important is happening today, but she can't remember what.
Derek starts to cross the road.
Bailey gasps and grabs him as several bike riders race past, and two crash.
At the hospital, Bailey complains to the interns about the bikers, saying they're just fools killing themselves.
Alex asks George if Bailey is off her medication.
George is surprised he never heard of the race.
Webber, Burke, and Shepherd stand in front of the O.R.
Schedule board.
They note it's well-organized, so they might finish early.
Bailey tells them "Dead baby bike race day" started 20 minutes ago.
George and Meredith explain that every year a bar holds an illegal underground bike race.
Bailey complains again, saying it's crazy that bike messengers race against traffic for free tequila shots.
Bailey says she needs someone on the OR floor.
The Chief needs help.
Everyone raises their hand except Meredith.
Bailey chooses George.
Bailey tells the others not to talk to the ER interns.
She says they don't know much.
They must sew quickly, discharge quickly, and take bodies to the OR immediately.
She warns them not to fight over patients.
The interns run and push for position.
They see injured bike riders everywhere.
Izzie and Cristina hurry to get a patient.
Meredith sees a man with bicycle spokes in his side.
Alex and Meredith rush to him.
Behind a curtain, Alex and Meredith argue over the patient.
The patient, Viper, pulls back the curtain.
He asks if they can remove the spokes so he can win his race.
Meredith tells Alex they need to run tests first.
Alex insists it's a superficial wound, not surgical.
He leaves Meredith to sew it up.
Cristina, Izzie, and Derek stand over a patient.
Cristina reports to Derek about the patient: an unidentified man in his mid-thirties, hit by a car avoiding a bike.
His GCS is 3, pupils are fixed and dilated, and atropine was given for a low pulse.
Burke mentions the bike race claimed its first victim.
Izzie asks if the patient will go to the O.R.

If there's no response in six hours, they should declare him brain dead.
Webber is in surgery.
George asks if he should scrub in.
Webber says no and tells George to monitor his pre-op and post-op patients.
Webber asks George to pay special attention to his friend, Lloyd Mackie, in room 4451.
Lloyd is in bed and lights a cigarette.
George tells him to put it out because smoking kills.
Lloyd replies that liver cancer will kill him, and cigarettes just speed it up.
George insists there is hope because Lloyd is at the top of the donor list.
Lloyd says he has been at the top for eight months.
Izzie and Cristina are with their patient.
Izzie worries he won't respond, and they have only 5 hours left.
Cristina says if he doesn't respond, he's already dead.
Cristina wants him to hurry and go into the light so she can get another case.
Izzie looks shocked and says it's a waste of his life.
Cristina adds it's a waste of good organs too, and Izzie realizes her plan.
Meredith sews up Viper, and he flirts with her, calling her a "rocking babe."
She ignores his refusal and asks to do some tests, promising to finish in an hour.
He insists he must finish the race.
Before leaving, she asks him to sign an AMA form.
He signs and turns to leave but kisses Meredith.
Viper leaves, and Meredith shakes her head and starts stripping the bed.
She sees Derek outside.
Derek enters, and Meredith asks if he's jealous.
He says he's not but mentions he almost died today and wonders how she'd feel if they never went out.
She tells him to get over himself and asks if it's just the thrill of the chase for him.
Derek looks surprised.
Meredith accuses him of playing a game and storms out angrily.
Bailey is performing surgery when Izzie and Cristina enter.
They ask if they can harvest their patient's organs.

Izzie and Cristina approach the other desk.
George asks Cristina if she or Meredith think he is gay.
Cristina asks him if he is.
When he says no, she is surprised.
A woman approaches Izzie.
Cristina returns to the scene.
Izzie gives the woman a hotel key card to give to the police.
After they finish talking, George asks if they have a potential organ donor.
He inquires about the blood type and checks his chart.
Izzie talks to her John Doe.
She says, "I know you probably can't hear me.
You're feeling a push to go towards the light.
Sharing your organs is great, but I think you have a family.
I can feel it.
It'd be great if you could get better.
Just live.
Can you try that for me?"
Suddenly, an alarm sounds.
John Doe begins to crash, and his pulse drops.
Meredith runs in.
After a few tense moments, they decide to get dopamine and blood to transfuse him.
George examines Mackie.
Mackie flirts with George.
Izzie and Meredith go up some stairs.
Cristina meets them.
She is excited about their patient becoming an organ donor.
Izzie insists the patient should have surgery to live.
Cristina tells Meredith they need to go above Bailey for their plan.
In the men's bathroom, Meredith and Cristina see Burke.
They ask him to repair John Doe's heart.
Burke notes they like to cross the line.
He tells them to either show a penis or leave.

Izzie is happy their patient is getting surgery.
A nurse enters and tells Izzie their John Doe has been identified.
His wife is coming.
Derek introduces the wife, Shelley Davidson, to Izzie.
Derek leaves and tells them to page him if needed.
Izzie tells Shelley her husband might wake up.
If he doesn't change by morning, they ask if she's considered organ donation for Kevin.
Webber shakes Mackie's shoulder lightly.
He tells Mackie that George found him a liver.
Mackie looks at Webber, then at George.
His face starts to break up.
He looks away, trying not to cry.
Webber pats his shoulder.
George leaves.
Alex enters the locker room to find Meredith.
He tells her he smells like open-heart surgery and nuzzles her hair.

She tells him to stay away and that he smells bad.
They both see Derek.
Meredith returns to her locker.
She moves to confront Alex again.

Meredith arrives home.
Izzie and George are watching video tapes.
Meredith is angry and asks why they touched her mother's surgical tapes.
She storms upstairs.
Izzie and George exchange looks and giggle.
Outside the hospital, Meredith talks to Cristina.
She explains how perky and helpful her roommates are.
Cristina suggests Meredith should kick them out.
Meredith decides she can't do that.
Alex comes up behind them as they enter the hospital.
He complains about being stuck in the pit again.
Cristina is getting the harvest surgery.
Annoyed with Alex, they jokingly consider becoming lesbians.
The elevator dings, but they choose the stairs.
Cristina talks to Kevin's wife and little girl.
She goes over the organ donation form with Shelley.
When Shelley gets teary, Cristina leaves the room.
She explains to Bailey that she isn't a people person and it's too hard.
Bailey tells her it won't be easy, but the man is a person, not just for organ harvesting.
Remembering this, Cristina re-enters the room.
She talks with Shelley again.
George examines Mackie.
Mackie begins to flirt with him again.
George awkwardly tries to tell Mackie he is not gay.
Mackie smiles and says he never thought George was gay, and he isn't either.
He tells George that dying is like a free pass.
He can be bold, and no one can say anything.
Mackie asks George if there was anyone he liked but couldn't have.
After a while, George says, "Meredith."
In the organ harvest preparation, Burke talks about not liking harvesting because he saves lives, and harvesting ends one.
Izzie quietly tells Kevin he did his best and says goodbye.
Meredith and Alex work in Trauma.
Meredith sees Viper waiting in a chair.
She asks Alex why Viper is there and how long he's been waiting.
Alex says he doesn't know because he was busy with real cases.
Viper starts coughing, and Meredith walks towards him worriedly.
He tries to stand, and she runs to him, but he falls unconscious.
Blood comes out of his mouth.
She lifts his shirt and sees his stitches have ripped open.
The area around them is swollen to the size of a small melon.
Meredith puts Viper on a gurney.
She climbs on top to hold his wound closed.
She asks a nurse to inform the OR that she's coming and to page Bailey.
They arrive at the OR.

Webber puts the liver in Mackie.
Meanwhile, an alarm starts beeping.
The heart is being removed.
Everyone prepares to leave.
Izzie stays behind.
Cristina looks back at Izzie.
Izzie says she wants to sew him up for his family.
Cristina decides to help her.
Later, Cristina and Izzie meet Shelley.
They tell her he is ready.
Cristina looks thoughtfully at Viper's friends.
They are also waiting.
Bailey and Meredith walk out to see them.
They ask if he's okay.
Bailey starts shouting, asking if he's okay.
No, he is not okay at all.
He threw himself down a concrete hill at full speed for no reason.
People do risky things like piercing and smoking, acting like their bodies can't get hurt.
If you want to risk your life on a concrete hill, that's your choice.
But remember, others are walking, driving, and living their lives there too.
Today, someone got hurt because of reckless behavior.
Meredith interrupts, and Bailey calms down, saying she thinks he is not fine, then leaves angrily.
Meredith awkwardly explains that Bailey is tired but assures them Viper will be okay.
In the locker room, Meredith packs her things.
Derek enters and closes the door.
He tells her it's not about the chase or a game; it's her hair.

He also mentions her bossiness.
She tells him she still won't go out with him.
He leaves, saying, "You say that now."
George tells Mackie the surgery went well.
Mackie sighs and realizes he must quit smoking.
He smiles and holds George's hand.

Inside, Izzie, Cristina, and George are eating pizza and drinking beer.
They are watching a surgical tape.
Everyone stops to look at Meredith.
George quickly says Cristina made them watch the tapes.
Cristina glares at him.
Meredith asks what they are watching.
She sits down and grabs some popcorn.
They watch for a few seconds.
Suddenly, they all recoil, screaming and laughing in shock at the tape.
