Meredith is in bed at 4:37 am while it rains.
Izzie stands beside her with coffee, mentioning that George's room is bigger than hers.
Meredith gets up, trips, and falls.
She limps away.
Izzie follows, explaining she needs more space for her clothes.
George interrupts, saying he was there first, but Izzie insists it's Meredith's decision.
George argues his room is only slightly bigger, but Izzie points out his larger closet.
George suggests Izzie store her clothes elsewhere, but she says Meredith's mother's boxes fill the space.
They ask Meredith if they can store the boxes or unpack items like lamps, paintings, or pillows to make the house cozier.
Izzie and George ask Meredith if they can watch surgical tapes from her mother's boxes.
Meredith shuts the door on them, then reopens it to take Izzie's coffee before closing it again.
She leans against the door, holding the coffee.
Bailey stands on a street corner, looking confused.
Shepherd joins her and greets her, but she tells him to be quiet because something important is happening today, though she can't remember what.
Derek starts to cross the road, and Bailey gasps, pulling him back as several bike riders race past, with two crashing.
At the hospital, Bailey complains to the interns about the reckless bike riders.
Alex asks George if Bailey is off her medication, and George is surprised Alex hasn't heard of the race.
Webber, Burke, and Shepherd look at the O.R.
Schedule board, noting it's well-organized, so they might finish early.
Bailey informs them that "Dead baby bike race day" started 20 minutes ago.
George and Meredith explain that every year, a bar hosts an illegal underground bike race.
Bailey complains again about the bike messengers racing against traffic for free tequila shots.
Bailey tells the interns that the Chief needs help on the OR floor.
Everyone except Meredith volunteers, and Bailey chooses George.
She warns them not to interact with the ER interns, who she thinks are inexperienced.
They need to work quickly, discharging patients and moving bodies to the OR immediately.
She also tells them not to fight over patients.
The interns rush to find positions and see injured bike riders everywhere.
Izzie and Cristina hurry to get a patient.
Meredith notices a man with bicycle spokes in his side.
Alex and Meredith both run to him.
Behind a curtain, Alex and Meredith argue over the patient.
The patient, named Viper, interrupts and asks them to remove the spokes so he can continue his race.
Meredith tells Alex they need to run tests first.
Alex insists it's a superficial wound and not surgical, then leaves Meredith to stitch it up.
Cristina, Izzie, and Derek examine a patient.
Cristina informs Derek that the patient is an unidentified man in his mid-thirties, hit by a car avoiding a bike.
She describes his condition as having a GCS of 3, fixed and dilated pupils, and atropine given for a low pulse.
Burke mentions that the bike race has claimed its first victim.
Izzie asks if the patient will go to the O.R.
Derek instructs her to do confirmatory tests and says if there is no response in six hours, they should declare him brain dead.
Webber is in surgery when George asks if he should join.
Webber tells him no and instructs George to monitor his pre-op and post-op patients.
He emphasizes paying special attention to a friend named Lloyd Mackie in room 4451.
Lloyd is in bed and lights a cigarette.
George tells him to put it out, saying smoking is deadly.
Lloyd responds that liver cancer will kill him anyway, and cigarettes just speed it up.
George insists there is hope because Lloyd is at the top of the donor list.
Lloyd replies he has been waiting there for eight months.
Izzie and Cristina are with their patient.
Izzie is worried he won't respond, and they have only 5 hours left.
Cristina explains that if he doesn't respond, it means he's already dead.
Cristina adds she wants him to hurry up and go into the light so she can take another case.
Izzie is shocked and says it's a waste of his life.
Cristina mentions it's also a waste of good organs, and Izzie realizes her plan.
Meredith is sewing up Viper.
While she works, he flirts with her, calling her attractive.
She ignores his refusal and asks him to let her run some tests, promising it would only take an hour.
He declines, saying he needs to finish the race.
Before he leaves, she asks him to sign an AMA form.
After signing, he starts to leave but turns back, kisses Meredith, and then departs.
Meredith shakes her head and begins to strip the bed.
She notices Derek standing outside.
Derek comes in, and Meredith asks if he's jealous.
He denies it but mentions he almost died today and wonders how she'd feel if she never got to date him.
She tells him to stop being self-centered and questions if he's just interested in the chase.
Derek seems surprised, but Meredith insists it's just a game for him.
Upset, she leaves the room.
Meanwhile, Bailey is performing surgery when Izzie and Cristina enter.
They ask Bailey if they can take their patient's organs.
Bailey, surprised, tells them to identify the patient, contact the family, and get consent forms.
Izzie and Cristina quickly leave to do this.
Alex approaches George at a desk.
George explains he is hiding from Lloyd because he thinks Lloyd might be attracted to him.
Alex suggests he should pursue it but then realizes George isn't gay.
George is shocked as Alex walks away.
Izzie and Cristina arrive at another desk.
George asks Cristina if she or Meredith think he is gay.
Cristina asks if he is, and when he says no, she is surprised.
A woman approaches Izzie, and Cristina returns.
Izzie gives her a hotel key card to pass to the police.
After their conversation, George asks if they have a potential organ donor.
He inquires about the blood type and checks his chart.
Izzie looks at her patient, John Doe, and tells him she believes he has a family.
She hopes he will recover and live.
Suddenly, an alarm sounds, and his condition worsens as his pulse drops.
Meredith rushes in, and they decide to get dopamine and blood for a transfusion.
George examines Mackie, who flirts with him.
Izzie and Meredith go up some stairs.

Izzie insists the patient should have surgery to survive.
Cristina tells Meredith they need to go above Bailey for their plan.
In the men's bathroom, Meredith and Cristina see Burke.
They ask him to repair John Doe's heart.
Burke notes they often cross the line and tells them to leave.
Meredith asks Derek for advice.
He hesitantly suggests going over Burke's head to the Chief.
Izzie, Meredith, and Cristina ask George if he wants to join a transplant surgery.

Alex notices the others watching George and Webber.
Burke walks by, and Webber stops him to discuss the surgery.
Burke notices the other interns quickly leaving.
Alex stays behind and follows Burke when he turns to go.
During the open-heart surgery, Alex helps Burke.
The interns watch from the gallery, upset with Alex, but Izzie is relieved the patient is getting surgery.
A nurse informs Izzie that their John Doe has been identified, and his wife is on her way.
Derek introduces the wife, Shelley Davidson, to Izzie and leaves, asking to be paged if needed.
Izzie explains to Shelley that her husband might wake up, but if not by morning, they would like to know if she has considered organ donation for Kevin.
Webber gently shakes Mackie's shoulder and tells him George found a liver for him.
Mackie looks at Webber and then at George, trying not to cry as Webber comforts him.
George leaves.
Alex rushes into the locker room to find Meredith.
He mentions he smells like open-heart surgery and gets close to her.
Meredith grabs him and pushes him against the lockers, telling him to stay away and that he smells bad.
They both notice Derek.
Meredith returns to her locker, then moves aggressively towards Alex.
Derek tells Alex to leave and pushes him out, while Alex makes a face at Meredith.
She closes her locker and prepares to leave.
Derek opens the door for her, and she looks at him briefly before walking away.

She is angry and asks why they touched her mother's surgical tapes.
She goes upstairs angrily.
Izzie and George look at each other and laugh.
Outside the hospital, Meredith tells Cristina about her cheerful and helpful roommates.
Cristina suggests she should kick them out, but Meredith decides she can't do that.
As they enter the hospital, Alex complains about being assigned to the pit again while Cristina gets the harvest surgery.
Annoyed with Alex, they jokingly consider becoming lesbians.
They choose the stairs instead of the elevator.
Cristina talks to Kevin's wife and daughter.
She reviews the organ donation form with Shelley.
When Shelley starts crying, Cristina leaves and tells Bailey it's too difficult because she's not good with people.
Bailey reminds her that it's not supposed to be easy and that the man is a person, not just for organ harvesting.
Remembering this, Cristina goes back to talk to Shelley again.
George examines Mackie.
When Mackie flirts with him, George awkwardly tries to explain that he is not gay.
Mackie smiles and tells George he never thought George was gay, and he isn't either.
He mentions that dying gives him freedom to be bold without judgment.
Mackie asks George if there was anyone he was attracted to but couldn't have.
After some time, George admits it was Meredith.
During organ harvest preparation, Burke shares he dislikes harvesting because it ends a life, while he prefers saving them.
Izzie quietly tells Kevin he did his best and says goodbye.
Meredith and Alex are working in Trauma.
Meredith notices Viper sitting in a chair and asks Alex why he's there and how long he's been waiting.
Alex replies he doesn't know because he was busy with other cases.
Viper starts coughing, and Meredith approaches him worriedly.
As he tries to stand, he collapses unconscious, bleeding from his mouth.
Meredith lifts his shirt and sees his stitches have ripped open, with swelling the size of a small melon.
Meredith places Viper on a gurney and tries to stop his bleeding.
She asks a nurse to inform the OR that she is coming and to contact Bailey.
They reach the OR.
Bailey instructs Meredith to scrub in and sends Alex back downstairs as a penalty for prioritizing only interesting cases.
Mackie is on the OR table, prepared for anesthesia.
The Chief asks him to count backwards, and he soon falls asleep.
Izzie and Cristina scrub in while Webber and Burke enter.

The heart is being removed.
Everyone prepares to leave, but Izzie stays.
Cristina notices and asks why.
Izzie says she wants to sew him up for his family.
Cristina decides to help her.
Later, Cristina and Izzie meet Shelley and inform her he is ready.
Cristina looks thoughtfully at Viper's friends, who are also waiting.
Bailey and Meredith come out to see them.
They ask about his condition.
Bailey begins shouting, questioning if he is okay.
He is not okay at all.
He threw himself down a concrete hill at high speed for no reason.
People often harm themselves and act recklessly.
However, others are trying to live their lives on that hill.
Today, someone got hurt because of this behavior.
Meredith interrupts, and Bailey calms down, saying she believes he is not fine, then leaves.
Meredith awkwardly explains that Bailey is tired but assures them that Viper will recover.
In the locker room, Meredith packs her things.
Derek enters and closes the door.
He tells her it’s not about the chase or a game; it’s about her hair.
Meredith looks surprised, and he adds that it smells nice.
He also mentions her bossiness.
She insists she won't date him, but he leaves, saying she might change her mind.
George informs Mackie that the surgery went well.
