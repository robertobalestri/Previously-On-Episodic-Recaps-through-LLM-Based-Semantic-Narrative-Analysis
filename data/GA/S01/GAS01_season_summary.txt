Meredith Grey began her story by reflecting on the pressures of becoming a surgeon, especially in the shadow of her mother, Ellis Grey's, celebrated career. After waking up beside Derek Shepherd, a man she had spent the night with, Meredith felt embarrassed and hurriedly urged Derek to leave, anxious about being late for her first day as a surgical intern. Derek tried to prolong their flirtation, but Meredith insisted he go, and they awkwardly exchanged names before she rushed out.

Arriving at Seattle Grace Hospital, Meredith joined the other new interns—Cristina Yang, George O'Malley, and Izzie Stevens—for orientation. Meredith's internal monologue revealed her anxiety about the difficult road ahead, knowing that only a few interns would survive the demanding residency. Dr. Richard Webber, the Chief of Surgery, addressed the incoming class, warning them that residency would be both the best and worst time of their lives, and that not everyone would be able to withstand the pressure. Cristina remarked on the low number of women among the interns, while George mentioned that one intern was rumored to be a model.

The interns were introduced to Dr. Miranda Bailey, who was known for her strictness and was nicknamed "the Nazi." Bailey laid out her five rules for survival: no sucking up, answer every page at a run, don't wake her unless a patient is dying, don't let a dying patient be dead when she arrives, and always move when she moves. She made it clear that the interns were at the very bottom of the hospital hierarchy and assigned George to run the code team, Meredith to handle the trauma pager, Cristina to deliver labs, and Izzie to sutures, emphasizing that their job was to keep her happy by doing the grunt work.

The group was immediately thrust into action when a 15-year-old patient named Katie Bryce was brought in with seizures. Bailey assigned Cristina to run labs, George to patient workups, Meredith to take Katie for a CT scan, and Izzie to perform rectal exams on patients. As the interns struggled with their new responsibilities, Meredith and Cristina discussed Katie's puzzling case, noting that her labs were clear and there was no obvious cause for her seizures. George hoped to be chosen for a surgical procedure, since it was rumored that the best intern would get the opportunity on the first shift. Katie, frustrated about missing her beauty pageant, was sarcastic with the interns. Izzie, overwhelmed by the number of rectal exams, complained that Bailey hated her.

The interns gossiped about Meredith's background, revealing that her mother was the renowned surgeon Ellis Grey. Cristina envied Meredith's background, while Izzie admired Ellis's accomplishments. Alex Karev, another intern, joined the group, making crude jokes and antagonizing Izzie by calling her a nurse.

Bailey surprised everyone by announcing that George had been chosen to scrub in for an appendectomy. Cristina and Alex doubted George's abilities and even bet on his failure. In the operating room, George started out well but panicked and made a mistake, causing complications. Dr. Preston Burke, the attending surgeon, took over, and George was left humiliated. The other interns began calling him "007," implying he had a "license to kill" after his near-fatal error.

Katie's condition deteriorated, and the interns scrambled to manage her worsening seizures. Meredith and Cristina worked together to try to diagnose her, reviewing her medical history and ruling out various causes. During this time, Meredith confided in Cristina that she had slept with Dr. Shepherd, who turned out to be Derek, the attending neurosurgeon. Cristina, however, was more interested in solving Katie's case than Meredith's personal life.

Derek gathered the interns and asked for their help in diagnosing Katie, promising that whoever found the answer would assist in her surgery. Meredith and Cristina collaborated and eventually realized that Katie's seizures could be the result of a subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a minor fall during a rhythmic gymnastics rehearsal. They presented their findings to Derek, who confirmed the diagnosis and prepared for surgery. Derek chose Meredith to scrub in, explaining that she had earned the opportunity by helping save Katie's life, not because of their personal connection.

Meanwhile, George was devastated after he had promised a patient's family that their loved one would be fine, only for the patient to die during surgery. Bailey reprimanded George, warning him never to promise a good outcome. Izzie and Cristina argued about the cutthroat nature of the program, with Cristina accusing Izzie of not earning her opportunities.

Meredith decided not to sell her mother's house and planned to find roommates. She visited her mother, Ellis Grey, who was suffering from memory loss and did not recognize Meredith as her daughter. Meredith gently reminded Ellis that she had been a surgeon.

As the first shift ended, Meredith reflected on the challenges and pressures of being a surgeon, admitting that despite the reasons to quit, she loved the work. Derek, Cristina, Izzie, Alex, and George all struggled with the demands of their first day, but they survived. Meredith and Derek shared a brief, professional exchange, agreeing not to make things awkward between them. Meredith concluded that, despite everything, she was staying in the game.

As the group prepared for their first grueling 48-hour shift, Bailey reinforced her expectations, and the interns eagerly sought surgical opportunities but quickly learned that Bailey expected them to focus on menial tasks. Izzie and Alex competed to finish their patient rounds faster, while George grew frustrated by the emotional toll of running the code team, where most patients could not be revived.

A trauma case soon arrived: a 25-year-old rape victim named Allison. Alex and Cristina led the response, and the interns discovered that Allison had fought back fiercely, biting off her attacker's penis, which Meredith identified in a specimen jar. The rape kit was negative, confirming Allison had successfully defended herself. The brutality of the case left the interns shaken.

Elsewhere, Izzie struggled to communicate with a Chinese-speaking patient, Mrs. Liu, and sought help from Cristina, who revealed she was Korean and did not speak Chinese. The language barrier complicated Mrs. Liu's care, and Mrs. Liu's fear of being reported as undocumented made her reluctant to enter the hospital. Meredith, Izzie, and George promised not to report her and treated her wound outside, with Meredith giving her a card to return for follow-up care.

Tensions among the hospital's attendings surfaced when Burke confronted Webber about bringing Derek Shepherd to Seattle Grace, feeling threatened about his own chances of becoming chief of surgery. Webber criticized Burke for only doing what was necessary and challenged him to earn the position.

During her rounds, Meredith noticed a baby in the pediatric ward with a heart murmur and tried to get Burke to check on him. Burke refused without a consult from Pediatrics, citing hospital rules. Meredith later went behind the pediatrician's back to alert the baby's parents, leading to a confrontation between services. Burke ultimately took over the case, ordered tests, and confirmed a congenital heart defect, scheduling surgery for the next day. He sternly warned Meredith never to undermine another doctor again.

Meanwhile, the police searched for Allison's attacker, knowing he would eventually need medical attention. When the rapist was brought into the hospital, severely injured, the surgical team determined that reattaching his penis was impossible due to the nature of the injury. Bailey delivered the news that he would be incontinent and impotent for life.

The episode also highlighted the loneliness of patients like Allison, who had no family in Seattle. The interns reflected on their own support systems and the importance of having people who care. Izzie and George bonded over the difficulties of their day, with Izzie confessing to kissing another doctor, Eric, in the elevator, and the two joked about the absurdity of their lives as interns.

At the end of the episode, Meredith decided to let George and Izzie move in with her, breaking her own rule about keeping boundaries. The interns celebrated, and Cristina teased Meredith about becoming soft. Meredith reflected on the importance and limitations of boundaries, realizing that while they can protect, they can also isolate. She acknowledged that sometimes, crossing lines is necessary for growth and connection. The episode closed with Meredith and Derek sharing a quiet moment, the tension and attraction between them unresolved, as Meredith contemplated the risks and rewards of crossing personal and professional boundaries.

Dr. Meredith Grey began the next day reflecting on the competitive world of surgical residents, who spent nearly all their time together on the hospital's surgical unit. At Meredith's house, Izzie Stevens and George O'Malley argued over who deserved the bigger bedroom, with Izzie insisting her extensive wardrobe required more space and George countering that he had arrived first. Their bickering shifted to the clutter left by Ellis Grey, prompting Izzie to suggest they unpack and make the house feel like home. While sorting through boxes, Izzie found tapes of Ellis performing surgeries and proposed watching them, but Meredith hesitated, uncomfortable with the idea.

At the hospital, Dr. Miranda Bailey reminded the interns of the strict hierarchy, warning them not to fight over patients or associate with ER interns. The day coincided with the annual “Dead Baby Bike Race,” an illegal event notorious for causing a surge of traumatic injuries. The interns—Cristina Yang, Alex Karev, Izzie Stevens, George O'Malley, and Meredith Grey—discussed the absurdity of the race and the reckless participants, while Cristina and Alex vied for the most interesting trauma cases.

A major trauma soon arrived: a John Doe pedestrian who had been struck by a car avoiding the bike race. Dr. Derek Shepherd assessed the patient and determined he was likely brain dead, ordering tests to confirm. Izzie struggled with the prospect of declaring the patient dead, holding out hope for a miracle, while George explained the importance of following protocol to ensure the patient was truly gone before calling time of death.

Meanwhile, George was assigned by Dr. Preston Burke to monitor his friend Lloyd Mackey, a liver cancer patient at the top of the transplant list. Mackey, cynical about his chances, joked with George, who tried to encourage him despite the grim prognosis.

The interns noticed clues about the John Doe: new sneakers, a sewn shirt, and a hotel key card, suggesting he had a family. They contacted the police, hoping to identify him before the six-hour window for brain death confirmation closed. Izzie, Meredith, and Cristina debated the ethics of keeping him alive for organ donation. Izzie insisted on respecting his right to every minute of life, while Cristina focused on the value his organs could bring to other patients.

Izzie tried to connect with the John Doe, speaking to him and urging him to fight for life. When he began to crash before the six-hour mark, Cristina led the interns in intervening with dopamine and a blood transfusion to keep him viable as a potential organ donor. They discovered he had a traumatic aortic injury that required surgery to preserve his organs. The interns appealed to Dr. Burke to operate, but he refused, so they approached Chief Richard Webber, using Mackey's urgent need for a liver as leverage.

Chief Webber authorized the surgery, and Dr. Burke performed the aortic repair with the interns assisting. The police soon identified the John Doe as Kevin Davidson, and his wife arrived at the hospital. Izzie gently explained the situation to Mrs. Davidson and discussed the possibility of organ donation. The organ procurement coordinator guided Mrs. Davidson through the consent process, including the donation of corneas and skin, which was emotionally taxing for the family.

Cristina admitted her discomfort with dealing with grieving families and struggled with the emotional side of medicine. Meredith reminded Cristina to see Kevin as a person, not just a source of organs. As the team prepared for the organ harvest, Kevin's friends and family gathered to say their goodbyes.

During this time, George and Mackey shared a moment of camaraderie. Mackey joked about taking George out after his transplant and explained that his boldness came from having nothing left to lose. He also asked George about his unspoken feelings for Meredith.

Elsewhere, the interns treated Viper, a frequent bike race patient, and rushed him to surgery. Alex Karev tried to impress Dr. Bailey but was reprimanded for showing off. Meredith, frustrated with Alex's attitude, told him to stay out of her way.

Later, Meredith confided in Cristina about the chaos at home caused by her roommates. Cristina suggested kicking them out, but Meredith admitted she had invited them to move in. They joked about repressing their feelings and the challenges of living together.

The day ended with the organ harvest for Kevin Davidson, as his loved ones grieved. Dr. Bailey lectured the bike racers about the consequences of their reckless actions. Viper survived his surgery, and his friends expressed their gratitude to the doctors.

In the final moments, Derek Shepherd told Meredith that his interest in her was genuine and not just about the thrill of pursuit, but Meredith stood firm in her refusal to date him. Chief Webber reported that Mackey's surgery had gone smoothly, and Mackey joked about needing to quit smoking.

Meredith reflected that true victories in medicine were measured by lives saved, not by competition. That evening, the interns gathered at Meredith's house and watched one of Ellis Grey's surgical tapes together, sharing a rare moment of camaraderie and relief after a challenging day.

Meredith Grey began the next day reflecting on the complexities of intimacy, considering how it is both craved and feared, and how living with relatives, romantic partners, or roommates can make life complicated. Early in the morning, Izzie Stevens asked if someone was using her toothbrush, highlighting the awkwardness of their shared living situation. In the kitchen, Izzie greeted a cat while George O'Malley complained about the lack of privacy, referencing how the women walked around in their underwear while he was naked in the shower. Izzie asked George to buy tampons, but he refused, insisting he would not buy “girl products.” Meredith added tampons to the shopping list and reminded George it was his turn to shop, while Izzie teased him by flaunting her underwear.

At the hospital, Dr. Miranda Bailey reminded the interns, including Meredith, Izzie, George, Cristina Yang, and Alex Karev, to be polite and considerate with patients during pre-rounds, emphasizing that making patients comfortable was crucial for gathering information. Dr. Bailey warned that if the interns made her look bad, they would be punished, and ordered them to complete pre-rounds by 5:30 a.m.

Alex greeted Izzie with a mocking “Dr. Model,” referencing her past as a lingerie model. Izzie retorted, and Cristina complained about her previous day's assignments, hoping for better patients. The interns discussed their early arrival times, with Cristina boasting about being there at 4 a.m. Alex implied that Cristina was only ambitious because she was not involved with an attending, a dig at Meredith's rumored relationship with Dr. Derek Shepherd. Meredith denied any inappropriate relationship.

Dr. Shepherd arrived early and offered to buy Meredith breakfast, but she declined, saying she had already eaten. Cristina, overhearing, made sarcastic remarks about Meredith's breakfast habits and insisted on maintaining professionalism, not wanting to be seen with Meredith in the hospital due to the rumors.

Cristina met Elizabeth Fallon, a former scrub nurse now admitted with pancreatic cancer. Fallon recognized Cristina's ambition and called her out for trying to secure a spot in her surgery, insisting on being called “Nurse Fallon” and calling Cristina “Christina.” Cristina then checked on Mr. Humphrey, who was resistant to being examined by Izzie after recognizing her from a lingerie ad and demanded another doctor, making Izzie uncomfortable.

Back at the house, the roommates debated setting rules about nudity and boundaries. Cristina asked George if he had a crush on Izzie, which he denied, clarifying that he was attracted to someone else. The conversation was interrupted when Dr. Bailey ordered George and Meredith to assist Dr. Shepherd in trauma.

The trauma case involved Jorge Cruz, who had accidentally shot seven nails into his skull with a nail gun. Jorge was conscious but blind. The team discussed the risks and options for imaging, ultimately deciding on using X-rays and a C-Arm due to the metal in Jorge's head. Jorge's wife, Sona, arrived, upset with him for using the nail gun, and his partner Javi shared Jorge's recent symptoms with Dr. Shepherd.

Cristina presented Nurse Fallon's case to Dr. Preston Burke, hoping to assist in a Whipple procedure. Liz, a scrub nurse, gossiped about Cristina's ambition and noted that Meredith was Ellis Grey's daughter. Dr. Burke assigned Meredith to Fallon's case, thinking she and Liz might have something to talk about, but Liz doubted it, having never met Meredith despite working with Ellis for 18 years.

Izzie took Jorge's history, learning about his headaches and his wife's dislike of guns. The interns researched nail gun injuries, discovering 23 documented cases. Alex teased George about living with women who walked around in their underwear, and George awkwardly tried to explain their relationship as not being like siblings.

Dr. Shepherd prepared for Mr. Humphrey's prostate biopsy, but Mr. Humphrey refused to let Izzie participate due to her modeling past. Cristina and Alex discussed the situation, and Cristina later confronted Izzie about hiding in the hallway. Cristina told Izzie to act like a doctor and do her job, regardless of the patient's attitude.

Dr. Shepherd and Dr. Bailey discussed Jorge's case, considering possible causes for his fall, including a tumor. Meredith summarized the key risks in removing the nails from Jorge's head. The team prepared for the delicate surgery, and Dr. Richard Webber jokingly referred to Izzie as “Dr. Bethany Whisperer,” referencing her modeling alias.

A patient's husband reminisced about his wife's love for the color red, sharing a memory about her running through a field of red poppies. Dr. Shepherd discussed Mr. Humphrey's prognosis, suggesting a radical prostatectomy with a good chance for a normal sex life. The older patient preferred a more conservative approach, and Dr. Burke joked about another surgeon's reputation for not sparing nerves.

During Jorge's surgery, Dr. Bailey explained the importance of removing the nails at the correct angle to avoid further damage. The interns observed, and Alex commented on the X-rays. Cristina and George discussed their hopes for getting to assist in a Whipple procedure. Izzie and George had another awkward exchange about tampons and gender roles.

Meredith and Cristina discussed the importance of remembering patients' names versus just their surgeries. Dr. Shepherd added that some surgeons distance themselves to avoid personal entanglements. Liz's husband visited her, and the interns and nurses checked on her, exchanging friendly banter.

After Jorge's surgery, the team waited to see if his vision would return. Cristina checked with Dr. Burke about scheduling the Whipple for Fallon, but Burke wanted to wait for more lab results. He instructed Cristina to stick with Fallon, and Cristina confirmed she was on call.

Later, Liz Fallon and Meredith had a conversation about Ellis Grey. Liz reminisced about Ellis's work ethic and questioned Meredith about her mother's whereabouts. Meredith lied, saying Ellis was traveling and not practicing, and Liz noted that did not sound like her. The conversation revealed Ellis was actually in a nursing home with early-onset Alzheimer's, a secret Meredith kept from most people.

At home, Izzie and George argued again about the tampons, with Izzie insisting George needed to get over his discomfort with women's issues. George protested that he was not their sister.

The next morning, the roommates discussed breakfast, and Izzie checked on Jorge, who was awake. Elizabeth Fallon asked Jorge to identify the color of her dress, and he confidently answered, showing some memory had returned.

Cristina was reprimanded for waking a patient abruptly and complained about being tired from being on call. Dr. Burke told her not to feel sorry for herself, emphasizing that this was the life of a surgeon. Sona and Jorge joked about his breakfast preferences, and Meredith prepared Jorge for an MRI to check for residual bleeding.

Izzie confronted Mr. Humphrey about his refusal to let her treat him, asserting her qualifications as a doctor and demanding respect. Mr. Humphrey admitted he fantasized about her modeling photo and did not want her to witness his emasculation during surgery.

Meredith and Elizabeth Fallon discussed Fallon's worsening labs and the lack of progress. Meredith pushed for the Whipple surgery, but Fallon was evasive, and Meredith accused her of never intending to operate. Cristina and Meredith discovered Jorge had a tumor in the hypothalamus, and they discussed treatment options with his family: surgery with a risk of memory loss or less invasive radiation with a shorter life expectancy.

Richard Webber told Meredith that his mother remembered Ellis Grey, and Meredith confirmed Ellis's diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's to Cristina, explaining why she kept it secret. Cristina called Ellis a “bitch” for her workaholic ways, and Izzie reflected on Ellis's dedication to the hospital.

Cristina expressed her frustration about the attention Izzie got for her looks, and Izzie downplayed it as makeup and retouching. Cristina joked that if she looked like Izzie, she would walk around naked all the time.

Dr. Bailey scolded the interns for not answering their pages promptly. Sona struggled with the decision about Jorge's surgery, ultimately supporting whatever Jorge wanted, even if it meant years of hardship for her. Izzie apologized for overstepping.

During a code, Liz Fallon's condition deteriorated. Cristina and others attempted to resuscitate her, but she was DNR (do not resuscitate), and the team was forced to let her go. Izzie and Alex discussed the earlier argument about emasculation, and Izzie apologized.

In surgery, Izzie stood up to Dr. Victor, insisting on saving Mr. Humphrey's nerves to preserve his quality of life, as he requested. Dr. Bailey supported Izzie's advocacy for the patient's wishes, and the team proceeded with the nerve-sparing approach.

Meredith reflected on the lack of a rule book for intimacy and the need to define boundaries for oneself. At home, Meredith warned Izzie not to use her toothbrush, and Izzie assured her she was not. Meredith concluded that the rules of intimacy are personal, and the day ended with Izzie wishing Meredith good night.

Meredith Grey began her day reflecting on the overwhelming responsibilities of adulthood, especially as a surgical intern, and how these burdens made her long for the simpler worries of childhood. Her morning took a difficult turn when a lawyer approached her with news that Ellis Grey's Alzheimer's disease was advancing. The lawyer explained that while Ellis was still lucid enough to consent, she needed to sign over her estate to Meredith. Feeling overwhelmed, Meredith protested and asked if someone else could handle the matter, but the lawyer insisted that, as her daughter, the responsibility was hers alone.

At the hospital, Meredith prepared for her first heart surgery, exhausted from lack of sleep and missing rounds. During the procedure, she was given the critical task of holding Mrs. Patterson's heart. Her hands slipped, but Dr. Preston Burke calmly instructed her to gently release the heart and finish the procedure. Internally, Meredith compared the gravity of this responsibility to the trivial concerns she had as a child.

After the surgery, Cristina Yang expressed envy that Meredith had been allowed to hold a heart, joking that even a monkey could do it. The interns, including Cristina and Izzie Stevens, discussed an upcoming party at Meredith's house. Izzie wanted her boyfriend Hank to meet her friends, but Cristina teased her about the party and Hank's sexual prowess. Alex Karev and George O'Malley joined the conversation, and it became clear that the party was growing beyond Meredith's knowledge or approval.

Later, the surgical team faced a crisis when Mrs. Patterson's heart stopped responding after surgery. Dr. Burke led the team in resuscitating her, eventually restoring her rhythm. Meredith, anxious that she might have damaged the heart during surgery, confessed to George that she had nodded off and may have squeezed it or punctured it with her fingernail. George reassured her that Mrs. Patterson was stable and that nothing had happened.

Meanwhile, George was assigned to care for Mrs. Drake, a patient with chronic back pain and a history of lung surgery. George suspected another patient, Jerry Frost, of being a drug seeker, but an attending reminded him that pain must be treated as real regardless of suspicion. Alex was tasked with starting a central line on Jerry, whose veins were damaged from previous treatments.

During Mrs. Drake's surgery, the team discovered a towel left inside her from a previous operation five years earlier. Cristina and George were assigned to investigate who was responsible for the oversight. Mrs. Drake was upset when she learned about the towel, and Cristina was instructed by a senior doctor to keep the matter quiet while it was sorted out.

Izzie and Alex had a tense exchange about the party and their relationship. Alex asked Izzie to dinner, but she declined, citing the party. Alex was annoyed about not being invited. Meanwhile, Meredith was called away to deal with her mother's legal paperwork, leaving party preparations to her friends.

Back at the hospital, Mrs. Patterson suddenly deteriorated, bleeding from her sternum. Cristina and Nurse Tyler tried to stabilize her as Dr. Burke rushed in. Meredith confessed to Dr. Burke that she might have nicked Mrs. Patterson's heart during surgery. Dr. Burke was frustrated that Meredith had not spoken up sooner, especially since she confessed in front of the patient's husband. Cristina criticized Meredith for her honesty, fearing it would get her kicked out of the program.

As the party at Meredith's house spiraled out of control, Izzie tried to manage the chaos. Meredith returned home late from her failed attempt to get her mother's papers signed, as Ellis Grey was confused and unable to consent. Dr. Richard Webber chastised Meredith for not handling her mother's affairs sooner.

At the hospital, Jerry Frost, the drug-seeking patient, tried to avoid discharge by claiming pain. Izzie and Alex forcibly discharged him, but Jerry fell and suffered a subdural bleed, requiring emergency brain surgery. Dr. Derek Shepherd asked Izzie if she wanted to assist, and she agreed, leaving the party behind.

At the party, Meredith was overwhelmed by the number of guests and the chaos. She tried to kick everyone out but was swept up in the revelry. Hank arrived, surprised by the size of the party and frustrated that Izzie was absent. Izzie eventually found Hank outside the hospital, and they argued about her priorities and the demands of her job. Hank left, disappointed.

Later, Meredith and Derek Shepherd shared a quiet moment outside the party, joking about sneaking around and the party winding down. Cristina, Izzie, and George discussed Meredith's impending meeting with the chief, worried about her future in the program.

The next day, Meredith met with Dr. Miranda Bailey, Dr. Preston Burke, and Dr. Richard Webber to discuss Mrs. Patterson's case. Meredith admitted her mistake and presented her research, suggesting that Mrs. Patterson's rapid weight loss may have weakened her heart muscle, making it susceptible to injury. Dr. Bailey criticized Meredith for not reporting the incident immediately, but Dr. Burke defended her for eventually speaking up. Dr. Burke also confessed his own past mistake of leaving a towel in a patient and not reporting it out of fear for his career. He argued that doctors must be able to admit mistakes without fear of retribution.

Meredith was placed on one month's probation but was not expelled from the program. Her friends were relieved, and Meredith acknowledged that Dr. Burke had saved her. The episode ended with Meredith reflecting on the burdens and occasional perks of adulthood, as she and her friends resumed their lives as surgical interns, facing the ongoing responsibilities of their chosen profession.

The next episode began with Meredith Grey and Derek Shepherd discussing the risks of continuing their secret romantic relationship, especially now that their supervisor, Miranda Bailey, had discovered the affair and was pointedly avoiding Meredith. Meredith felt conflicted about being the intern involved with an attending physician, and the tension between her personal and professional life weighed heavily on her.

That morning, Meredith joined her fellow interns—Cristina Yang, Izzie Stevens, George O'Malley, and Alex Karev—for their daily routine. Cristina and Izzie teased George about his supposed feelings for Meredith, but George insisted he was not interested in her romantically. The group reflected on the importance of not procrastinating, echoing Benjamin Franklin's advice, as Meredith internally narrated her own struggles with fear and indecision.

Arriving late to work, Meredith was confronted by Cristina, who pressed her about avoiding her friends since Bailey had caught Meredith and Derek together. Meredith admitted the situation was complicated, especially now that Bailey was not speaking to her. Meanwhile, Derek confided to Meredith that if he were a better man, he would end their relationship, but Meredith remained uncertain about what she wanted.

Bailey gathered the interns and introduced them to Annie Connors, a 43-year-old woman with a massive tumor pressing against her diaphragm. Annie maintained a cheerful demeanor and joked with the interns, particularly Alex, whom she requested to accompany her for her CT scan. The interns were astonished by the tumor's size and speculated about its weight. They learned that Annie had been housebound for over a year, paralyzed by fear of hospitals after losing many family members to illness.

The interns were then assigned to various patients. Meredith presented the case of Mr. LaVangie, a 63-year-old man with Parkinson's disease admitted for pain management. The team discussed the possibility of deep brain stimulation surgery, but Mr. LaVangie was adamant in his refusal to undergo brain surgery. His daughter pleaded with Meredith to persuade him, hoping her father could be well enough to attend her upcoming wedding. Meredith, relating to the daughter's pain because of her own mother's illness, promised to try.

Bailey warned Derek not to show Meredith any favoritism, threatening to keep Meredith out of the operating room if she saw any bias. During Annie's CT scan, a microphone was accidentally left on, and Annie overheard Alex and other interns making insensitive remarks about her condition. Hurt by their comments, Annie requested that Alex not be present during her surgery. Bailey reprimanded the interns for their lack of professionalism, especially Izzie, and banned Izzie from the operating room for the week.

Cristina and Izzie discussed Annie's long delay in seeking medical help, and Izzie later spoke with Annie, who revealed her deep-seated fear of hospitals after losing so many loved ones there. George, attempting to relate, confided in Annie about his own fear of asking out his roommate, but Annie dismissed the comparison as trivial.

Meredith continued to struggle with her relationship with Derek, feeling that his actions—whether favoring her or keeping his distance—were making her look bad in front of her colleagues. Cristina advised Meredith to end the relationship, and Meredith resolved to do so.

The interns were excited about the upcoming surgery to remove Annie's tumor, with Cristina especially eager to participate. Cristina joked that Preston Burke, the attending surgeon, might be interested in her, but the group's camaraderie was strained by the day's stress and the ongoing tension between Meredith and Derek.

Derek made another attempt to convince Mr. LaVangie to consider deep brain stimulation, explaining the risks and benefits, but Mr. LaVangie remained firm in his refusal. Later, Meredith appealed to him, emphasizing how his choices affected his daughter's life and encouraging him to try the surgery for her sake.

The surgery to remove Annie's tumor began, with George and another intern assigned to retract the enormous mass for hours. The surgical team was amazed by the tumor's size and complexity, which was intertwined with major blood vessels. The operation was long and grueling, requiring large amounts of blood.

At the same time, Derek performed the deep brain stimulation procedure on Mr. LaVangie, with Meredith and Izzie assisting. The tense operation required Mr. LaVangie to remain awake while Derek located the correct spot in the brain, and the surgery was ultimately successful.

Elsewhere, Izzie and Cristina were forced to perform an emergency bedside surgery on a post-operative heart patient, Mr. Harper, when his condition suddenly deteriorated. With no attending available, Izzie, coached by Cristina and a resident over the phone, cracked the patient's chest and removed a clot, saving his life.

Back in Annie's surgery, complications arose as the tumor proved even more invasive than expected. The team struggled to control the bleeding, and despite their efforts, Annie died on the operating table. The surgical team was devastated by the loss after their long and exhausting effort.

After the surgeries, Meredith confronted Derek about their relationship, insisting that he could not do her favors or treat her poorly because of their personal involvement. Derek agreed, and Meredith asserted her independence.

Cristina, exhausted and frustrated after hours of holding up the tumor, argued with Burke about the ambiguity of their own relationship, questioning whether he wanted to complicate things further.

George, still in denial about his feelings for Meredith, was told by Alex that Meredith was “off the market,” alluding to her relationship with Derek. George insisted that he and Meredith were just friends.

As the episode drew to a close, Meredith reflected on the importance of facing fears and making decisions, even if they led to mistakes. Derek invited Meredith to watch the sunrise with him, and she realized that trying and failing was better than never trying at all. Derek thanked her, bringing the episode to an end.

Dr. Meredith Grey began her day narrating the challenges of being a surgical intern, describing how sleepless nights stemmed not only from the demands of the hospital but also from personal turmoil. Early in the morning, George O'Malley confided in Izzie Stevens about his longstanding feelings for their roommate Meredith. Izzie encouraged George to be direct and ask Meredith out, but George hesitated, unsure of how to express himself. Meanwhile, Meredith confronted Alex Karev about his abrasive attitude. Alex deflected with a joke, suggesting they share their secret pains over drinks, but Meredith declined, mentioning she was seeing someone. Alex then told George to give up on Meredith because she was "off the market." George, unconvinced, insisted he would know if Meredith were dating someone since they lived together.

At the hospital, Miranda Bailey warned Derek Shepherd that any favoritism toward Meredith would result in Meredith being barred from the operating room for a month. Meredith, after waking up early beside Derek, hurried him out before her roommates could see him and rushed to begin her rounds. Izzie and Cristina Yang teased Meredith about the noises from her room the previous night, speculating about her sex life. George, visibly jealous, joined the debate about whether Meredith was sleeping with Dr. Shepherd. Meredith denied the rumors and tried to change the subject.

During morning assignments, Bailey sent George, Cristina, and Alex to the clinic, while Izzie was to work directly with her. Meredith was dispatched to the emergency room to examine a girl named Claire Rice, who presented with fever and abdominal pain. Claire's mother blamed a recent trip to Mexico for her daughter's illness, but Claire resisted an exam until Meredith insisted. Meanwhile, a patient named Digby Owens arrived with a gunshot wound, claiming it was part of his artistic philosophy about pain and commitment.

Meredith discovered that Claire had recent abdominal surgery, with scars indicating a procedure performed in Mexico. Claire refused to tell her parents what had happened, prompting Meredith to suspect an illegal operation. Meredith discussed her concerns with Bailey, who ordered a CT scan. Elsewhere, a young girl named Jamie Hayes was admitted with a brain abnormality. Meredith reassured Jamie's parents and arranged for Dr. Shepherd to evaluate her.

Cristina received the opportunity to perform a bronchoscopy on her own, interpreting this as recognition of her dedication. Meredith continued to juggle her cases, including Digby, whose fever was worsening due to his gunshot wound. The interns gathered to discuss the risks of sleeping with attendings and the intense pressures of their internship.

Bailey and Meredith reviewed Claire's CT scans and discovered she had undergone a gastric bypass, a surgery typically reserved for obese patients, though Claire was of normal weight. Claire's parents were shocked by the revelation. Bailey explained the risks and the necessity of reversing the surgery. Claire, desperate to remain thin, resisted, but Bailey insisted the decision was out of her hands due to the severity of her medical complications.

Dr. Shepherd diagnosed Jamie with Rasmussen's encephalitis, a progressive brain disease. He explained to Jamie's parents that the only cure was a hemispherectomy, the removal of the diseased half of her brain. Overwhelmed, Jamie's parents consented to the surgery. George was invited to scrub in on the rare procedure and excitedly shared the news with his friends.

During the operation, Dr. Taylor, the anesthesiologist, was suspected of drinking on the job after George and others detected the smell of alcohol. Dr. Shepherd confronted Taylor, who denied the accusation but later nodded off during surgery, nearly causing a crisis. Shepherd and the surgical team managed the situation, and Taylor was removed from the operating room.

Meanwhile, Digby Owens' condition deteriorated due to an infected tattoo worsened by his gunshot wound. He was transferred to the ICU and started on antibiotics, but soon went into multisystem organ failure. The medical team attempted to resuscitate him.

Claire's surgery to reverse the bypass was successful, but she lost a significant portion of her bowel and would face lifelong nutritional challenges. Bailey and Meredith spoke with Claire's mother, reflecting on how Claire's need for approval may have driven her to such a risky decision.

After Jamie's hemispherectomy, Cristina explained to the other interns how the brain would compensate for the loss. Exhausted, the interns reflected on the intensity and reality of their work. Dr. Shepherd and George discussed the incident with Dr. Taylor, acknowledging the importance of responsibility and the unspoken code among doctors.

At home, Meredith and Izzie talked about Meredith's relationship with Dr. Shepherd. Izzie, feeling she had to work harder for respect, expressed frustration that Meredith was risking her reputation. Cristina realized Meredith was falling for Shepherd, which Meredith initially denied but then admitted. The friends teased Meredith about her love life.

As the day ended, Meredith reflected on the idea that people might be wired to seek pain because it makes them feel real. In a quiet moment, Derek and Meredith joked together about why people keep hitting themselves with a hammer—because it feels so good when they stop.

Meredith Grey began by reflecting on childhood fantasies of fairy tales and perfect lives, recalling images of white dresses and Prince Charming. As Meredith grew older, she realized these dreams faded, but she admitted that a small part of hope always remained.

In the kitchen, Izzie Stevens became fixated on baking cupcakes, determined to recreate the taste from her childhood but unable to remember the missing ingredient. Meredith and Cristina Yang sampled Izzie's cupcakes, with Cristina joking that Martha Stewart would be proud. Izzie lamented that something was missing and refused to call her mother for the recipe, despite encouragement from Meredith and Cristina. Cristina suggested they spend the night at Izzie's house for a change, sparking playful debate about whose place felt more like home.

The next morning, the interns gathered and Izzie offered her cupcakes. Cristina teased Meredith about her daily muesli habit, and the group continued their lighthearted argument about whose house they stayed at more often. Cristina checked her schedule, hoping to arrange a light rotation for an upcoming procedure. The scheduler told her the only available slot was on the 16th. Cristina, who was pregnant, was counseled about alternatives to termination, but she chose to schedule the procedure for the 16th, planning to confirm after rearranging her shifts.

Dr. Miranda Bailey assigned the interns to new patients. Izzie and Alex Karev met Devo, a 17-year-old girl hospitalized for excessive bleeding after a root canal. Devo, who joked about her name and her parents' drug use, preferred to be called Esther. Bailey ordered Alex to run labs and additional tests after discovering Devo had a heart murmur and fever.

The interns were also assigned Mr. Duff, a patient transferred from the psychiatric ward after experiencing seizures and claiming to be psychic. The psych resident explained that Mr. Duff talked to dead people and was considered dangerous by his family. The interns began a neurological workup, and during their examination, Mr. Duff predicted that someone would die on the fourth floor. The interns dismissed the prediction, but it soon became a topic of conversation among the hospital staff.

George O'Malley was asked to cover a shift on the 16th and discussed his appearance and personal life with colleagues. Meanwhile, Meredith tried to learn more about Derek Shepherd's personal life, asking about his friends and what he did on his days off. Derek remained evasive, insisting he was a surgeon without friends, but Meredith pressed for answers, joking that she would keep her pants on until he opened up. Derek encouraged her to be flexible and see where their relationship would go.

Devo's parents were informed that she needed a valve replacement due to von Willebrand's disease. The doctors recommended a porcine valve, but Devo and her Orthodox Jewish family objected for religious reasons. The team discussed alternatives, and Izzie later found a more complicated but acceptable bovine valve option.

Another patient, Mrs. Glass, was pregnant and diagnosed with breast cancer. She and her husband faced a heartbreaking decision: undergo aggressive cancer treatment and terminate the pregnancy, or keep the baby and risk her own life. After much deliberation, they decided to keep the baby despite the risks.

Mr. Walker, a patient suffering progressive paralysis after a rock climbing accident, presented a mystery. Despite clear MRI scans, his condition worsened. The team debated whether his symptoms were psychosomatic, but Derek suspected a missed clot in the upper spine and decided to operate. During surgery, the team encountered complications but ultimately found and removed the clot, halting the progression of paralysis.

George O'Malley struggled with his confidence after failing an intubation attempt, but later redeemed himself by successfully intubating a patient during surgery. Cristina and Izzie encouraged him, and Cristina joked that he needed to ask out a nurse.

Cristina, feeling overwhelmed by her first bovine valve replacement surgery, sought advice from Dr. Burke. Burke advised her to research and get assistance, reminding her that some problems had solutions, while others did not.

Izzie became emotionally invested in Mr. Duff's case. After discovering an arteriovenous malformation in his brain, she pushed for surgery. Bailey warned Izzie about getting too involved with patients. As the team prepared for Mr. Duff's surgery, he expressed concern that removing the AVM might take away his psychic abilities, which had defined his life. Izzie reassured him that if his visions were real, he would still have them after surgery.

Before Devo's surgery, she requested a rabbi to bless her, and Izzie arranged it. Dr. Chesney, an expert in bovine valve replacements, assisted via satellite during the procedure. Alex, who had earlier doubted the clot surgery, was teased by Cristina and Izzie. Dr. Burke allowed Alex to scrub in on the bovine valve surgery after he secured the necessary valve, but warned him not to act without consulting attendings in the future.

After the surgeries, Mr. Duff thanked Izzie for believing in him and showed some improvement. Meredith reflected on faith, acknowledging that reality often differed from fairy tales, but happiness could still be found in the present.

Meredith finally called her mother, using the childhood nickname “Cricket,” and said she had been thinking about her. Derek, in turn, opened up to Meredith, sharing personal details about his family, favorite things, and quirks, telling her that the rest she would have to take on faith.

As the day ended, Meredith narrated about faith and the surprises people could bring, while the characters found moments of connection, hope, and happiness in their imperfect lives.

Dr. Meredith Grey began the day reflecting on the nature of secrets and how they inevitably come to light within the hospital. Early in the morning, Meredith, Cristina Yang, and Izzie Stevens gathered to discuss Meredith's ongoing sexual relationship with Derek Shepherd. Cristina pressed Meredith for more details, but Meredith admitted she knew little about Derek beyond their nightly encounters. Cristina joked that she deserved more information, and Meredith retorted that Cristina already knew more than most. Cristina speculated about Derek's reasons for leaving New York and moving to Seattle.

Meanwhile, George O'Malley became the target of teasing from Cristina and Izzie, who encouraged him to ask out a red-haired nurse named Olivia Harper. Despite his awkwardness, George managed to interact with Olivia, and the two began a relationship. Later, Izzie caught George in the bathroom, leading to an embarrassing misunderstanding about his activities. Izzie and Meredith teased him, but George insisted he had a real girlfriend.

Meredith received a call from Miss Henry at her mother's nursing home, but she dismissed it, unwilling to discuss her mother's condition. Izzie and George continued their banter about George's supposed bathroom activities, with George adamant about his relationship with Olivia.

Cristina was seen making a phone call to confirm an appointment for a medical procedure, hinting at a personal health issue. Preston Burke tried to connect with Cristina, but she avoided giving him her home number and left abruptly.

At the hospital, George developed a rash and nervously asked Cristina to examine it. Cristina bluntly informed him that the rash was on his penis and called Alex Karev for a second opinion. Alex diagnosed George with syphilis. Mortified, George became the subject of gossip among the interns. Alex joked about George's predicament, and Cristina insisted that George needed to tell Olivia so she could get tested. George struggled with how to break the news to her.

The interns were assigned to assist Dr. Burke with a patient named Bill, a friend of Burke's from college. Bill was admitted for abdominal pain and blood in his urine. During a procedure, the team discovered a mass in Bill's bladder. Chromosome analysis later revealed that the mass was actually an ovary, and Bill was a chimera, possessing DNA from two embryos that had merged in the womb, resulting in both male and female reproductive organs. Bill was shocked by the revelation and worried about what to tell his pregnant wife, Holly.

As George's syphilis diagnosis became the talk of the hospital, Miranda Bailey addressed the staff about a syphilis outbreak, urging everyone to get tested and practice safe sex. Patricia gave a condom demonstration to the staff, further embarrassing George.

George finally told Olivia about his diagnosis in a rambling, awkward conversation. Olivia revealed that she already knew she had syphilis and admitted she had been seeing someone else before George, but ended that relationship when she realized she liked George more.

Elsewhere, the interns were tasked with performing a paracentesis on Mr. Franklin, a patient suffering from severe abdominal swelling due to liver disease. They performed the procedure, but Mr. Franklin died unexpectedly. The interns were devastated and questioned whether they had made a mistake. Bailey reassured them that they had followed protocol and that Mr. Franklin's death was likely due to his underlying heart and liver disease. The family initially refused an autopsy, but after discussion, the interns decided to perform an unauthorized autopsy to clear their names. During the autopsy, they discovered that Mr. Franklin had a genetic blood disorder, hematomacrosis, which had caused his heart failure, not the procedure they performed. They informed the family, who were upset about the unauthorized autopsy but relieved to learn the truth and that the disease was treatable if caught early.

Burke confronted Bill's wife, Molly, about the paternity of her unborn child, since Bill was sterile due to his condition. Molly insisted that what Bill didn't know wouldn't hurt him and begged Burke not to tell him. Burke struggled with his loyalty as a friend versus his duty as a doctor but ultimately decided that Bill deserved to know the truth.

Meredith continued to avoid her mother's situation, but Miss Henry informed her that her mother, Ellis Grey, had been asking for her. Meredith confided in Cristina about her mother's Alzheimer's diagnosis and the burden of keeping it a secret.

Bailey discovered that the interns had performed an unauthorized autopsy and was furious, warning them of the legal and professional consequences. However, the results of the autopsy vindicated the interns, as they discovered the true cause of death and potentially saved a family member's life by identifying the genetic disorder.

As the day ended, Meredith reflected on the relief and consequences of exposing secrets. George learned from Olivia that she had been seeing Alex Karev before him and realized that was how he contracted syphilis. He confronted Alex in anger, causing a scene in the hospital.

Cristina and Meredith shared a quiet moment, discussing the exhaustion of the day and the comfort found in sharing secrets. Derek approached Meredith to apologize, but before he could explain, Addison Shepherd arrived, introducing herself as Derek's wife and confronting Meredith as the woman who had been sleeping with her husband. Meredith was left stunned as she realized the full consequences of secrets coming to light.
