Meredith Grey began her story by reflecting on the pressures of becoming a surgeon, especially in the shadow of her mother, Ellis Grey's, celebrated career. After waking up beside Derek Shepherd, a man she had spent the night with, Meredith felt embarrassed and hurriedly urged Derek to leave, anxious about being late for her first day as a surgical intern. Derek tried to prolong their flirtation, but Meredith insisted he go, and they awkwardly exchanged names before she rushed out.

Arriving at Seattle Grace Hospital, Meredith joined the other new interns—Cristina Yang, George O'Malley, and Izzie Stevens—for orientation. Meredith's internal monologue revealed her anxiety about the difficult road ahead, knowing that only a few interns would survive the demanding residency. Dr. Richard Webber, the Chief of Surgery, addressed the incoming class, warning them that residency would be both the best and worst time of their lives, and that not everyone would be able to withstand the pressure. Cristina remarked on the low number of women among the interns, while George mentioned that one intern was rumored to be a model.

The interns were introduced to Dr. Miranda Bailey, who was known for her strictness and was nicknamed "the Nazi." Bailey laid out her five rules for survival: no sucking up, answer every page at a run, don't wake her unless a patient is dying, don't let a dying patient be dead when she arrives, and always move when she moves. She made it clear that the interns were at the very bottom of the hospital hierarchy and assigned George to run the code team, Meredith to handle the trauma pager, Cristina to deliver labs, and Izzie to sutures, emphasizing that their job was to keep her happy by doing the grunt work.

The group was immediately thrust into action when a 15-year-old patient named Katie Bryce was brought in with seizures. Bailey assigned Cristina to run labs, George to patient workups, Meredith to take Katie for a CT scan, and Izzie to perform rectal exams on patients. As the interns struggled with their new responsibilities, Meredith and Cristina discussed Katie's puzzling case, noting that her labs were clear and there was no obvious cause for her seizures. George hoped to be chosen for a surgical procedure, since it was rumored that the best intern would get the opportunity on the first shift. Katie, frustrated about missing her beauty pageant, was sarcastic with the interns. Izzie, overwhelmed by the number of rectal exams, complained that Bailey hated her.

The interns gossiped about Meredith's background, revealing that her mother was the renowned surgeon Ellis Grey. Cristina envied Meredith's background, while Izzie admired Ellis's accomplishments. Alex Karev, another intern, joined the group, making crude jokes and antagonizing Izzie by calling her a nurse.

Bailey surprised everyone by announcing that George had been chosen to scrub in for an appendectomy. Cristina and Alex doubted George's abilities and even bet on his failure. In the operating room, George started out well but panicked and made a mistake, causing complications. Dr. Preston Burke, the attending surgeon, took over, and George was left humiliated. The other interns began calling him "007," implying he had a "license to kill" after his near-fatal error.

Katie's condition deteriorated, and the interns scrambled to manage her worsening seizures. Meredith and Cristina worked together to try to diagnose her, reviewing her medical history and ruling out various causes. During this time, Meredith confided in Cristina that she had slept with Dr. Shepherd, who turned out to be Derek, the attending neurosurgeon. Cristina, however, was more interested in solving Katie's case than Meredith's personal life.

Derek gathered the interns and asked for their help in diagnosing Katie, promising that whoever found the answer would assist in her surgery. Meredith and Cristina collaborated and eventually realized that Katie's seizures could be the result of a subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a minor fall during a rhythmic gymnastics rehearsal. They presented their findings to Derek, who confirmed the diagnosis and prepared for surgery. Derek chose Meredith to scrub in, explaining that she had earned the opportunity by helping save Katie's life, not because of their personal connection.

Meanwhile, George was devastated after he had promised a patient's family that their loved one would be fine, only for the patient to die during surgery. Bailey reprimanded George, warning him never to promise a good outcome. Izzie and Cristina argued about the cutthroat nature of the program, with Cristina accusing Izzie of not earning her opportunities.

Meredith decided not to sell her mother's house and planned to find roommates. She visited her mother, Ellis Grey, who was suffering from memory loss and did not recognize Meredith as her daughter. Meredith gently reminded Ellis that she had been a surgeon.

As the first shift ended, Meredith reflected on the challenges and pressures of being a surgeon, admitting that despite the reasons to quit, she loved the work. Derek, Cristina, Izzie, Alex, and George all struggled with the demands of their first day, but they survived. Meredith and Derek shared a brief, professional exchange, agreeing not to make things awkward between them. Meredith concluded that, despite everything, she was staying in the game.

As the group prepared for their first grueling 48-hour shift, Bailey reinforced her expectations, and the interns eagerly sought surgical opportunities but quickly learned that Bailey expected them to focus on menial tasks. Izzie and Alex competed to finish their patient rounds faster, while George grew frustrated by the emotional toll of running the code team, where most patients could not be revived.

A trauma case soon arrived: a 25-year-old rape victim named Allison. Alex and Cristina led the response, and the interns discovered that Allison had fought back fiercely, biting off her attacker's penis, which Meredith identified in a specimen jar. The rape kit was negative, confirming Allison had successfully defended herself. The brutality of the case left the interns shaken.

Elsewhere, Izzie struggled to communicate with a Chinese-speaking patient, Mrs. Liu, and sought help from Cristina, who revealed she was Korean and did not speak Chinese. The language barrier complicated Mrs. Liu's care, and Mrs. Liu's fear of being reported as undocumented made her reluctant to enter the hospital. Meredith, Izzie, and George promised not to report her and treated her wound outside, with Meredith giving her a card to return for follow-up care.

Tensions among the hospital's attendings surfaced when Burke confronted Webber about bringing Derek Shepherd to Seattle Grace, feeling threatened about his own chances of becoming chief of surgery. Webber criticized Burke for only doing what was necessary and challenged him to earn the position.

During her rounds, Meredith noticed a baby in the pediatric ward with a heart murmur and tried to get Burke to check on him. Burke refused without a consult from Pediatrics, citing hospital rules. Meredith later went behind the pediatrician's back to alert the baby's parents, leading to a confrontation between services. Burke ultimately took over the case, ordered tests, and confirmed a congenital heart defect, scheduling surgery for the next day. He sternly warned Meredith never to undermine another doctor again.

Meanwhile, the police searched for Allison's attacker, knowing he would eventually need medical attention. When the rapist was brought into the hospital, severely injured, the surgical team determined that reattaching his penis was impossible due to the nature of the injury. Bailey delivered the news that he would be incontinent and impotent for life.

The episode also highlighted the loneliness of patients like Allison, who had no family in Seattle. The interns reflected on their own support systems and the importance of having people who care. Izzie and George bonded over the difficulties of their day, with Izzie confessing to kissing another doctor, Eric, in the elevator, and the two joked about the absurdity of their lives as interns.

At the end of the episode, Meredith decided to let George and Izzie move in with her, breaking her own rule about keeping boundaries. The interns celebrated, and Cristina teased Meredith about becoming soft. Meredith reflected on the importance and limitations of boundaries, realizing that while they can protect, they can also isolate. She acknowledged that sometimes, crossing lines is necessary for growth and connection. The episode closed with Meredith and Derek sharing a quiet moment, the tension and attraction between them unresolved, as Meredith contemplated the risks and rewards of crossing personal and professional boundaries.
