**Cumulative Series Summary:**

The series opens with Meredith Grey, a new surgical intern at Seattle Grace Hospital, who narrates about the pressures of "the game" of surgery, feeling overshadowed by her renowned surgeon mother, Ellis Grey. After a one-night stand with Derek, whom she believes to be a stranger, Meredith awkwardly dismisses him from her late mother's house before heading to her first day as an intern. At the hospital, Meredith joins fellow interns Cristina Yang, George O'Malley, Izzie Stevens, and Alex Karev. They are warned by their strict resident, Dr. Miranda Bailey ("the Nazi"), about the grueling nature of their training.

The interns are quickly immersed in hospital life: George is unexpectedly chosen to assist Dr. Burke in surgery but falters under pressure, earning the humiliating nickname "007." Izzie is relegated to performing rectal exams, while Cristina and Meredith bond over their ambition and frustration. Meredith is assigned to a complex case: Katie Bryce, a teenage pageant contestant with unexplained seizures. Meredith and Cristina collaborate to diagnose Katie, eventually deducing she has a subarachnoid hemorrhage from a gymnastics injury, impressing Dr. Shepherd—the new attending neurosurgeon, who is revealed to be Meredith's one-night stand, Derek.

Professional and personal tensions arise: Meredith and Derek agree to keep their past private, while Cristina is disappointed when Meredith is chosen to assist in Katie's surgery. Cristina accuses Meredith of benefiting from her mother's reputation and her connection to Shepherd, but Meredith offers the surgery to Cristina, who refuses, insisting Meredith face the consequences of her actions. Meanwhile, Izzie struggles emotionally after a patient dies, having promised the patient's wife he would survive, and is chastised by Dr. Burke for overstepping.

A major trauma case arrives: Allison, a young woman who fought off her attacker, is brought in with severe injuries. During surgery, Meredith discovers Allison bit off her attacker's penis, which she must now keep in her custody for the police. The case emotionally affects Izzie, who relates to Allison through their shared shoes, while Cristina and Alex Karev—newly introduced as her shadow—immediately clash over their competitive natures.

Security brings in a man with a severe groin injury, revealed to be Allison's attacker. The surgical team determines his penis cannot be reattached, ensuring lasting consequences for his crime. Meanwhile, Dr. Burke confronts the chief about his own prospects for chief of surgery, feeling threatened by Derek's recruitment. The chief challenges Burke to prove himself worthy.

Izzie discovers Mrs. Lu is undocumented and afraid to seek care. She treats Mrs. Lu outside the hospital and arranges a secret follow-up, demonstrating her compassion and willingness to bend rules for patients. Meredith's instincts about a baby's heart murmur are validated when Burke confirms the defect and schedules surgery, but he warns her not to bypass protocol again.
