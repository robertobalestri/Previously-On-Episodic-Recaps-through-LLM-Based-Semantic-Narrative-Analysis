Meredith Grey began her first day as a surgical intern by waking up next to Derek Shepherd after a one-night stand. Embarrassed and anxious about being late, Meredith urged Derek to leave her house, insisting on keeping things impersonal despite Derek's attempts at friendliness. During their awkward conversation, Meredith revealed she had just moved from Boston and was in the process of selling her mother's house. At Seattle Grace Hospital, Meredith joined a group of new surgical interns. Dr. Richard Webber, the Chief of Surgery, addressed the group, warning them about the grueling nature of their residency and the high rate of failure among interns. Dr. Miranda Bailey, known as “The Nazi,” introduced herself as their resident and laid out her five strict rules for survival: no sucking up, answer every page at a run, never wake her unless a patient is dying, do not let the patient be dead when she arrives, and always move when she moves. She assigned the interns—Meredith, Cristina Yang, George O'Malley, Izzie Stevens, and Alex Karev—to a demanding 48-hour shift, making it clear that they were at the bottom of the hospital hierarchy and needed to prove themselves before being allowed near an operating table.

Meredith met her fellow interns. George nervously tried to befriend the others, while Cristina's competitive nature was immediately apparent. Izzie's background as a former model drew skepticism from the group, but she remained determined to prove herself. The interns discussed Meredith's background, revealing that her mother was the renowned surgeon Ellis Grey. Away from the hospital, Meredith visited Ellis, who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease in a care facility. The interns bonded over their anxieties and the daunting expectations placed upon them, with Meredith reflecting on the importance of maintaining boundaries with colleagues.

Their first patient was Katie Bryce, a 15-year-old pageant contestant suffering from unexplained seizures. Dr. Bailey assigned Cristina to run labs, George to do patient workups, Meredith to oversee Katie and take her for a CT scan, and Izzie to perform rectal exams. Meredith struggled to connect with Katie, who was distraught about missing her pageant, but Meredith persisted in her duties despite exhaustion. As the interns worked together, they gossiped about Meredith's mother, Ellis Grey, a legendary surgeon. Cristina expressed envy at Meredith's lineage, while George remained unaware of Ellis's reputation.

Dr. Bailey announced that George had been chosen to perform the first surgery, an appendectomy, as a test of his skills. The other interns placed bets on his success. In the operating room, George started confidently but panicked when a complication arose. Dr. Preston Burke took over the surgery, and George was left humiliated, earning the nickname “007” from his peers. Katie's condition deteriorated, and she suffered a cardiac arrest. Meredith and the team struggled to revive her, finally succeeding after several attempts. Dr. Shepherd and Dr. Burke criticized the interns for not paging them sooner. Katie's parents, distraught and desperate for answers, confronted Dr. Shepherd, who admitted he did not yet know the cause of her seizures.

Meanwhile, Dr. Burke performed heart surgery on another patient, Tony Savage, but the patient died due to extensive heart damage. Cristina and George were shaken, especially after having reassured the family. Dr. Bailey reminded them never to promise good outcomes to patients' families. Dr. Shepherd gathered the interns and challenged them to help diagnose Katie, promising that whoever solved the case could assist in her surgery. Meredith and Cristina teamed up, and Meredith confided in Cristina about her night with Dr. Shepherd, explaining her reluctance to work with him. Together, they reviewed Katie's history and realized that a minor fall during a pageant rehearsal could have caused a rare brain aneurysm. They presented their findings to Dr. Shepherd, who confirmed a subarachnoid hemorrhage and prepared for surgery.

Dr. Shepherd chose Meredith to assist in the surgery, explaining that she had earned the right by helping save Katie's life. Though hesitant because of their personal history, Meredith agreed to participate. Cristina was disappointed but accepted Meredith's decision. After the surgery, the interns reflected on their challenging first day. George lamented his failures, while Cristina recalled her mother's doubts about her abilities. Meredith decided to keep her mother's house and considered finding roommates. She visited Ellis Grey, who now suffered from memory loss and did not recognize her. Meredith gently reminded her mother of her past as a surgeon. As the episode ended, Meredith reflected on the difficulties and pressures of being a surgeon, but also on her love for the work. The interns, exhausted but resilient, had survived their first shift and began to form bonds as they faced the challenges ahead.

As the next day unfolded at Seattle Grace, Meredith's thoughts narrated the immense pressure and challenges that awaited her and her fellow interns. Meredith and Derek continued to navigate their complicated relationship, exchanging awkward words about their one-night stand, with Meredith insisting they pretend it never happened because of their professional relationship. Dr. Bailey assigned specific duties to each intern: George was put in charge of the code team, Meredith took the trauma pager, Cristina was tasked with delivering lab results, and Izzie was assigned to sutures. The interns competed for opportunities to assist in surgeries, but Bailey reminded them that no one would hold a scalpel until she was satisfied with their work.

Meredith also spent time interviewing potential roommates for her house. Izzie tried to convince her by promising to be quiet and responsible, while George admitted that his mother still ironed his scrubs. Though initially reluctant, Meredith eventually agreed to let both Izzie and George move in. Back at the hospital, a rape victim named Allison arrived in the emergency room with severe injuries. Derek and Meredith took charge of her care, coordinating her treatment and preparing her for scans. The interns were shocked to learn that Allison had bitten off her attacker's penis during the assault. Meredith was given the responsibility of maintaining the chain of custody for the severed organ until the police arrived.

Meanwhile, Izzie struggled to communicate with a non-English-speaking patient, Mrs. Liu, who feared being reported due to her immigration status. Izzie and Meredith promised to help her without jeopardizing her safety, ultimately treating her wound outside the hospital to avoid legal complications. Cristina and Alex competed to deliver lab results and see patients as quickly as possible, each trying to prove their competence. George, overwhelmed by his responsibilities on the code team, lost several patients and felt like the “angel of death.” Cristina reassured him that most code patients could not be revived and that it was not his fault.

Meredith noticed a baby in the nursery with a heart murmur and brought it to Dr. Burke's attention. Although Dr. Burke initially refused to intervene without a consult from pediatrics, he eventually agreed to run tests and confirmed a congenital heart defect that required surgery. Meredith was warned not to overstep her boundaries again. The rapist, severely injured, was brought into the hospital. The surgical team, including Bailey, Shepherd, Burke, and the interns, discussed the impossibility of reattaching his penis due to the extent of the injury. They operated to save his life, but he would suffer permanent consequences.

Throughout the exhausting shift, the interns supported each other through their emotional turmoil and reflected on the challenges of being new doctors. Meredith, Cristina, and Izzie discussed the loneliness of patients like Allison, who had no family in Seattle, and compared it to their own experiences. By the end of the episode, Meredith decided to let Izzie and George move in with her, realizing that boundaries sometimes keep out people who should be let in. Meredith and Derek shared a moment, hinting at the ongoing tension between them. Meredith reflected on the importance of taking risks and crossing lines, concluding that while some boundaries are necessary, others are meant to be challenged.
