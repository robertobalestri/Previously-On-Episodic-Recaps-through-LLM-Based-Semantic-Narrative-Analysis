Meredith Grey began her first day as a surgical intern feeling overwhelmed by the legacy of her mother, Ellis Grey, a renowned surgeon. The morning started with Meredith waking up beside Derek Shepherd, a man she had met at a bar the previous night. Embarrassed by the one-night stand and eager to make a good impression on her first day, Meredith hurried Derek out of her house. They exchanged names and parted ways, agreeing not to pretend there was anything more between them.

At Seattle Grace Hospital, Dr. Richard Webber welcomed the new class of surgical interns, warning them about the intense competition and grueling demands of residency, and that their seven years would be both the best and worst of their lives. Meredith joined fellow interns Cristina Yang, Izzie Stevens, and George O'Malley as they were introduced to their supervisor, Dr. Miranda Bailey, infamous for her strictness and known as “the Nazi.” Cristina and Izzie were surprised to find that Dr. Bailey was a woman, while George nervously tried to make friends with his new colleagues.

Dr. Bailey laid out her five rules for the interns, emphasizing discipline and quick responses, and introduced them to their first grueling 48-hour shift, making it clear they were at the bottom of the surgical hierarchy. The group was immediately assigned their first patient, Katie Bryce, a fifteen-year-old girl suffering from unexplained seizures. Meredith was given responsibility for Katie and took her for a CT scan, while Cristina, Izzie, and George discussed the pressures of their new roles and speculated about Dr. Bailey's tough reputation. They also teased George about his nerves, especially after Dr. Bailey selected him to perform the first surgery of their class—an appendectomy. Despite Cristina's doubts, George entered the operating room with the support of his fellow interns, who placed bets on his success. During the procedure, George initially performed well but made a critical mistake, forcing Dr. Preston Burke to take over. The incident earned George the nickname “007” for his “license to kill.”

As Katie Bryce's condition deteriorated, Meredith and Cristina teamed up to solve the mystery behind her seizures, agreeing to share the reward of scrubbing in on the surgery if they succeeded. Meredith confided in Cristina about her night with Derek Shepherd, complicating her feelings as she realized he was one of the attending surgeons. Meanwhile, the interns faced other medical challenges, including a post-operative patient with a fever. Cristina correctly diagnosed the cause as a pulmonary embolus, demonstrating her medical acumen.

Meredith and Cristina continued to investigate Katie's case, eventually deducing that a minor fall during rhythmic gymnastics practice had caused a rare subarachnoid hemorrhage. They presented their findings to Derek Shepherd, who confirmed the diagnosis and prepared for surgery. Derek praised Meredith and Cristina for their work and invited Meredith to scrub in on the operation, assuring her that she had earned the opportunity through her efforts, not because of their personal connection. Though hesitant at first, Meredith accepted and experienced the thrill of participating in her first surgery.

Elsewhere in the hospital, Dr. Burke performed heart surgery on a patient named Mr. Savage, but complications arose and the patient died. George was given the difficult task of informing Mr. Savage's wife, Gloria, about her husband's death. The experience weighed heavily on George, and Derek Shepherd reminded him not to make promises to patients' families, as only God could guarantee outcomes.

As the exhausting first day continued, Dr. Bailey assigned new tasks to the interns: George was put in charge of the code team, Meredith took the trauma pager, Cristina was responsible for delivering labs, and Izzie was assigned to sutures. The interns competed for opportunities to assist in surgery, but Bailey reminded them their primary job was to keep her happy, not to hold scalpels. The group bantered about Meredith's famous mother and the pressures of living up to a renowned legacy. Meredith visited Ellis Grey, who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and struggled with the emotional distance between them.

Searching for roommates, Meredith interviewed several applicants, including George and Izzie. Both tried to persuade her with promises of cleanliness and quiet, but Meredith hesitated, preferring strangers she wouldn't have to interact with. Despite her reservations, she began to consider George and Izzie as potential roommates.

Meredith and Derek Shepherd spoke about Seattle's ferry boats, with Derek flirting and Meredith insisting they maintain professional boundaries and not repeat their previous night together. Their conversation revealed Meredith's reluctance to settle in Seattle.

A trauma case arrived when a 25-year-old rape victim named Allison was brought in with severe injuries. Meredith and other doctors coordinated Allison's care, noting her resilience. During the examination, they discovered Allison had bitten off her attacker's penis, shocking the team. Meredith was tasked with maintaining custody of the severed organ until the police arrived.

Dr. Addison Montgomery, a new attending, discussed her recent move from New York to Seattle, revealing she had been recruited by Chief Webber. Tensions simmered between Dr. Burke and Webber over surgical assignments and the arrival of Shepherd.

George and Izzie discussed the responsibilities of the code team, while Cristina teased George about his optimism. The interns interacted with a lab technician delivering results, and Cristina claimed Alex Karev as her shadow for the day. Alex's abrasive attitude annoyed Meredith, who expressed her dislike for him.

George led a code in the ER, revealing his inexperience and anxiety. Izzie treated Mrs. Liu, a patient who did not speak English, and struggled to communicate with her. Meredith continued to safeguard the severed penis from the rape case, and the interns joked about the bizarre responsibility.

Dr. Bailey diagnosed a patient with a rare but minor disorder, reassuring them they did not need surgery and would be discharged. The interns discussed the severed penis, with Cristina explaining its origin and the chain of custody rules.

Meredith was deeply affected by Allison's case, noticing they wore the same shoes that day, which made her reflect on the randomness of trauma. She confided in her colleagues about feeling tired and overwhelmed.

Izzie discovered a baby with a heart murmur and confronted the attending physician, who dismissed her concerns. Izzie persisted and sought help from Dr. Burke, who initially refused to intervene without a consult. After Meredith advocated for the baby's care, Burke agreed to run tests but warned Meredith against going behind other doctors' backs.

Mrs. Liu, fearing deportation, resisted treatment for her wound. Izzie reassured her, promising not to report her status, and treated her outside the hospital, risking her own job. Mrs. Liu was grateful, and Izzie gave her instructions for follow-up care.

The team operated on Allison, but her prognosis remained uncertain. The rapist was brought into the hospital, and the staff discussed the impossibility of reattaching his penis due to the nature of the injury. Dr. Bailey explained the consequences for the attacker, and the interns reflected on the brutality of the case.

Burke and Webber argued about surgical assignments and leadership, with Bailey challenging Burke to earn the position of chief by going beyond the minimum requirements. Alex apologized to Izzie for his earlier behavior.

The interns gathered, exhausted and doubting their abilities. George lamented losing five patients on the code team, feeling like the angel of death, and Cristina comforted him by explaining the realities of code patients. Meredith, Izzie, and George discussed the divide between interns and attendings, feeling isolated from the real practice of medicine.

Meredith finally decided to let George and Izzie move in as her roommates, admitting she needed connection despite her desire for boundaries. The group celebrated, and Meredith reflected on the importance of crossing lines rather than drawing them.

As the day closed, Meredith visited Ellis Grey and introduced herself, acknowledging her mother's legacy as a surgeon. Meredith considered the challenges and rewards of being a surgeon, realizing she loved the work and resolved to stay and fight for her place in the hospital. As the episode ended, Meredith and Derek Shepherd shared a quiet moment, acknowledging the complexity of their relationship and the risks of crossing professional boundaries. Meredith concluded that while boundaries can protect, they can also isolate, and sometimes taking risks leads to spectacular outcomes.

Meredith began her next day reflecting on the relentless competition among surgical residents, observing that she, Izzie, George, and Cristina spent more time together than apart. At Meredith's house, Izzie complained that George's room was larger than hers and argued she deserved the bigger space for her expanding wardrobe. George insisted he had arrived first and deferred the decision to Meredith, since it was her house. Cristina interjected, declaring that everything in their world was a competition, and that residents constantly kept score and tried to outmaneuver one another.

Izzie suggested they make the house feel more like a home by unpacking boxes belonging to Ellis Grey, including a collection of tapes showing her performing medical procedures. Cristina was intrigued by the idea of watching the tapes, but Meredith hesitated, uncertain about revisiting her mother's legacy. The group discussed the possibility of Ellis Grey returning and the significance of her belongings in the house.

At the hospital, Meredith greeted Dr. Bailey, who brusquely reminded her of the strict hierarchy among staff. George felt uneasy, sensing he was forgetting something important about the day. The residents and interns soon learned about the annual “Dead Baby Bike Race,” an illegal and dangerous event where bike messengers raced through city traffic for prizes. Alex Karev explained the race's lack of rules, except for “no eye gouging,” and Cristina expressed excitement about the competitive nature, while Izzie questioned the sanity of the participants.

Dr. Bailey assigned George to assist Chief Webber, but Webber instead instructed George to monitor his pre- and post-operative patients. George was tasked with caring for Lloyd Mackey, a VIP patient suffering from liver cancer. Mackey joked about his situation and flirted with George, while Izzie encouraged him, noting that he was at the top of the donor list. Mackey, however, remained cynical about his chances of survival.

The emergency room was soon overwhelmed with trauma cases from the bike race. Cristina and other residents treated a John Doe pedestrian who had been struck by a car avoiding a cyclist. The patient was declared brain dead, and Derek Shepherd ordered confirmatory tests. The team discussed the technicalities of brain death and organ donation, with Izzie clinging to hope for a miracle and struggling emotionally with the process.

Izzie and Cristina searched through the John Doe's belongings, finding clues that suggested he had a family. They worked to identify him and contacted the police, hoping to obtain consent for organ donation. Cristina and Izzie debated the ethics of harvesting organs from a John Doe, and Izzie pleaded with the patient to survive.

As time ran out, Izzie and Cristina decided to administer dopamine and blood transfusions to keep the patient viable for organ donation, despite the ethical ambiguity. Cristina discovered that the patient had a traumatic aortic injury and required surgery to remain a viable donor. The interns strategized how to persuade Dr. Burke to perform the surgery, ultimately going over his head to Chief Webber by highlighting the match between the John Doe and Mackey's liver needs.

Dr. Burke was initially resistant but eventually agreed to perform the surgery. The police identified the John Doe as Kevin Davidson, and his wife, Mrs. Davidson, arrived at the hospital. The team discussed organ donation with Mrs. Davidson, explaining the process and its potential to help burn victims and others in need. Alex struggled with communicating with families and was reminded by Dr. Bailey that patients were people, not just collections of organs.

Lloyd Mackey expressed gratitude to George for finding him a liver, and the two shared a heartfelt conversation about attraction and boldness in the face of death. George admitted his feelings for Meredith, and Mackey encouraged him to be courageous.

The organ harvest proceeded, and Cristina carefully sewed up Kevin Davidson for his family. Mrs. Davidson was brought in to see her husband, and the team offered comfort. Meanwhile, Viper, a recurring patient from the bike race, returned to the emergency room, and Alex and Cristina managed his case.

Throughout the day, the residents faced personal and professional challenges, wrestling with competition, ethical dilemmas, and emotional struggles. Meredith reflected on the nature of competition and survival, concluding that true victories were measured by lives saved. The day ended with the group gathered together, watching Ellis Grey's surgical tapes, sharing a moment of camaraderie and learning.

Meredith Grey narrated her thoughts on intimacy, describing it as something people both desire and fear, and reflecting on how it connects to relatives, romance, and roommates. Early in the morning, Meredith navigated the awkwardness of sharing a house with George O'Malley and Izzie Stevens. George felt uncomfortable when Izzie and Meredith walked around in their underwear while he was naked in the shower, but Izzie teased him and told him to get used to it. The three argued about household responsibilities, including buying tampons, which George refused to do, insisting that as a man, he didn't buy “girl products.”

At the hospital, Cristina Yang instructed the interns on how to conduct pre-rounds, emphasizing the importance of bedside manner and making residents look good to avoid trouble. Cristina, Izzie, and Meredith discussed their hopes for interesting cases, with Cristina hoping to scrub in on a Whipple procedure for Elizabeth Fallon, a former scrub nurse at the hospital who was now a patient with pancreatic cancer. When Cristina met Nurse Fallon, Fallon immediately recognized Cristina's ambition and called her out for trying to get assigned to her surgery, insisting on being called Nurse Fallon and referring to Cristina as “Christina.”

Meanwhile, Izzie attempted to examine Mr. Humphrey, a patient scheduled for a prostate biopsy, but he refused, preferring Dr. Bailey or Dr. Victor instead. George continued to struggle with the roommate situation and asked Meredith if she thought he had a crush on Izzie, which he denied, saying he was attracted to someone else. Their conversation was interrupted when Dr. Bailey paged George and Meredith to assist Derek Shepherd in trauma.

The trauma patient, Jorge Cruz, had fallen down stairs while holding a nail gun, resulting in seven nails embedded in his skull. Meredith, George, Izzie, Alex Karev, and Derek Shepherd worked together to stabilize Jorge, who was conscious but blind. With the CT scanner down, they opted for X-rays and a C-Arm insertion to guide the removal of the nails. Jorge's wife, Sona, arrived, and the team gathered his medical history, learning he had been experiencing headaches and dizziness for months.

Dr. Bailey presented Nurse Fallon's case to the attending physicians. Cristina was disappointed to learn that Meredith would be assigned to Fallon instead of her. Fallon revealed that she had been Ellis Grey's scrub nurse for eighteen years but had never met Meredith, Ellis's daughter.

In the locker room, Alex Karev questioned George about living with Meredith and Izzie, asking if they walked around in sexy underwear and if it was like living with sisters. George awkwardly denied it, insisting it wasn't like that.

Cristina and Izzie researched nail gun injuries to the head, finding twenty-three documented cases, most accidental. The team prepared for Jorge's surgery, discussing the risks of bleeding and infection and the importance of removing the nails at the exact angle they entered. During rounds, Dr. Burke assigned Cristina to get a history from Jorge before scrubbing in. Jorge's wife Sona scolded him for the accident, and the team continued to prepare for surgery. The surgery was successful, and the team waited to see if Jorge's vision would return.

Nurse Fallon's condition worsened, with labs showing elevated liver enzymes and worsening jaundice. Cristina and Izzie pushed Dr. Burke to schedule the Whipple procedure, but he wanted to wait for biopsy results. Dr. Bailey suspected Burke never intended to operate, believing Fallon was admitted to die in the hospital where she spent her career.

Meredith learned from Richard Webber that her mother, Ellis Grey, was in a nursing home with early-onset Alzheimer's and didn't want anyone to know. Richard was the only person Ellis allowed to visit her.

Izzie faced ridicule from other interns and staff after her lingerie modeling photos appeared in a magazine. She confronted Mr. Humphrey, who admitted he fantasized about her as a model and didn't want her present during his emasculating surgery. Izzie asserted her professionalism and demanded to be treated as a doctor.

Cristina and Izzie discussed Fallon's worsening condition, with Cristina frustrated that the hospital was just letting her die. Meredith argued that sometimes doing everything could be worse than doing nothing, while Cristina insisted she would want doctors to fight for her life until the end.

In the operating room, Izzie and Cristina advocated for saving Mr. Humphrey's nerves during his prostatectomy, arguing that preserving his chance at a normal sex life was important. Dr. Victor, initially resistant, relented and let Izzie take over the surgery. Dr. Bailey warned Izzie and Cristina that she would report them to Richard Webber, but ultimately supported their decision to give the patient what he wanted.

Jorge Cruz faced a difficult decision about his brain tumor. Derek Shepherd explained the options: removing the tumor could give him five to ten good years but risk memory and personality loss, while focused radiation would preserve his identity but only offer three to five years. Sona insisted the choice was Jorge's, even if it meant ten bad years for her, because she would remember for both of them.

Nurse Fallon's condition deteriorated, and despite efforts to resuscitate her, she died. The team called her time of death.

Meredith reflected on intimacy and the lack of a rule book for it, musing that perhaps the rules of intimacy are something each person must define for themselves. At home, the roommates continued their banter, with Meredith warning them not to use her toothbrush. Meredith wished the patient good night, closing the episode as the characters grappled with professional boundaries, personal relationships, and the emotional complexities of medicine, highlighting the challenges of intimacy in both their personal and professional lives.

Meredith Grey awoke contemplating the simplicity of childhood worries compared to the overwhelming responsibilities of adulthood. As a surgical intern, Meredith found herself facing tasks as daunting as holding a human heart in her hands. Her morning grew more complicated when a lawyer informed her that Ellis Grey was experiencing rapid advancement of Alzheimer's disease. While Ellis was still lucid, she needed to sign her estate over to Meredith. Exhausted from forty-eight hours without sleep and anxious about her first heart surgery, Meredith pleaded for someone else to handle her mother's affairs, but the lawyer insisted it was her responsibility.

During heart surgery, Dr. Burke guided Meredith through the delicate process of releasing Mrs. Patterson's heart. Meredith's hands slipped, prompting an apology, but the procedure continued. Burke instructed the team to warm Mrs. Patterson and take her off bypass. Meredith reflected on how the weight of such responsibility made childhood seem appealing.

After the operation, Izzie Stevens expressed envy over Meredith's opportunity to hold a heart, while Cristina Yang joked that even a monkey could do it. The interns discussed a party planned at Meredith's house, with Cristina and Izzie debating the guest list and Izzie's boyfriend Hank's reputation. Alex Karev and George O'Malley joined the conversation, and Meredith was surprised to learn about the party, insisting she had no idea it was happening.

Back in the operating room, Mrs. Patterson's heart struggled to restart. Burke led the team through compressions and defibrillation until her heart rhythm was restored. Meredith, anxious that she may have damaged the heart during surgery, confessed to George and Izzie that she had nodded off and squeezed the heart, puncturing her glove. George reassured her that Mrs. Patterson was stable and advised her not to tell Burke, but Meredith remained uneasy.

George was assigned to care for Mrs. Drake, a patient suffering from chronic back pain and a history of lung surgery. He and Meredith suspected Mrs. Drake might be addicted to Dilaudid, but Dr. Bailey reminded them to treat her pain seriously. Mrs. Drake shared her struggles with quitting smoking and the skepticism she faced regarding her pain. George comforted her, affirming that her pain was real.

Meanwhile, Mr. Sturman, another patient, joked about never wanting another bowel obstruction and revealed he had dropped out of medical school. He advised Meredith and George that a doctor's first responsibility is always to the patient.

During Mrs. Drake's lung surgery, Burke and Bailey discovered a towel left inside her from a previous operation. Bailey instructed Cristina to investigate who had closed during the initial surgery, while George was tasked with keeping Mrs. Drake happy, as she had taken a liking to him.

Bailey asked George if she was invited to the party, and he awkwardly confirmed. Cristina and Izzie coordinated beer and snacks, debating the guest list and timing, while Alex and Meredith joked about the party invitations.

Mrs. Drake confronted George about the towel, learning that Dr. Weber, the chief, was responsible. Burke instructed the team to keep the discovery quiet while they resolved the issue.

Burke invited Cristina to dinner, suggesting they skip the party and spend time together. Cristina declined, and Burke thanked her for not inviting him, encouraging her to consider dinner in the future.

Suddenly, Mrs. Patterson developed swelling and bleeding over her sternum. Burke, Meredith, and Cristina rushed to stabilize her. Meredith confessed to Burke that she had punctured her glove and may have nicked the heart. Burke was frustrated that Meredith had not spoken up earlier and instructed her to apologize to Mrs. Patterson's husband and review the case history, warning her that her career was at risk.

Meredith feared she could be expelled from the program. Cristina and Izzie debated whether Mrs. Patterson would sue and criticized Meredith for telling Burke. Meredith prepared for a notary appointment regarding her mother's estate, with Bailey and Webber arranging for legal and medical witnesses.

At the party, Izzie and Cristina argued about the guest list and Izzie's relationship with Hank. Meredith arrived late to the notary meeting with Ellis Grey, who was confused and unable to sign the papers due to sundowning. The team realized they should have scheduled the meeting earlier in the day.

Alex and Izzie dealt with Jerry Frost, a patient addicted to pain medication. Alex tried to discharge Jerry, but Jerry resisted, demanding more drugs. During a struggle, Jerry fell and suffered a subdural bleed. Cristina and Alex rushed him to CT, and Derek Shepherd invited Izzie to assist in brain surgery.

At the party, Meredith was overwhelmed by the number of guests. She and Cristina tried to manage the chaos, and Alex offered to kick everyone out. Meredith decided to let the party continue. Hank arrived, frustrated by the crowd and Meredith's absence. Meredith explained her commitment to her job and patients, but Hank felt neglected.

Later, Meredith and Derek Shepherd talked outside. Derek joked about being blown off for tequila, and Meredith asked him to take her for a ride. They agreed the party was winding down and shared a moment before sneaking back inside.

The next morning, Meredith prepared for her meeting with the chief. Cristina apologized for the party getting out of hand. Burke reviewed Mrs. Patterson's case, questioning the cause of her heart wall tearing. Meredith explained that the patient's rapid weight loss had led to muscle loss, including heart muscle, making the heart vulnerable. The hospital administrator criticized Meredith for not reporting the glove puncture immediately, exposing the hospital to liability.

Burke defended Meredith, sharing his own past mistake of leaving a towel in a patient and not reporting it out of fear. He argued that doctors must be able to speak up about errors without fear of repercussions. Meredith was placed on one month probation.

Cristina and Izzie supported Meredith, noting that Burke had saved her. Bailey urged everyone to get back to work. Cristina observed that Burke was always going to report the towel incident, emphasizing that information is power.

Jerry Frost was offered rehab options. Meredith apologized to Mrs. Drake for the towel incident, and Mr. Sturman celebrated his recovery. The interns reflected on missing the party and the challenges of life as surgeons. Meredith concluded that while responsibility was difficult, adulthood offered freedom and independence.

Meredith Grey grappled with the fallout from her romantic involvement with her boss, Derek Shepherd. Their relationship, forbidden by hospital rules, created tension among the interns and drew the disapproval of Miranda Bailey. Meredith's inner turmoil was compounded when a lawyer informed her that her mother's Alzheimer's was worsening, and she needed to sign over power of attorney while her mother was still lucid. Distracted by this news, Meredith arrived late to work, further straining her relationship with Bailey, who was already upset about Meredith's affair with an attending.

Meanwhile, George O'Malley endured teasing from Cristina Yang and Izzie Stevens about his feelings for Meredith. Although George denied any romantic interest, it was clear to his friends that he cared deeply for her. Cristina confronted Meredith about her recent avoidance, but Meredith was unwilling to discuss her problems. Cristina pointed out that Bailey was no longer speaking to Meredith, heightening Meredith's anxiety about the consequences if her relationship with Derek were discovered.

The interns were assigned to new patients. One major case involved Annie Connors, a 43-year-old woman whose massive tumor had left her housebound for a year. Preston Burke, Bailey, and the interns discussed the complexity of Annie's surgery. Annie, preferring to be called by her first name, maintained a cheerful demeanor and flirted with Alex Karev, asking him to accompany her for a CT scan. During the scan, Alex and a technician made insensitive remarks about Annie's condition, unaware that Annie could hear them through the microphone. Hurt by their words, Annie later refused to have Alex in her operating room, and Bailey punished Alex by banning him from the OR for a week.

George presented a post-op heart patient, Mr. Harper, to Bailey and became involved in his care. Meredith was assigned to Mr. LaVangie, a 63-year-old man with Parkinson's disease who had been admitted for pain management. Mr. LaVangie's daughter asked Meredith to discuss the possibility of deep brain stimulation surgery, a risky procedure that could improve his quality of life. Meredith empathized with her, sharing her own experience of watching her mother's decline.

The surgical team debated the best approach for Annie's tumor, which had infiltrated her spine and displaced her lungs. Derek Shepherd voiced concerns about the risks, including paralysis and death, but ultimately agreed to attempt the surgery. Annie's mother insisted on proceeding, but Annie remained firm about excluding Alex from the operation.

Cristina and Izzie were excited to scrub in on Annie's surgery. Cristina joked about Preston Burke's interest in her, and the interns exchanged banter about their relationships and the challenges of their program. Meredith confided in Annie about her tendency to put things off, and Annie admitted her fear of hospitals stemmed from losing loved ones there. Meredith also discussed her conflicted feelings about her relationship with Derek, worried about favoritism and her reputation.

The surgeries commenced. Cristina and Izzie assisted on Annie's tumor removal, which proved extremely difficult due to its size and vascularity. Meanwhile, Derek and Meredith persuaded Mr. LaVangie to undergo deep brain stimulation before his condition worsened. The procedure was performed while Mr. LaVangie was awake, and the team successfully improved his symptoms.

In Annie's operating room, the surgery became increasingly perilous as the tumor bled heavily and the team ran low on blood supplies. Despite their efforts, Annie died on the table, leaving the team exhausted and disappointed. Cristina, in particular, felt her hard work had been for nothing.

Elsewhere, George and Izzie faced a crisis when Mr. Harper crashed. Forced to perform an emergency bedside thoracotomy, Izzie was terrified, having never done the procedure before. Cristina talked her through it, and Izzie managed to remove a clot and massage the heart, saving Mr. Harper's life. The attending surgeon was initially angry that he hadn't been paged, but Izzie insisted she had tried multiple times.

After the surgeries, tensions flared among the interns. Cristina told Meredith she was done doing her favors, feeling unappreciated after holding up Annie's tumor for hours only for the patient to die. Izzie and Alex argued about their dynamic, with Izzie rejecting Alex's advances and hinting she might be seeing someone else. George and Alex discussed Meredith, and Cristina told Alex that Meredith was “off the market,” though George insisted they were just friends.

As the day ended, Meredith reflected on the events, realizing that taking action, even when it led to failure, was better than doing nothing at all. Derek invited Meredith to watch the sunrise over the ferry boats, recalling a detail from their earlier conversations. Meredith narrated about the importance of seizing the day and learning from mistakes, concluding that even the worst failures were better than never trying at all.

Meredith Grey reflected on the exhaustion of being a surgical intern, noting that sleepless nights were caused by more than just the demands of the job. Early in the morning, Meredith woke Derek Shepherd in her bedroom, urging him to leave before her roommates discovered his presence. Cristina Yang suggested letting Derek sleep, but Meredith insisted he had to go. Meanwhile, Izzie Stevens and George O'Malley speculated about Meredith's sex life, wondering if she was involved with Derek, their boss. Izzie questioned why Meredith kept the relationship secret if she wasn't ashamed, and when Meredith entered, her roommates teased her about her “radical sex” the previous night. Meredith deflected their questions, claiming the man was “no one you know.” Miranda Bailey interrupted, reminding the interns they were late.

As the day began, Bailey assigned George, Cristina, and Alex Karev to the clinic, keeping Izzie with her. Meredith, still tired, received a list of patients and tasks from Bailey, including a consult for a girl with fever and abdominal pain. Meredith encountered a patient whose boyfriend had swallowed her keys to prevent her from leaving him, and she was approached by a parent concerned about her daughter, Claire, who had been ill since returning from Mexico. Meredith examined Claire, who resisted the exam and asked for antibiotics to go home. Meredith insisted on the exam and discovered scars from recent surgery. Claire admitted to having surgery in Mexico to hide it from her parents, and Meredith suspected a gastric bypass, ordering further tests.

Meanwhile, Digby Owens arrived with a gunshot wound, explaining he was shot by a friend as a favor and that he liked the scars as part of his philosophy about pain and commitment. Meredith and other staff discussed the flu spreading through the hospital. Cristina, despite feeling ill, insisted she needed a “kick-ass surgery” to get through the day. The interns continued to gossip about Meredith and Derek, debating the ethics and risks of sleeping with attendings. Cristina pointed out that recommendations from attendings like Shepherd could make or break their careers.

Derek Shepherd reviewed Jamie Hayes, a young girl with a brain abnormality and continuous seizure activity. Meredith briefed him on Jamie's condition, and Shepherd ordered new scans. The team discussed Digby Owens' gunshot wound and his philosophy about pain. Meredith and Bailey reviewed Claire's CT scans, confirming she had a gastric bypass, which was unusual for a non-obese college student. Bailey explained to Claire's mother that Claire would face lifelong malnutrition unless the procedure was reversed.

Jamie underwent further testing, and her parents worried about the cost and potential need for surgery. Shepherd explained Jamie's condition, Rasmussen's encephalitis, and the need to remove half her brain to save her life. The risks and possible outcomes were discussed with her parents. George was invited to scrub in on the hemispherectomy, exciting the other interns.

The interns continued to discuss Meredith's relationship with Shepherd. Izzie confronted Meredith about her choices, expressing frustration over the perceived advantages Meredith had due to her background and connections. Meredith insisted her relationship with Shepherd was not about getting ahead or surgeries.

During surgery, Dr. Taylor, the anesthesiologist, was suspected of drinking on the job after staff smelled alcohol on him. George raised concerns, and Taylor was defensive. During Jamie's surgery, Taylor nodded off, confirming suspicions about his impairment. Steph, a nurse, was asked to get coffee for Taylor, and Hopkins took over anesthesia until Dr. Pennington arrived.

Digby Owens' condition worsened due to sepsis from an infected tattoo, exacerbated by the gunshot wound. The medical team attempted to stabilize him but ultimately pronounced his time of death.

Claire's bypass was reversed, but she would suffer from short gut syndrome and lifelong nutritional challenges. Meredith discussed with Claire's parents the pressures Claire faced to please her mother. Claire's mother was confronted with the reality that Claire's actions stemmed from a desire for approval.

After the surgeries, Meredith, Cristina, and Izzie reflected on the day's events. Cristina, still sick, expressed her love for being a surgeon. Meredith joked about karma, noting that despite getting the best surgeries, she now smelled like “putrid goo.” Bailey asked which intern was clear to assist Shepherd, and Meredith volunteered.

Bailey and Shepherd discussed the code among doctors about not questioning each other's personal lives within the hospital. Bailey admitted she was out of line earlier, and Shepherd reassured her that she did the right thing.

Meredith checked on Claire, explaining that social services would contact her parents to help her adjust to her new reality. Meredith reflected on the difficulty of life and the tendency to bring trouble upon oneself.

At home, Meredith and Izzie had a candid conversation. Izzie criticized Meredith for risking her credibility over a relationship with Shepherd, pointing out their different backgrounds and the respect Meredith received effortlessly. Meredith insisted her relationship was not about career advancement. Izzie realized Meredith was falling for Shepherd, which Meredith denied, but Izzie teased her about it.

As the night ended, Meredith reflected on pain and the choices people make, suggesting that perhaps people are wired to seek pain because it makes them feel real. Cristina suggested they could sleep, and Meredith joked about the saying, “Why do I keep hitting myself with a hammer? Because it feels so good when I stop.”

Meredith Grey began the day reflecting on her childhood belief in fairy tales, recalling the hope for a perfect life with Prince Charming and a castle, and how growing up meant letting go of those dreams. In the kitchen, Izzie Stevens grew frustrated after baking for eight hours, eating chocolate and cupcakes but still feeling something was missing from her recipe. Meredith reassured Izzie that the cupcakes were good, while Cristina Yang joked that Martha Stewart would be proud. Izzie lamented her situation, and Meredith continued to muse about losing faith in childhood myths like Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy.

Cristina suggested that Izzie call her mother to ask about the missing ingredient, but Izzie refused. Cristina then proposed that they sleep at Izzie's house instead of Meredith's, questioning whether Meredith even had a home with personal belongings. Their conversation shifted as they arrived at the hospital, where Devo, a teenage patient, offered cupcakes to the staff and talked about her father's habits and her own health-conscious routines.

Cristina reviewed her schedule, trying to find someone to cover her shift on the 16th so she could undergo a medical procedure. The OB/GYN informed her that the earliest available appointment was the 16th and discussed options like adoption or keeping the baby, but Cristina was focused on scheduling a termination. She agreed to the 16th, acknowledging the difficulty of her decision.

Devo was evaluated by the neurology team after experiencing excessive bleeding following a root canal and developing a new heart murmur. She expressed fear of dying and asked about her parents, who were in the cafeteria. Dr. Bailey assured Devo that Dr. Karev would run labs and added a bleeding time to the tests. Alex Karev joked about Devo's name, and Devo explained her parents' drug use. Esther, another patient, introduced herself as Orthodox Jewish, and Karev teased her about her skirt.

Alex Karev brought another patient, Mr. Duff, to Cristina, claiming he belonged in psychiatry due to his seizures and visions. Cristina and Karev argued about whether Mr. Duff should be in neurology or psychiatry, with Cristina reading from his chart that he talked to dead people and had been committed by his family. Dr. Bailey said they could not return him to psychiatry until he was cleared. Meredith noted that Mr. Duff believed his seizures were visions, and Mr. Duff insisted he was psychic, predicting that someone would die on the fourth floor. Cristina and Meredith humored him and began neurological tests, during which Mr. Duff became dizzy and repeated his prediction.

Cristina continued seeking coverage for the 16th, asking George O'Malley, who was distracted by thoughts of growing his hair and stubble. Cristina was secretive about her reasons, and George pressed for personal details, but Cristina claimed she had no friends and was solely focused on surgery. Meredith interjected, wanting facts before getting involved, and Cristina encouraged her to be flexible.

Devo's test results indicated von Willebrand's disease, requiring a valve replacement. The attending doctor recommended a porcine (pig) valve, which Devo's family questioned due to religious concerns. Meanwhile, Mrs. Glass, another patient, was diagnosed with invasive carcinoma while pregnant. Dr. Jennings explained that treatment options—surgery, chemotherapy, radiation—would not allow the baby to survive, and the pregnancy hormones would accelerate the cancer. Mrs. Glass faced the choice between her own life and her baby's.

Mr. Walker, a patient who had fallen while rock climbing, experienced rapid paralysis with no clear MRI findings. Meredith and Dr. Bailey managed his intubation, with George O'Malley struggling but eventually succeeding after guidance. The team initially suspected a conversion reaction due to emotional trauma but ultimately decided to operate, trusting their instincts to find a clot in his spine.

Devo, facing religious objections to a pig valve, debated with her parents and the medical team. Izzie Stevens found an alternative: a bovine (cow) valve, which Dr. Burke confirmed was superior and longer-lasting, though more complex. Dr. Bailey reprimanded Karev for presenting the alternative without consulting her and removed him from the case.

Mr. Duff's MRI revealed an arteriovenous malformation in his temporal lobe, explaining his seizures and visions. Izzie pushed for surgery, but Meredith and Karev reminded her to follow protocol and obtain consent. Mr. Duff was skeptical about losing his psychic abilities after surgery, but the doctors reassured him about his prognosis.

Mrs. Glass and her husband decided to keep the baby despite the risks, rejecting the evacuation procedure. Mrs. Glass shared her family history of cancer and her resolve to choose happiness over treatment. Dr. Jennings called for a psychiatric consult, but Mrs. Glass declined, determined to proceed with her pregnancy.

Cristina confided in Dr. Burke about her uncertainty with the bovine valve procedure, and Burke advised her to research and seek assistance. Meredith and Derek Shepherd operated on Mr. Walker, searching for the elusive clot. The team faced complications, but Meredith persisted, eventually locating the clot and stopping the paralysis from advancing, though the permanence of his condition remained uncertain.

Devo requested a rabbi's blessing before surgery, and Dr. Bailey assigned Karev to fulfill the request. Dr. Chesney from the Cleveland Clinic assisted remotely with the bovine valve replacement, and the surgical team successfully completed the procedure.

George O'Malley was teased about his intubation mishap but was encouraged to pursue a romantic interest. The interns discussed relationships and living arrangements, with Izzie reflecting on her upbringing and her mother's reliance on psychics, questioning whether Mr. Duff's abilities were genuine.

Cricket, a patient recovering from paralysis, thanked the team for believing in him and demonstrated small improvements in movement. He shared a recipe tip with Izzie, revealing the missing ingredient—coconut extract—for her cupcakes. Cricket spoke about faith and the unpredictability of life, emphasizing happiness in the present rather than fairy-tale endings.

As the day ended, the characters shared personal details and moments of vulnerability. Meredith listened as a patient recounted his life story, including family, preferences, and quirks, ending with the notion that some things must be taken on faith. Meredith concluded that, once in a while, people will surprise you and even take your breath away.

Meredith Grey reflected on the nature of secrets and how the practice of medicine often brings hidden truths to light. Cristina Yang questioned Meredith about her relationship with Derek Shepherd, pressing for intimate details, while Izzie Stevens speculated that Meredith and Derek's connection went beyond casual sex. Derek admitted to Meredith that he barely knew her, and Meredith confessed that their relationship consisted mostly of nightly encounters. Cristina remained curious, and Izzie wondered aloud why Derek had left New York for Seattle. Derek, meanwhile, thanked Meredith for bringing him coffee.

Cristina then asked Dr. Miranda Bailey about the challenges of adoption and keeping a baby, but insisted she was not personally interested. George O'Malley, feeling emasculated by his friends, protested being treated like a sister. Alex Karev teased George about his lack of a sex life, and Cristina encouraged George to pursue a red-haired nurse. The nurse, Olivia Harper, responded flirtatiously to George's awkward attempt at conversation. When Meredith asked about Olivia, Richard Webber jokingly identified her as “Dad.” Meredith then inquired about a patient's diagnosis, and Webber revealed it was Alzheimer's disease, noting that Meredith was the only person allowed to visit the patient.

At home, Meredith found George locked in the bathroom. She needed to shower, but George insisted he would be out soon and claimed his activities were private. Meredith apologized for interrupting, and George insisted he was not doing what she thought. After George emerged, Meredith mused that people are rarely prepared when secrets are revealed.

Later that night, Miss Henry from the nursing home called Meredith about her mother. Meredith, startled, asked if her mother was all right, but Miss Henry said it was not urgent and hung up. When Izzie asked about the late call, Meredith lied and said it was a wrong number. Izzie then tried to reassure George about being caught in the bathroom, joking about his “imaginary girlfriend,” while George insisted his girlfriend was real. Meredith entered and asked what was happening, but George and Izzie brushed her off. Izzie teased George about being caught “playing with little Jimmy and the twins,” but George continued to protest his innocence.

At the hospital, Meredith refused to attend a counseling session, claiming she had already made her decision. Izzie told George she had paged him the previous night, but George was not on call. George mentioned Preston Burke, who quickly excused himself. Meredith continued to narrate about the burden of secrets.

George later approached Olivia Harper to say he had enjoyed their recent time together. Olivia reciprocated, but when George asked if she felt all right, she said she was fine. George admitted to feeling “a little itchy.” Izzie called George away, and Olivia greeted Izzie before leaving. Cristina and Izzie teased George about Olivia's interest in him. Meredith asked George if he really had not been doing anything in the bathroom, but George demanded an apology and left. George then asked Cristina to examine a rash, fearing it was syphilis. Cristina confirmed his suspicion.

Meanwhile, Meredith presented a patient with abdominal pain and blood in his urine. The initial tests were inconclusive, so a cystoscopy was ordered. Derek thanked Burke for his help, and the two reminisced about their fraternity days. Bailey warned them to be careful with their answers. During the procedure, Bailey joked with the patient, Bill, about the camera being inserted. They discovered a mass and took a biopsy. Burke determined that most of Bill's colon would need to be removed due to extensive damage.

George examined another patient, Mr. Franklin, who had abdominal swelling. Mrs. Franklin complained about the cost of tests, but George noted signs of liver disease and admitted Mr. Franklin for further evaluation. In the lab, George received his syphilis test results and was shocked to see they were positive. Alex asked who had syphilis, and George insisted it was not a surgical issue. Alex joked about Olivia's reputation, but George defended her. Cristina remarked that only the Amish were not promiscuous. Alex assured George that penicillin would cure him, but George worried about telling Olivia. Cristina insisted he had to tell her so she could get tested.

Bailey and the surgical team teased George about his syphilis diagnosis, joking about who had given him “cooties.” George refused to discuss his private life with the others. Meredith informed Mr. Franklin that he had ascites due to liver disease, and the family discussed his drinking habits. Alex and Izzie scheduled a paracentesis to relieve the pressure, and the attending surgeon instructed George and Izzie to perform the procedure themselves.

Lab results revealed that Bill's mass was actually an ovary, a result of chimerism. Bailey explained that Bill's body contained DNA from two embryos, resulting in gonadal hermaphroditism. Bill was shocked, but Burke and Alex reassured him. The team continued to joke about George's syphilis and Alex's reputation as a “player.”

Olivia invited George over after her shift, but George struggled to tell her about the syphilis. After stumbling over his words, he finally confessed. Meanwhile, Burke confided in Meredith about his vision problems and asked her to keep it secret, which Meredith agreed to do.

Patricia announced a syphilis outbreak among the hospital staff and demonstrated safe sex practices using a banana. Cristina and Burke discussed keeping the chief's surgery a secret, while Cristina and Meredith joked about relationship rules and syphilis testing.

During Mr. Franklin's paracentesis, he died unexpectedly. Burke and Dr. Knox reviewed the procedure and determined it had been performed correctly, but the family refused an autopsy. Cristina, Izzie, and Meredith decided to perform an unauthorized autopsy to clear themselves of blame. They snuck into the morgue at night, brought a textbook, and conducted the procedure. Bailey grew suspicious of their whereabouts.

Burke confronted Molly, Bill's wife, about her pregnancy, revealing that Bill was sterile and the baby could not be his. Molly refused to tell Bill the truth, but Burke insisted that Bill deserved to know. Meredith missed a family dinner for her mother due to surgery, and Miss Henry informed her that her mother had asked for her.

Meredith confided in Derek about her mother's Alzheimer's disease and admitted she had been lying to everyone about it. Bailey discovered the unauthorized autopsy and was furious, warning the interns of possible legal consequences. During the autopsy, they found that Mr. Franklin's heart was enlarged and filled with grainy material. Burke explained to the family that Mr. Franklin had died of hematomacrosis, a genetic blood disorder, not from complications of the procedure. The family realized the disease could affect their daughter Alice, and Burke recommended a blood test.

Olivia told George that she had been seeing Alex when she started dating George but broke it off when she realized she liked George more. George was upset to learn he had contracted syphilis from Olivia via Alex. A confrontation erupted between George and Alex, with Cristina, Izzie, and Meredith stepping in to break it up.

After a long day, Meredith and Cristina relaxed together, joking about drinking wine and making rules. Izzie apologized to Meredith, and Meredith reflected that once secrets are exposed, they no longer need to be hidden.

The episode concluded with the arrival of Dr. Addison Shepherd, who introduced herself to Meredith as Derek's wife, revealing that Meredith had been unknowingly involved with a married man and leaving her stunned.
