A speaker reflected on the nature of “the game,” explaining that some people have what it takes to play, while others do not. The speaker admitted feeling inadequate compared to their mother, who was considered one of the greats. In a house, Meredith Grey and Derek Shepherd interacted awkwardly after spending the night together. Meredith found the situation humiliating and urged Derek to leave because she was late for her first day of work. Their conversation revealed that the house belonged to Meredith's mother, Ellis Grey, who was still alive but had moved away from Boston, prompting Meredith to sell the house. They agreed not to exchange personal details. Meredith went upstairs to shower, telling Derek to be gone when she returned. Before parting, they confirmed each other's names.

Later, a group of new surgical interns gathered at Seattle Grace Hospital. Dr. Richard Webber addressed them, declaring that they were now doctors, not students, and warning them about the challenges ahead, including fierce competition and the possibility of failure. Dr. Webber emphasized that their performance was up to them. As the interns were called by name, Cristina Yang, George O'Malley, and others discussed the gender imbalance among the group and rumors that one intern was a model. They discovered they were assigned to a resident known as “the Nazi,” which made them apprehensive. George introduced himself to Meredith, referencing a previous meeting, and the group discussed Ellis Grey's reputation as a famous surgeon.

Dr. Miranda Bailey, their resident, introduced herself and laid out five strict rules, emphasizing discipline and hierarchy. She assigned tasks and warned the interns not to wake her unless a patient was dying. Soon after, a 15-year-old patient named Katie Bryce was brought in with seizures. The team worked quickly to stabilize her, and Dr. Preston Burke instructed Dr. Bailey to order a full battery of tests. Cristina was assigned to labs, George to patient work-ups, and Meredith to take Katie for a CT scan, making her responsible for the patient. Another intern, Alex Karev, was assigned rectal exams.

Cristina informed Dr. Bailey that Katie's labs were clear and mentioned a rumor that the best intern would get to perform a procedure on the first shift. Dr. Bailey dismissed her. Meanwhile, Izzie Stevens, another intern, reassured a patient about upcoming bypass surgery. Meredith, lost in the hospital, checked on Katie, who was upset about missing her beauty pageant. Meredith and Katie discussed the pageant and Katie's talent, rhythmic gymnastics. Katie was sarcastic and difficult with Meredith.

The interns gathered in the break room, where Alex complained about performing seventeen rectal exams and feeling disliked by Dr. Bailey. The group discussed Meredith's famous mother and the pressure of living up to her reputation. They joked about wanting a good case, and Meredith complained about Katie. Dr. Burke then announced that George would have the honor of performing the first surgery, an appendectomy. The other interns were skeptical about George's abilities. Dr. Burke and Dr. Webber discussed George, noting that he barely made it into the program and was being set up to fail as an example.

Meredith checked on Katie and her parents, who had questions about her condition. Meredith deferred to the attending, Dr. Shepherd, who turned out to be Derek from the previous night. Meredith and Derek awkwardly discussed their prior encounter and agreed to keep it secret. Meredith insisted that their personal history could not affect their professional relationship. Derek joked about taking advantage of each other and asked her out again, but Meredith refused, citing their new roles.

The interns watched as George prepared to perform the appendectomy under Dr. Burke's supervision. They bet on whether he would succeed or fail. George began the surgery and initially performed well, but then made a mistake, causing complications. Dr. Burke took over and called George a “pansy-ass idiot.” The other interns nicknamed George “007,” meaning “license to kill.” George was upset about the nickname, and although his peers denied it, he knew it was spreading.

Cristina received a page about Katie and left. George lamented his failure and considered switching specialties. Meredith expressed frustration about living with her mother. Meredith was paged to Katie's room, where Katie had faked an emergency out of boredom. Meredith scolded her and told her to sleep. Cristina asked Izzie for help starting a central line on a patient. They considered waking Dr. Bailey, but when they did, Dr. Bailey was angry and warned them not to wake her again unless the patient was near death. Cristina was given samples to take to the lab.

Alex discussed a post-op patient with possible pneumonia and insisted on antibiotics despite a nurse's questions. Alex introduced himself and made a sexist remark, mistaking Izzie for a nurse. George awkwardly tried to befriend Meredith. Suddenly, Katie began having multiple grand mal seizures. The team tried various medications, but nothing worked. Meredith was pressured to make decisions. Katie's heart stopped, and the team performed a code blue. After several attempts, they revived her. Dr. Bailey scolded Meredith for not paging her immediately. Katie's parents confronted Dr. Shepherd about the lack of a diagnosis, and Mr. Bryce demanded a more competent doctor.

Meanwhile, Mr. Savitch was prepared for bypass surgery. His wife, Gloria Savitch, was reassured by Izzie, who promised a good outcome. Dr. Burke admonished Izzie for making promises to patients' families. Dr. Shepherd gathered the interns and asked for their help diagnosing Katie, offering the incentive of assisting in surgery to whoever found the answer. Dr. Bailey distributed Katie's chart, and the interns began working on the case. Cristina and Meredith agreed to work together, with Meredith declining the opportunity to assist in surgery if they succeeded. They reviewed possible diagnoses and eliminated several options. Meredith confided in Cristina that she had slept with Dr. Shepherd. They continued brainstorming but ran out of ideas. Meredith realized that Katie's minor fall during rhythmic gymnastics practice could have caused a rare aneurysm.

Meredith and Cristina presented their theory to Dr. Shepherd, who was initially skeptical. Meredith explained that Katie's minor fall could have ruptured an undetected aneurysm. They performed an angiogram and discovered a small subarachnoid hemorrhage. Dr. Shepherd praised their work and told Meredith she would assist in the surgery. Dr. Burke informed Izzie that Mr. Savitch's heart was too damaged for bypass surgery and he died. Izzie was upset, having promised the patient's wife a good outcome. Dr. Burke reprimanded her for making promises and instructed her to deliver the bad news. Izzie delivered the news to Gloria Savitch, who was devastated and asked Izzie to leave.

Izzie helped Katie prepare for surgery, fulfilling a promise to make her look “cool.” Meredith asked Dr. Shepherd if she was chosen for the surgery because they had slept together. He joked, then assured her she earned it by helping save Katie's life. He encouraged her not to let their personal history interfere with her career. George and Izzie reflected on their career choices and the expectations of their families. George felt inadequate, while Izzie recalled being discouraged by her mother. They agreed that being seen as a “superhero” was not so bad and wondered if they would survive the internship.

Dr. Webber questioned Alex about a post-op patient with shortness of breath. Alex was unable to answer, but Meredith correctly identified the five common causes of post-op fever and suggested the patient might have a pulmonary embolus. Dr. Webber instructed Alex to follow Meredith's recommendations and recognized her as Ellis Grey's daughter, welcoming her to the profession.

Dr. Shepherd prepared for Katie's surgery, telling the team it was a beautiful night to save lives. Meredith reflected on the challenges of being a surgeon and the reasons to quit, but admitted to loving the work despite its difficulties. After surgery, Meredith and Dr. Shepherd agreed not to have an emotional conversation. Meredith and Cristina exchanged banter about their appearance and exhaustion. George expressed excitement after assisting in surgery, describing the experience as a high. He and Izzie agreed that surgery was exhilarating. Meredith reflected on surviving the first shift along with the other interns. She decided to keep her mother's house and considered getting roommates. Finally, Meredith visited her mother, Ellis Grey, who was in a care facility and did not recognize her. Meredith gently reminded her mother that she was a surgeon.
