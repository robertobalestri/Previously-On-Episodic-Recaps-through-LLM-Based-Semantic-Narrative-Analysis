Meredith Grey began her first day as a surgical intern by waking up next to Derek Shepherd after a one-night stand. Embarrassed and anxious about being late, Meredith urged Derek to leave her house, insisting on keeping things impersonal despite his attempts at friendliness. During their awkward conversation, Meredith revealed she had just moved from Boston and was in the process of selling her mother's house.

At the hospital, Meredith joined a group of new surgical interns. Dr. Richard Webber addressed the group, warning them that not all would make it through the program. Dr. Miranda Bailey, known as "The Nazi," introduced herself as their resident and laid out her five strict rules for survival: no sucking up, answer every page at a run, never wake her unless a patient is dying, do not let the patient be dead when she arrives, and always move when she moves.

Meredith met her fellow interns: Cristina Yang, George O'Malley, and Izzie Stevens. George nervously tried to befriend the others, while Cristina's competitive nature was immediately apparent. Izzie's background as a former model drew skepticism from the group, but she remained determined to prove herself.

Their first patient was Katie Bryce, a 15-year-old pageant contestant suffering from unexplained seizures. Dr. Bailey assigned Cristina to run labs, George to do patient workups, Meredith to oversee Katie and take her for a CT scan, and Izzie to perform rectal exams. Meredith struggled to connect with Katie, who was distraught about missing her pageant, but Meredith persisted in her duties despite exhaustion.

As the interns worked together, they gossiped about Meredith's mother, Ellis Grey, a legendary surgeon. Cristina expressed envy at Meredith's lineage, while George remained unaware of Ellis's reputation.

Dr. Bailey announced that George had been chosen to perform the first surgery, an appendectomy, as a test of his skills. The other interns placed bets on his success. In the operating room, George started confidently but panicked when a complication arose. Dr. Burke took over the surgery, and George was left humiliated, earning the nickname "007" from his peers.

Katie's condition deteriorated, and she suffered a cardiac arrest. Meredith and the team struggled to revive her, finally succeeding after several attempts. Dr. Shepherd and Dr. Burke criticized the interns for not paging them sooner. Katie's parents, distraught and desperate for answers, confronted Dr. Shepherd, who admitted he did not yet know the cause of her seizures.

Meanwhile, Dr. Burke performed heart surgery on another patient, Tony Savage, but the patient died due to extensive heart damage. Cristina and George were shaken, especially after having reassured the family. Dr. Bailey reminded them never to promise good outcomes to patients' families.

Dr. Shepherd gathered the interns and challenged them to help diagnose Katie, promising that whoever solved the case could assist in her surgery. Meredith and Cristina teamed up, and Meredith confided in Cristina about her night with Dr. Shepherd, explaining her reluctance to work with him. Together, they reviewed Katie's history and realized that a minor fall during a pageant rehearsal could have caused a rare brain aneurysm. They presented their findings to Dr. Shepherd, who confirmed a subarachnoid hemorrhage and prepared for surgery.

Dr. Shepherd chose Meredith to assist in the surgery, explaining that she had earned the right by helping save Katie's life. Though hesitant because of their personal history, Meredith agreed to participate. Cristina was disappointed but accepted Meredith's decision.

After the surgery, the interns reflected on their challenging first day. George lamented his failures, while Cristina recalled her mother's doubts about her abilities. Meredith decided to keep her mother's house and considered finding roommates. She visited Ellis Grey, who now suffered from memory loss and did not recognize her. Meredith gently reminded her mother of her past as a surgeon.

As the episode ended, Meredith reflected on the difficulties and pressures of being a surgeon, but also on her love for the work. The interns, exhausted but resilient, had survived their first shift and began to form bonds as they faced the challenges ahead.
