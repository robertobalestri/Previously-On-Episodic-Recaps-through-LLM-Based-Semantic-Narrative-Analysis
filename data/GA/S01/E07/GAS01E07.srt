1
00:00:01,145 --> 00:00:02,908
Previously on Grey's Anatomy.

2
00:00:02,928 --> 00:00:05,235
I've had this thing from my roommate since, like, day one.

3
00:00:05,394 --> 00:00:07,440
And I just, I can't tell her.

4
00:00:08,663 --> 00:00:10,125
Wouldn't it be easier to just ask her out?

5
00:00:10,768 --> 00:00:12,913
Are you really as shallow and callous as you seem?

6
00:00:13,855 --> 00:00:17,905
Oh, you want to go out for a drink later and hear about my secret pain?

7
00:00:17,986 --> 00:00:18,547
I can't.

8
00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:19,547
I'm seeing someone.

9
00:00:19,568 --> 00:00:21,010
Save yourself the misery, man.

10
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,192
She's off the market.

11
00:00:22,332 --> 00:00:22,512
What?

12
00:00:22,713 --> 00:00:23,253
But she's not.

13
00:00:23,272 --> 00:00:25,196
I mean, if she was seeing someone, I live with her.

14
00:00:25,335 --> 00:00:25,856
I would know it.

15
00:00:25,937 --> 00:00:37,332
And the longer this little fling goes on, the more favors you get over the others who are fighting to the nail just to make it through this program when those people start finding out what's going on.

16
00:00:37,713 --> 00:00:39,576
What is this that we're doing here?

17
00:00:40,296 --> 00:00:41,378
You need a definition?

18
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:47,807
The next time I see you favoring Meredith Gray in any way, I'll make sure she doesn't see the inside of an OR for a month.

19
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:59,119
Okay, anyone who says you can sleep when you die, tell them to come talk to me after a few months as an intern.

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,245
Of course, it's not just the job that keeps us up all night.

21
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:08,971
You have to get up now.

22
00:01:08,992 --> 00:01:09,972
What?

23
00:01:09,992 --> 00:01:13,378
My God, what time is it?

24
00:01:13,397 --> 00:01:13,998
It's 5.20.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,320
And I have three rounds.

26
00:01:18,384 --> 00:01:19,825
And you have to leave before they see you.

27
00:01:20,066 --> 00:01:21,608
Oh, come on now.

28
00:01:22,144 --> 00:01:24,408
Why don't you just let him sleep?

29
00:01:24,427 --> 00:01:24,487
No.

30
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:24,828
Please.

31
00:01:24,908 --> 00:01:27,251
No, no.

32
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:28,152
You get any sleep?

33
00:01:30,093 --> 00:01:33,757
She could boil the bed screens as a courtesy or at least buy a padded headboard.

34
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,162
So who's the guy?

35
00:01:37,763 --> 00:01:39,584
You think it was just one guy doing all that work?

36
00:01:39,745 --> 00:01:40,064
Yeah.

37
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:41,266
Do you mind if I don't think about that?

38
00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:43,028
Oh, jelly.

39
00:01:43,048 --> 00:01:44,510
You're not jealous.

40
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,051
Well, I am.

41
00:01:45,912 --> 00:01:48,034
At least I know she'll be having a long day at work.

42
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,081
Well, at least we know brain surgery isn't his only skill.

43
00:02:05,102 --> 00:02:05,903
It can't be.

44
00:02:05,923 --> 00:02:06,683
He's her boss.

45
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:07,784
We're late.

46
00:02:08,506 --> 00:02:09,546
He's all of our boss.

47
00:02:11,429 --> 00:02:14,072
You know, she has been scrubbing in a lot lately on his surgeries.

48
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:14,151
No.

49
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,674
Meredith wouldn't sleep with him.

50
00:02:15,713 --> 00:02:16,294
Just no.

51
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:18,637
Well, if she's not ashamed of it, why is she keeping it a secret?

52
00:02:19,157 --> 00:02:19,777
Maybe she didn't.

53
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:21,819
Maybe it just happened.

54
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:25,283
You know, spontaneously last night.

55
00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:27,045
Hi.

56
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:27,806
Good morning.

57
00:02:27,885 --> 00:02:28,467
Morning.

58
00:02:30,168 --> 00:02:32,700
Hey, so it sounded like you were having some pretty radical sex last night.

59
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:33,626
All night long.

60
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:34,973
Who's the guy?

61
00:02:35,837 --> 00:02:36,701
No one you know.

62
00:02:38,503 --> 00:02:38,965
We're late.

63
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:39,425
Let's go.

64
00:02:39,585 --> 00:02:44,350
I mean, if life's so hard already, why do we bring more trouble down on ourselves?

65
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:47,394
What's up with the need to hit the self-destruct button?

66
00:02:47,413 --> 00:02:47,814
Yikes.

67
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:50,037
Wouldn't want to meet you in a dark alley.

68
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:50,897
Right back at you.

69
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:51,799
Oh, run?

70
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,961
You run?

71
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,981
Every day, babe.

72
00:02:54,002 --> 00:02:54,902
Every day.

73
00:02:54,923 --> 00:02:55,924
Not suffering enough?

74
00:02:57,126 --> 00:02:58,606
Doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.

75
00:02:58,687 --> 00:02:58,927
Oh, come on.

76
00:02:58,967 --> 00:03:00,930
Don't go acting all indefatigable crap.

77
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:02,170
You're dragging like the rest of us.

78
00:03:02,451 --> 00:03:03,853
Oh, what is that?

79
00:03:03,872 --> 00:03:05,414
Confession of weakness, Dr. Yang?

80
00:03:05,655 --> 00:03:06,757
It's called the flu.

81
00:03:06,977 --> 00:03:07,076
Yeah.

82
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:10,286
I'm gonna need a major rush to make it through this day.

83
00:03:11,706 --> 00:03:13,308
I need a kick-ass surgery.

84
00:03:13,348 --> 00:03:14,651
You a bad boy last night, George?

85
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:15,972
That would be Meredith.

86
00:03:17,032 --> 00:03:19,695
You a bad boy, Meredith?

87
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:20,197
Do tell.

88
00:03:20,257 --> 00:03:21,717
Nothing to tell.

89
00:03:21,777 --> 00:03:24,842
Well, it says it all, huh?

90
00:03:24,861 --> 00:03:26,503
Sorry, I have a sex life.

91
00:03:26,644 --> 00:03:27,724
Don't apologize.

92
00:03:27,944 --> 00:03:28,746
Embrace it.

93
00:03:29,146 --> 00:03:29,646
Share it.

94
00:03:30,768 --> 00:03:31,229
Count me in.

95
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:33,091
Yeah.

96
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:36,675
Next time, just let me know if I need to go to a hotel so I can get some sleep.

97
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:40,123
Am I missing something?

98
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:40,884
Just a little loud.

99
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:48,752
Do they know it's McDreamy keeping them up all night?

100
00:03:48,772 --> 00:03:49,413
I hope not.

101
00:03:49,873 --> 00:03:51,194
I already have Bailey riding me.

102
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,038
I don't need my roommates thinking I'm getting special treatment.

103
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,264
O'Malley, Yang, Karev, go on to clinic.

104
00:04:02,445 --> 00:04:04,467
O'Malley, patients are waiting.

105
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:06,401
You two come with me.

106
00:04:06,801 --> 00:04:08,245
Izzy, you're hanging with me today.

107
00:04:08,786 --> 00:04:10,590
Good morning, Dr. Shepherd.

108
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:10,971
Dr. Bailey.

109
00:04:15,442 --> 00:04:16,904
Late night, Gray.

110
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:19,805
No, caffeine just hasn't kicked in yet.

111
00:04:19,985 --> 00:04:23,091
If you're at all religious, you would want to start praying it kicks in soon.

112
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,653
There's a consult in the pit.

113
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,675
A girl with a fever and abdominal pain.

114
00:04:27,076 --> 00:04:30,060
After that, Nicholas in 3311 needs his meds.

115
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,684
Mr. Mowers' IV fell out, and he's a hard stick.

116
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:36,910
Post stops in 1337, 3342, 3363, and 2381.

117
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,112
3381.

118
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,973
33-42, 33-63, and 23-81.

119
00:04:42,052 --> 00:04:51,444
Why are you still standing in front of me?

120
00:04:51,463 --> 00:04:53,165
You look more like me than you right now.

121
00:04:53,206 --> 00:04:53,786
What's the matter?

122
00:04:54,247 --> 00:04:54,608
Nothing.

123
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:55,108
Help.

124
00:04:55,468 --> 00:04:57,271
I need immediate help.

125
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:57,911
What's the problem?

126
00:04:57,932 --> 00:05:01,076
My damn boyfriend swallowed my keys.

127
00:05:01,096 --> 00:05:02,858
I didn't want her to leave.

128
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,062
Locate the lady's keys.

129
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:09,827
I think she got some bug on her trip to Mexico with her friends.

130
00:05:10,348 --> 00:05:13,713
I told her not to go to a third world country, but does she ever listen?

131
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,398
She's been weak ever since, and she's lost weight.

132
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:17,720
Barely.

133
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:19,923
And this morning, she passed out in the shower.

134
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:24,189
When was the trip?

135
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:25,091
A couple weeks ago.

136
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:26,274
I'm really fine.

137
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:27,134
I just have a fever.

138
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:31,141
OK, well, will you lie back for an exam for me?

139
00:05:32,343 --> 00:05:32,944
No, please.

140
00:05:33,262 --> 00:05:34,423
I don't need an exam.

141
00:05:34,963 --> 00:05:37,646
Just give me some antibiotics and send me home.

142
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,309
Well, maybe it is just a fever.

143
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,153
But they called down for a surgeon, so I have to give the OK to let you go.

144
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:46,437
So just let me do the exam.

145
00:05:50,002 --> 00:05:50,562
Do the exam.

146
00:05:51,363 --> 00:05:51,625
No.

147
00:05:54,127 --> 00:05:54,889
This is crazy.

148
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:55,610
I'm fine.

149
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:59,134
For God's sake, Claire, I don't want to spend my entire day here.

150
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:05,939
You know, actually, Mrs. Rice, this might be easier if we had some privacy.

151
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,702
So would you two mind leaving the room?

152
00:06:09,483 --> 00:06:14,949
That's fine.

153
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:15,370
Digby.

154
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,271
Digby Owens.

155
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:20,336
I have an appointment.

156
00:06:20,355 --> 00:06:20,956
Excuse me, sir.

157
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:22,158
You're bleeding.

158
00:06:22,178 --> 00:06:23,139
Do you mind if I?

159
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,860
Sure, sure.

160
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:24,701
Have a look.

161
00:06:26,584 --> 00:06:27,305
That's a gunshot.

162
00:06:27,824 --> 00:06:27,925
Yeah.

163
00:06:27,944 --> 00:06:28,987
We got a gunshot wound.

164
00:06:29,007 --> 00:06:30,267
We got to get him down to pit.

165
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:32,468
I'm sorry.

166
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:32,949
I'm sorry.

167
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:36,817
Mr. Dickby, all right, but just remember, see, look, I scheduled this.

168
00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:38,019
What, gunshot?

169
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,461
Yeah, my buddy shot me.

170
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:39,843
Your buddy?

171
00:06:40,202 --> 00:06:41,565
Yeah, just as a favor.

172
00:06:41,826 --> 00:06:42,267
On purpose?

173
00:06:42,288 --> 00:06:42,728
Hell, yeah.

174
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:44,692
I mean, he wasn't trying to hurt me or nothing, but you know.

175
00:06:44,992 --> 00:06:45,434
But why?

176
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:47,497
I like the scars.

177
00:07:17,684 --> 00:07:21,250
Look, everyone in town has tats, but my art is about commitment.

178
00:07:21,752 --> 00:07:23,596
So this is your art, huh?

179
00:07:23,615 --> 00:07:24,396
Damn straight.

180
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:26,180
Damn stupid.

181
00:07:26,201 --> 00:07:27,483
The bullet went all the way through.

182
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:29,146
Bounced off my ribs.

183
00:07:29,547 --> 00:07:31,451
I have another one still in my shoulder.

184
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,093
Nice, huh?

185
00:07:34,596 --> 00:07:35,980
You could hang it in the Louvre.

186
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:38,252
I have an ethos.

187
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:41,896
Why do anything unless you're willing to go one step further than anybody else?

188
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,077
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right?

189
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:44,939
Exactly.

190
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,740
And pain is the great divide.

191
00:07:47,242 --> 00:07:50,004
My coach used to say it's all about how we process pain.

192
00:07:50,505 --> 00:07:51,447
Football?

193
00:07:51,466 --> 00:07:52,567
Wrestling, Iowa State.

194
00:07:53,228 --> 00:07:53,930
Iowa?

195
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:54,110
141.

196
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:55,492
157.

197
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:57,593
Well, you gotta be more than 180 now.

198
00:07:57,994 --> 00:07:59,716
I'd like to see you get back under 145.

199
00:08:00,476 --> 00:08:05,442
Excuse me, but thinking of you men in tights makes me want to puke.

200
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,084
There's a flu going around the hospital.

201
00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:09,625
Somewhat ironic.

202
00:08:13,112 --> 00:08:13,232
Ow.

203
00:08:15,654 --> 00:08:16,697
Don't push so hard.

204
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:33,523
Can you lift your shirt so I can examine your stomach?

205
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:45,457
Where did you get these?

206
00:08:45,499 --> 00:08:52,789
There.

207
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:54,212
You've had surgery recently.

208
00:08:54,874 --> 00:08:56,135
These scars are still pink.

209
00:08:57,378 --> 00:08:58,419
Don't tell my parents.

210
00:08:59,981 --> 00:09:05,250
You did this in Mexico so your parents wouldn't know?

211
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,091
What did you have done?

212
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:15,769
And you noticed her foot twitching?

213
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:16,571
Come on, Jamie.

214
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:18,855
Oh, yeah.

215
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,157
About three months ago?

216
00:09:20,397 --> 00:09:21,057
Just a little.

217
00:09:21,619 --> 00:09:26,807
We took her to county hospital, and she got the CT scan, which showed her brain abnormality.

218
00:09:27,207 --> 00:09:27,908
Here, you can put it.

219
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,851
And the twitching has gotten worse.

220
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:30,812
A lot worse.

221
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,918
They just don't have the proper equipment back home to figure out what's wrong.

222
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,342
You did a good thing.

223
00:09:37,803 --> 00:09:39,066
Yes, your mommy.

224
00:09:40,024 --> 00:09:44,452
Okay, you did a good thing by coming all this way, Mr. and Mrs. Hayes.

225
00:09:44,472 --> 00:09:45,754
You sit tight, Jamie, okay?

226
00:09:46,355 --> 00:09:49,120
I'm gonna bring in Dr. Shepherd to see you, okay?

227
00:09:49,642 --> 00:09:51,085
Dr. Shepherd, okay?

228
00:09:51,846 --> 00:09:53,008
He's the brain specialist.

229
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:54,370
To Mommy.

230
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,931
To Mommy and Daddy.

231
00:09:54,951 --> 00:09:58,037
Doctor, is he good, this Dr. Shepherd?

232
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,902
At just about everything,

233
00:10:03,464 --> 00:10:07,671
I assume the lady needs her keys to leave this guy's sorry ass behind.

234
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:08,993
Yeah.

235
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:11,177
Well, how about?

236
00:10:11,197 --> 00:10:12,178
He needs a bronchoscopy.

237
00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:13,961
So you want to do one, teach one.

238
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:14,682
You've seen one.

239
00:10:14,743 --> 00:10:15,464
It's time to do one.

240
00:10:16,205 --> 00:10:16,485
Alone?

241
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:17,967
Seriously?

242
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:19,009
Thanks.

243
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:20,913
I mean, the vote of confidence in my skills and all.

244
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:24,298
I didn't think you, well, anyone was noticing how hard I have been working with you.

245
00:10:24,318 --> 00:10:24,538
Easy.

246
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,000
Go.

247
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:26,065
You paged?

248
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:26,606
Where are we?

249
00:10:27,048 --> 00:10:30,136
I did the consult, did the IV, the meds, the post-ops, everything.

250
00:10:30,216 --> 00:10:31,019
How's your pit patient?

251
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:33,206
She's febrile and has peritoneal signs.

252
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:34,649
You all right, Dr. Yang?

253
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,796
Fine.

254
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:38,279
On my way back to clinic.

255
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:41,224
I think she had some sort of illegal surgery done in Mexico.

256
00:10:41,544 --> 00:10:42,265
Botched abortion?

257
00:10:42,485 --> 00:10:42,706
No.

258
00:10:42,806 --> 00:10:46,671
She has four laparoscopic scars on her abdomen and won't say what they're from.

259
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:47,772
And the parents are clueless.

260
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:48,393
She's a minor.

261
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:50,115
17, freshman in college.

262
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:51,376
You order her up for a CT?

263
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:51,736
Yes.

264
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,642
So while she's there, the nurses couldn't get a Foley on Mr. Garay.

265
00:10:55,701 --> 00:10:58,004
He may need a cadet cath if you can't get a normal one in there.

266
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:02,870
Write up post-op notes on all surgical floor patients that are esky surgery within the last 24 hours.

267
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,054
Be sure to document their EKGs and x-rays.

268
00:11:06,455 --> 00:11:07,996
Hunt them down if you can't find them.

269
00:11:07,976 --> 00:11:08,618
Right away.

270
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:10,038
Hey.

271
00:11:10,058 --> 00:11:10,519
Whoa.

272
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,725
You got the flu?

273
00:11:16,065 --> 00:11:17,186
Yeah, and thanks for it.

274
00:11:17,206 --> 00:11:18,527
It's making my life so much easier.

275
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:20,249
I didn't give it to you.

276
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:21,289
It's all over the hospital.

277
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:22,991
You should be in bed.

278
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:26,475
Disease diagnosis and prescription from one man.

279
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:28,817
Seriously, I'll give you a ride home.

280
00:11:29,418 --> 00:11:30,818
This is not going to make me go home.

281
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:32,140
You go home.

282
00:11:33,422 --> 00:11:34,423
But I feel fine.

283
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:43,870
Hey, hey, hey, have you seen Shepard?

284
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,832
Not as up close as Meredith has.

285
00:11:46,614 --> 00:11:46,715
What?

286
00:11:46,735 --> 00:11:47,696
Are you trying to get her in trouble?

287
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:48,418
She's our friend.

288
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:51,842
George, this program will make or break our careers, OK?

289
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:53,746
Some of us will make it through, and some of us won't.

290
00:11:53,807 --> 00:11:57,953
And that decision depends entirely on recommendations from doctors like Shepard.

291
00:11:58,674 --> 00:12:00,518
There is a reason we don't sleep with the attendants.

292
00:12:00,538 --> 00:12:01,620
It's not her fault it's Shepard's.

293
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,562
He's the attending.

294
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:03,403
He should know better.

295
00:12:03,663 --> 00:12:04,745
He's taking advantage of her.

296
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:07,971
Didn't exactly sound like anything was happening against her will last night.

297
00:12:27,307 --> 00:12:27,947
Here you go, Doc.

298
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:30,110
The kid's CTs just arrived from county.

299
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:30,532
Thanks.

300
00:12:30,692 --> 00:12:31,092
Excuse me.

301
00:12:31,494 --> 00:12:32,134
Sorry, Dr. Taylor.

302
00:12:34,597 --> 00:12:35,360
That would be bourbon.

303
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:36,581
What?

304
00:12:37,243 --> 00:12:37,903
I smelled it too.

305
00:12:39,546 --> 00:12:41,688
And he's the best anesthesiologist on the staff.

306
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,714
I'll worry when he's too juiced to do his crossword puzzle.

307
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:53,928
Can you close up for me?

308
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:55,490
Thank you, everyone.

309
00:12:58,711 --> 00:12:59,451
Dr. Shepherd.

310
00:12:59,491 --> 00:13:00,413
I gotta get some coffee.

311
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,456
Jamie Hayes has been admitted.

312
00:13:02,755 --> 00:13:04,317
The little girl with the brain abnormality?

313
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:05,078
How's she presenting?

314
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:08,722
She has what looks like continuous seizure activity in her left foot.

315
00:13:09,724 --> 00:13:10,524
Her balance is off.

316
00:13:10,544 --> 00:13:12,508
Her parents have come a long way to try to find out what's wrong.

317
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:14,110
How old are these?

318
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:15,030
They're three months old.

319
00:13:15,051 --> 00:13:15,571
I need new ones.

320
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:17,173
Her brain could look dramatically different today.

321
00:13:19,475 --> 00:13:19,716
OK.

322
00:13:20,096 --> 00:13:20,618
I'll order them.

323
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:22,139
Thank you.

324
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:27,826
Doc.

325
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:28,346
And that?

326
00:13:28,985 --> 00:13:30,988
That's a bullet from a previous gunshot.

327
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:32,470
Previous gunshot, OK.

328
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:33,971
No reason to take it out.

329
00:13:34,172 --> 00:13:35,634
No, guy likes pain.

330
00:13:35,653 --> 00:13:36,335
It's his ethos.

331
00:13:36,836 --> 00:13:37,677
Pain is an ethos.

332
00:13:38,738 --> 00:13:43,183
Wait, I think I know this guy.

333
00:13:43,203 --> 00:13:44,024
You remember this guy?

334
00:13:45,187 --> 00:13:46,749
Hey, the tattooed masochist.

335
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:48,311
Had himself shot again.

336
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:50,514
Glad to see he's still stupid.

337
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:50,995
It's his ethos.

338
00:13:51,775 --> 00:13:53,177
Let's go tell him what he gets to do today.

339
00:13:53,597 --> 00:13:56,903
Dr. Bailey, Claire Rice's abdominal CTs.

340
00:13:57,724 --> 00:13:58,705
Is this girl fat?

341
00:13:59,106 --> 00:13:59,648
Not at all.

342
00:13:59,668 --> 00:14:00,909
She's a normal college kid.

343
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:02,611
So what do you see?

344
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:04,875
Her stomach's stapled.

345
00:14:05,736 --> 00:14:07,078
She's had a gastric bypass.

346
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:12,267
And a bad one at that.

347
00:14:12,288 --> 00:14:17,195
Gastric bypass is a procedure normally done on obese patients to help them lose weight.

348
00:14:18,537 --> 00:14:18,937
Claire?

349
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,140
She doesn't need to lose weight.

350
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:21,881
Are you kidding?

351
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:24,186
This means the world to her.

352
00:14:24,841 --> 00:14:27,524
But it is so typical of this girl to take the easy way out.

353
00:14:27,563 --> 00:14:29,807
She's done it with everything since she was a little kid.

354
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:30,346
Ms.

355
00:14:30,407 --> 00:14:32,549
Rice, nothing about this is going to be easy.

356
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:37,414
She's going to face a lifelong struggle with malnutrition unless she has surgery to reverse the procedure.

357
00:14:37,895 --> 00:14:38,696
Do the surgery.

358
00:14:40,158 --> 00:14:42,139
I told her to watch the freshman 15.

359
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,383
Don't eat junk, exercise.

360
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:50,470
But when she came home Christmas, who had to take her out and buy her a brand new pair of size 6 jeans because she couldn't get in the ones I got her last summer?

361
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,633
Tina, you know, she tries so hard.

362
00:14:54,575 --> 00:14:56,216
She gets good grades.

363
00:14:56,236 --> 00:14:57,038
She gets A's.

364
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,662
She has illegal surgery in Mexico.

365
00:15:00,744 --> 00:15:04,328
Unfortunately, there were complications with the bypass.

366
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:06,251
What do you mean?

367
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:13,121
She has what looks like an abscess under her diaphragm and edema, which is a swelling of the bowel wall.

368
00:15:13,741 --> 00:15:15,605
I can't say for certain she'll recover completely.

369
00:15:18,408 --> 00:15:21,813
Just do whatever you have to do to make her well, okay?

370
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,253
You look like a princess.

371
00:15:26,312 --> 00:15:27,215
Do you know you're a princess?

372
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,120
It's not lipstick.

373
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,903
It's not lipstick?

374
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:32,265
No, it's not lipstick.

375
00:15:32,285 --> 00:15:33,649
Want to do my shoulder?

376
00:15:33,668 --> 00:15:34,711
Oh, good.

377
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:34,932
Thank you.

378
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:35,833
And your nose.

379
00:15:35,854 --> 00:15:38,440
We're going to find out what's causing the seizures.

380
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,023
Does MRI know we're coming down?

381
00:15:40,043 --> 00:15:40,845
You said CT.

382
00:15:42,087 --> 00:15:42,849
Now I'm saying MRI.

383
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,033
It's available.

384
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:48,154
Doctor, is she gonna need surgery?

385
00:15:48,796 --> 00:15:49,275
I don't know yet.

386
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:53,541
It's just that my wife and I, we both work, and I don't know... We know it can be very expensive.

387
00:15:53,861 --> 00:15:54,883
I don't want you to worry about that.

388
00:15:58,086 --> 00:15:59,128
It's a focal left-side seizure.

389
00:15:59,148 --> 00:16:01,190
Okay, let's get that diazepam running right now, please.

390
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:01,571
Diazepam IV.

391
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:02,312
Okay, tourniquet, please.

392
00:16:02,972 --> 00:16:03,192
Tourniquet.

393
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,494
Hey, Jamie, here's what we're gonna do.

394
00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:06,636
We're gonna put this on your arm, okay?

395
00:16:07,337 --> 00:16:07,878
Isn't that fun?

396
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:10,360
We're gonna put that right there like that.

397
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,403
This is gonna feel cold.

398
00:16:12,283 --> 00:16:13,485
This is a butterfly.

399
00:16:14,461 --> 00:16:15,422
Butterfly lands right there.

400
00:16:16,524 --> 00:16:16,864
There we go.

401
00:16:16,884 --> 00:16:17,664
Blanket for the butterfly.

402
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:17,905
Good.

403
00:16:17,966 --> 00:16:18,566
Nicely done.

404
00:16:23,673 --> 00:16:28,298
It's amazing stuff, isn't it?

405
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:29,240
Hey, you like spaceships?

406
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:30,322
You do?

407
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:31,082
OK.

408
00:16:31,263 --> 00:16:35,509
Should we take Captain O'Malley, my first lieutenant, to the spaceship MRI?

409
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:36,509
Let's go.

410
00:16:38,111 --> 00:16:41,716
It'll be safer to wait until your lunch digests before we do the procedure.

411
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:42,912
Perfect.

412
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:45,196
This is just perfect.

413
00:16:45,275 --> 00:16:46,658
I was hoping to be in Portland right now.

414
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:50,085
You're gonna be under conscious sedation, JP, which means you'll be awake but groggy.

415
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,230
Is this gonna hurt?

416
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,695
You'll have some discomfort, but we'll give you something for pain.

417
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:58,038
Do you know how stupid you make me look?

418
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,621
I thought you would think this is funny.

419
00:17:00,648 --> 00:17:02,090
Romantic.

420
00:17:02,591 --> 00:17:04,433
Like the therapist thing was funny and romantic?

421
00:17:04,453 --> 00:17:05,516
That was funny.

422
00:17:05,615 --> 00:17:06,758
No, that was sad.

423
00:17:06,998 --> 00:17:11,184
He called my therapist pretending to be his therapist to find out what I'd said about him.

424
00:17:11,345 --> 00:17:12,987
He's a little passive-aggressive, isn't he?

425
00:17:13,008 --> 00:17:13,428
A little.

426
00:17:13,448 --> 00:17:14,971
He is the king of passive-aggressive.

427
00:17:15,551 --> 00:17:16,834
And he's manipulative.

428
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:17,914
And needy.

429
00:17:19,217 --> 00:17:20,078
That's the trifecta.

430
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:21,221
What do I win?

431
00:17:25,186 --> 00:17:25,547
What?

432
00:17:27,911 --> 00:17:28,511
Duh.

433
00:17:30,971 --> 00:17:32,714
I prefer we stop meeting like this, Mr. Owens.

434
00:17:33,415 --> 00:17:33,896
Digby.

435
00:17:35,117 --> 00:17:36,721
So how's the trumpet playing?

436
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,503
Very safe compared to your hobby.

437
00:17:40,487 --> 00:17:42,209
Getting shot is a little more risky.

438
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:43,290
That's kind of the point.

439
00:17:44,292 --> 00:17:45,034
He's running a fever.

440
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:48,057
Due to the extra stress on his body from the gunshot.

441
00:17:48,078 --> 00:17:55,951
Digby, the impact of the bullet in your chest fractured a rib and caused a hemopneumothorax.

442
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:56,731
That sucks, I guess.

443
00:17:57,031 --> 00:17:58,734
Well, there's blood in your collapsed lung.

444
00:17:59,103 --> 00:18:01,226
The price of body art went up since your last gunshot.

445
00:18:01,826 --> 00:18:03,048
Eh, no pain, no gain, right?

446
00:18:03,489 --> 00:18:04,391
That's one way to look at it.

447
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:06,634
And we have that in common, you docs and me.

448
00:18:07,174 --> 00:18:07,474
Do it.

449
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:10,819
Yeah, the way you guys push and push and push.

450
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,126
When I was wrestling, if you wanted to pin me, you was gonna have to kill me.

451
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:16,888
Iowa style.

452
00:18:17,088 --> 00:18:18,171
Iowa State style.

453
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:20,534
Back home, we were sworn enemies.

454
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:23,659
But here in Seattle, man, we're brothers.

455
00:18:26,643 --> 00:18:30,548
Now, so what are we going to do about this, uh, hemo-numo-jurassic?

456
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:33,752
We're going to insert a chest tube to drain the blood and then reinflate your lung.

457
00:18:35,977 --> 00:18:36,396
Oh, please.

458
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:38,681
Tell me I get to watch.

459
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:47,393
Oh, man.

460
00:18:47,413 --> 00:18:50,278
I will stop.

461
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:52,140
Before you guys start, I know you're mad.

462
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,582
Disbelief, Claire.

463
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:53,982
Just...

464
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,131
Disbelief.

465
00:18:55,772 --> 00:18:56,914
I'm just concerned.

466
00:18:57,817 --> 00:18:59,480
Where did you get the idea to do this?

467
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,164
The internet.

468
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:04,670
But honey, there is a healthy way to lose weight.

469
00:19:06,614 --> 00:19:12,444
Yeah, I've tried that, but it doesn't work for me like it does for you.

470
00:19:13,301 --> 00:19:15,906
Hey, you don't need to lose weight.

471
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:17,148
What are you waiting?

472
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,472
And how much have you been working out?

473
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:23,820
I mean, you know, most of the time when people hit their target weight, they have to work to stay there.

474
00:19:24,442 --> 00:19:26,987
Everyone gains weight in college, Mom.

475
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,492
It's stressful.

476
00:19:31,335 --> 00:19:35,782
There's not enough time for exercise.

477
00:19:37,888 --> 00:19:44,459
I just thought if I wasn't worried about my diet, then I could focus more on my studies.

478
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:46,401
So you took yet another shortcut.

479
00:19:47,522 --> 00:19:48,964
Life doesn't work that way, Claire.

480
00:19:49,365 --> 00:19:49,726
Tina.

481
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:50,507
What?

482
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:51,628
You want to argue this?

483
00:19:53,872 --> 00:19:55,213
She has so much potential.

484
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,997
If she would just apply herself.

485
00:19:57,336 --> 00:19:57,657
OK.

486
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,804
I think we should focus on taking care of your daughter.

487
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:08,339
And Claire, your parents agree the best thing to do is to reverse the bypass.

488
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:08,820
No.

489
00:20:10,403 --> 00:20:11,546
No, it's my body.

490
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:15,472
I do not want surgery again, please.

491
00:20:15,492 --> 00:20:19,299
There are serious complications, and this is about your health.

492
00:20:20,102 --> 00:20:21,243
But I'd rather be thin.

493
00:20:21,984 --> 00:20:23,708
Well, I'm afraid the choice isn't up to you.

494
00:20:37,761 --> 00:20:39,483
It's called Rasmussen's encephalitis.

495
00:20:40,664 --> 00:20:44,169
What it amounts to is that this side of her brain, this part's all healthy.

496
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,411
It's working perfectly.

497
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:48,734
This black part of the brain, his, all of that is dead or dying.

498
00:20:49,635 --> 00:20:53,079
The condition has gotten radically worse since her CT scans three months ago.

499
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:56,123
Left untreated, the disease is going to kill her.

500
00:20:58,145 --> 00:20:58,645
How soon?

501
00:20:59,728 --> 00:21:00,107
Too soon.

502
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,432
So is there a cure?

503
00:21:04,136 --> 00:21:07,720
Yeah, the treatment requires the diseased portion of her brain be removed and sealed off.

504
00:21:08,721 --> 00:21:12,825
See, eventually, the spinal fluid will fill the cavity.

505
00:21:12,845 --> 00:21:13,884
Remove what?

506
00:21:13,904 --> 00:21:15,866
I mean, that's... Half her brain, yes.

507
00:21:24,894 --> 00:21:25,576
Half her brain?

508
00:21:25,655 --> 00:21:28,178
That seems impossible.

509
00:21:28,898 --> 00:21:29,979
Her age makes it possible.

510
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,042
Her brain's not fully developed, so the remaining neurons will...

511
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,307
Compensate for the loss.

512
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:38,090
But will she be normal?

513
00:21:38,111 --> 00:21:39,211
Is there a risk to any surgery?

514
00:21:39,413 --> 00:21:41,335
And this is, you know, a major one.

515
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:47,221
But if, you know, we're successful, Jamie could walk out of this hospital in a couple of weeks, go on to live a relatively normal life.

516
00:21:47,761 --> 00:21:51,286
Look, I know this is a lot to digest, but the important thing to remember is that we can save a life.

517
00:21:51,786 --> 00:21:52,186
Thank you.

518
00:21:52,247 --> 00:21:53,708
Dr. O'Malley.

519
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:54,788
Yes, what?

520
00:21:55,549 --> 00:22:00,756
I'm sorry to bother you, but if the parents consent, I thought you'd like to scrub in on a hemispherectomy.

521
00:22:00,776 --> 00:22:02,317
Are you in or not?

522
00:22:02,337 --> 00:22:02,577
Uh, in.

523
00:22:12,868 --> 00:22:16,978
Gang, I'm scrubbing in on a hemispherectomy with Shepard.

524
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:18,160
Get out.

525
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,122
I would kill for that.

526
00:22:19,162 --> 00:22:22,470
We're going to cut out half the girl's brain, and it's going to work.

527
00:22:23,391 --> 00:22:24,073
It's outrageous.

528
00:22:25,576 --> 00:22:27,661
Almost makes it hard to hate him.

529
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:28,362
Why do you hate him?

530
00:22:28,762 --> 00:22:30,425
Oh, no reason.

531
00:22:30,446 --> 00:22:31,528
You know about him and Merida?

532
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:33,492
You know?

533
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:36,240
I'm going to figure out that I know everything.

534
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:36,682
She knows.

535
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:38,486
All about Dr. Sest.

536
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:39,809
It's been going on for like ever.

537
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:40,731
What?

538
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:41,634
And you didn't tell us?

539
00:22:41,974 --> 00:22:43,258
Oh, you're a gossip, huh?

540
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:43,838
I am not.

541
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:45,001
I am.

542
00:22:45,488 --> 00:22:48,351
He's about to go into major brain surgery on no sleep.

543
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:49,652
Not very responsible.

544
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:50,553
Shall I smash?

545
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:52,414
Sex all night isn't about being responsible.

546
00:22:52,615 --> 00:22:53,935
No, it's about sex all night.

547
00:22:54,217 --> 00:22:56,618
I can't believe you're not more pissed off about this, you of all people.

548
00:22:56,878 --> 00:22:57,960
She works hard all day.

549
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,021
She's good at her job.

550
00:22:59,061 --> 00:23:00,542
Why should you care how she unwinds?

551
00:23:00,883 --> 00:23:02,204
I mean, you like to bake all night.

552
00:23:02,345 --> 00:23:03,346
Some people like to drink.

553
00:23:03,405 --> 00:23:05,167
Others like an occasional screaming orgasm.

554
00:23:05,347 --> 00:23:05,807
Yeah, we do.

555
00:23:08,431 --> 00:23:09,832
Forget I said that.

556
00:23:09,852 --> 00:23:10,532
Pretend like I'm not here.

557
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:15,478
You look like you need to be spoon fed.

558
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:17,527
You look like Alex.

559
00:23:18,368 --> 00:23:23,336
OK, about drinking, Dr. Taylor, the anesthesiologist, do you think he drinks?

560
00:23:24,077 --> 00:23:25,359
I said, whatever gets you through the day.

561
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,461
No, but I mean here at work.

562
00:23:26,821 --> 00:23:28,144
Earlier, I thought I smelled.

563
00:23:29,445 --> 00:23:30,067
You know, do you think?

564
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,530
I mean, his patients trust the.

565
00:23:34,594 --> 00:23:37,057
So I should say something, right?

566
00:23:37,077 --> 00:23:38,059
It's a can of worms, George.

567
00:23:39,741 --> 00:23:41,365
And why are we talking about sex, anyway?

568
00:23:47,992 --> 00:23:50,436
This is going to leave a pretty sexy scar, huh?

569
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:52,740
Don't get any more crazy ideas.

570
00:23:53,821 --> 00:23:55,324
You really think my ideas are crazy?

571
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,026
I'm leaning that way.

572
00:23:57,747 --> 00:23:59,068
We wrestle, he plays trumpet.

573
00:24:00,991 --> 00:24:02,013
I feel pretty dizzy.

574
00:24:02,994 --> 00:24:03,776
You've lost some blood.

575
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:07,020
This too shall pass.

576
00:24:08,542 --> 00:24:09,124
Hey.

577
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,818
How come I don't see you down at the mat and bell time?

578
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,361
Oh, man, no time.

579
00:24:14,882 --> 00:24:15,884
Bro, make time.

580
00:24:17,145 --> 00:24:18,207
I'll be expecting you.

581
00:24:19,528 --> 00:24:25,557
Oh, man.

582
00:24:25,577 --> 00:24:26,460
Handle with care.

583
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,843
This thing's full of gunk, I know.

584
00:24:29,463 --> 00:24:33,430
We need to free the bowel from the adhesions caused from the abscess.

585
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:35,192
This poor girl.

586
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:36,494
Cell phone.

587
00:24:36,829 --> 00:24:38,132
What was she thinking?

588
00:24:38,152 --> 00:24:39,433
She wants her mother's approval.

589
00:24:40,134 --> 00:24:41,116
She wanted to please her.

590
00:24:41,557 --> 00:24:42,878
And this damages the result?

591
00:24:42,979 --> 00:24:45,363
Here, resect that.

592
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,904
Needle tip bovie, please.

593
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:50,590
When you're done here, you have post-ops waiting.

594
00:24:51,451 --> 00:24:52,513
I know, Dr. Bailey.

595
00:24:52,794 --> 00:24:55,659
Christina's got the flu, so you need to pick up the slack in the clinic.

596
00:24:55,878 --> 00:24:57,741
Look, I'm off the floors, OK?

597
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:01,227
Sorry, that was inappropriate.

598
00:25:01,247 --> 00:25:03,089
It's not the only thing that's inappropriate.

599
00:25:06,242 --> 00:25:07,484
Are we on the subject?

600
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:09,067
You care to tell me what you think you're doing?

601
00:25:09,086 --> 00:25:11,150
Look, I'll jump through hoops if you want me to.

602
00:25:11,589 --> 00:25:14,134
But what I do when I leave this hospital is my business.

603
00:25:14,494 --> 00:25:16,477
Half this hospital knows your business.

604
00:25:16,497 --> 00:25:18,640
Flu isn't the only virus spreading around here.

605
00:25:19,421 --> 00:25:20,162
I made a choice.

606
00:25:20,502 --> 00:25:22,645
And I know you don't respect me for that choice.

607
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:25,048
But I'll live with the consequences.

608
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,792
Then I'll have lots of hoops for you to jump through.

609
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:29,474
I've done everything you've asked me to do.

610
00:25:29,935 --> 00:25:32,038
I may not do it your way, but it gets done.

611
00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:34,883
So whatever else you got, bring it on.

612
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:46,001
Okay, Dr. Gray, now that you've drained the organ, we can attempt to repair it.

613
00:25:46,923 --> 00:25:48,704
Now my day is perfect.

614
00:25:51,628 --> 00:25:51,949
Okay, bye.

615
00:25:55,673 --> 00:25:56,413
I appreciate this.

616
00:25:56,454 --> 00:26:02,642
The chance to scrub in on this kind of procedure is, well, yeah, I appreciate it.

617
00:26:04,006 --> 00:26:04,906
Here you go.

618
00:26:04,926 --> 00:26:06,429
Triple espresso, not too hot.

619
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:08,351
Oh, I love you.

620
00:26:08,371 --> 00:26:08,671
Seriously.

621
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,471
Ah, coffee.

622
00:26:09,592 --> 00:26:11,874
Where would medicine be without it, huh?

623
00:26:11,894 --> 00:26:11,994
Yeah.

624
00:26:12,015 --> 00:26:13,336
Oh, I hope you have a new crossword, too.

625
00:26:13,355 --> 00:26:14,857
I'm going to be here a while.

626
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:15,979
Never go without.

627
00:26:16,819 --> 00:26:17,840
Big day for you, kid.

628
00:26:17,881 --> 00:26:18,381
Congrats.

629
00:26:18,781 --> 00:26:19,122
Thanks.

630
00:26:20,042 --> 00:26:20,624
Hey, princess.

631
00:26:21,525 --> 00:26:22,526
You ready to take a nap?

632
00:26:23,626 --> 00:26:24,567
Hey, look what I can blow bubbles.

633
00:26:24,587 --> 00:26:24,988
That's it.

634
00:26:25,008 --> 00:26:25,608
You just breathe in.

635
00:26:25,628 --> 00:26:27,530
Oh, that's it.

636
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:28,571
What?

637
00:26:28,592 --> 00:26:29,232
Do you smell?

638
00:26:29,973 --> 00:26:30,233
Smell what?

639
00:26:30,253 --> 00:26:31,194
You can't have a mask.

640
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:43,642
I'm sorry, Dr. Taylor, but did you just... Have you been drinking?

641
00:26:45,724 --> 00:26:46,405
I beg your pardon?

642
00:26:47,326 --> 00:26:47,527
What?

643
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:51,132
Do you smell... I smell alcohol.

644
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:53,654
Where the hell do you get off accusing me of something like that?

645
00:26:56,178 --> 00:26:57,259
George, you're out of wine.

646
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,701
There are rules.

647
00:26:58,741 --> 00:27:00,884
You know, there are rules for a reason.

648
00:27:00,944 --> 00:27:01,164
You just...

649
00:27:05,109 --> 00:27:06,813
There is a two-year-old girl on this table.

650
00:27:09,176 --> 00:27:11,622
You shouldn't take advantage of someone else's vulnerability.

651
00:27:11,662 --> 00:27:14,307
Look, I don't need some punk intern telling me what's at stake here.

652
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:16,329
Get him out of here, Shep.

653
00:27:19,896 --> 00:27:20,136
Shep.

654
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,423
You're out, George.

655
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:34,388
You damn well better be ready, Taylor.

656
00:27:34,813 --> 00:27:36,365
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

657
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,810
Do you really seriously want to know why I'm leaving?

658
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:43,893
Seriously?

659
00:27:44,313 --> 00:27:48,838
How about when you started insisting that I quit my job right when I started to make more money than you?

660
00:27:49,058 --> 00:27:50,942
That should have been the last straw.

661
00:27:51,281 --> 00:27:51,521
No, no.

662
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:59,413
No, the last straw should have been when I found out that those mysterious phone calls that you'd been getting that you kept denying were from other women were really coming from your mother.

663
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:01,234
This isn't healthy.

664
00:28:01,295 --> 00:28:02,537
Just hold still, please.

665
00:28:02,557 --> 00:28:03,657
Don't you dare try to catch this.

666
00:28:03,938 --> 00:28:05,681
Okay, could the both of you just please stop?

667
00:28:05,921 --> 00:28:07,843
You don't love me, JP.

668
00:28:07,863 --> 00:28:08,344
You love to smother me.

669
00:28:08,324 --> 00:28:13,309
And if I could just get you to admit that, then I could leave you with an ounce of respect.

670
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:17,816
Hey, Athena, I let you stay in here to keep him calm, so if you're just gonna keep on... Check that.

671
00:28:17,836 --> 00:28:21,880
I can't respect a man desperate enough to swallow my exit strategy.

672
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:23,762
That is the last straw.

673
00:28:23,843 --> 00:28:25,285
Michelle, can you get her out of here?

674
00:28:25,345 --> 00:28:26,946
Ma'am?

675
00:28:28,008 --> 00:28:28,788
Fine.

676
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:31,152
Come on.

677
00:28:31,172 --> 00:28:31,372
What?

678
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:34,976
What's happening?

679
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:36,357
The keys move farther down.

680
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:37,960
Oh, my God, what does that mean?

681
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:39,701
What did you do?

682
00:28:40,061 --> 00:28:41,724
Don't you dare die, JP.

683
00:28:41,785 --> 00:28:42,306
Oh, please.

684
00:28:42,546 --> 00:28:43,587
Please, just shut up.

685
00:28:43,748 --> 00:28:44,650
Just breathe, JP.

686
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:45,852
Just breathe.

687
00:28:49,198 --> 00:28:49,538
Got it.

688
00:28:57,791 --> 00:29:01,198
Very impressive, JP.

689
00:29:01,939 --> 00:29:02,200
You OK?

690
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:02,619
Are you OK?

691
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:02,840
Yeah.

692
00:29:03,221 --> 00:29:04,182
You'll be fine.

693
00:29:10,795 --> 00:29:14,063
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

694
00:29:15,226 --> 00:29:16,387
Can I offer you some advice?

695
00:29:17,852 --> 00:29:21,200
Get in your car and go, for all of our sakes.

696
00:29:23,865 --> 00:29:25,851
You're never gonna find where I parked it.

697
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:32,397
I need a shower.

698
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:33,699
I need a shower.

699
00:29:33,858 --> 00:29:37,343
You need to go tell that girl's parents what kind of kid they're getting back.

700
00:29:37,363 --> 00:29:38,824
You're not going to let me shower first?

701
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,126
That would be a hoop, would it not?

702
00:29:41,886 --> 00:29:42,887
It would qualify.

703
00:29:42,928 --> 00:29:45,290
Shower first, then.

704
00:29:47,053 --> 00:29:50,435
Ew, it smells.

705
00:29:50,935 --> 00:29:54,839
That would be me, or more specifically, my patient's insides all over me.

706
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,643
That makes me strangely happy.

707
00:30:01,015 --> 00:30:02,656
I smell like karma.

708
00:30:03,297 --> 00:30:03,557
What?

709
00:30:04,298 --> 00:30:04,638
Nothing.

710
00:30:04,659 --> 00:30:06,621
Oh, there's something vile stuck in your hair.

711
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:08,363
You know, just go stand over there, please.

712
00:30:13,307 --> 00:30:13,407
Ugh.

713
00:30:13,868 --> 00:30:16,070
How much do I love being a surgeon right now?

714
00:30:17,231 --> 00:30:18,394
Karma?

715
00:30:18,413 --> 00:30:20,316
What does karma have to do with anything?

716
00:30:20,816 --> 00:30:26,001
I'm just saying, you've been given all the best surgeries, and now you smell like putrid goo.

717
00:30:26,843 --> 00:30:27,923
And you're giving off a stench.

718
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,065
Karma's a bitch.

719
00:30:30,951 --> 00:30:32,954
Dr. Shepherd needs an intern in surgery.

720
00:30:32,974 --> 00:30:33,977
Which one of you is clear to go?

721
00:30:33,997 --> 00:30:34,577
I'm good, Dr. Bailey.

722
00:30:34,597 --> 00:30:35,419
Where do you want me?

723
00:30:35,439 --> 00:30:36,681
You need to lie down somewhere.

724
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,061
I'm fine.

725
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:38,984
I'm completely healthy.

726
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:39,345
Gray.

727
00:30:40,386 --> 00:30:40,807
Of course.

728
00:30:41,729 --> 00:30:42,830
What is your problem?

729
00:30:43,192 --> 00:30:44,053
Um, you.

730
00:30:44,614 --> 00:30:48,760
Because apparently you can help Dr. McDreamy in ways the rest of us can't.

731
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:53,327
You did not just say... Yes, I did.

732
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:54,849
Hey!

733
00:30:54,869 --> 00:30:57,253
Hemispherectomy and OR1 with Dr. Shepherd.

734
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:57,734
Go.

735
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:14,798
Apparently, I'm not the only one with hoops.

736
00:31:14,818 --> 00:31:18,103
If you're gonna get up, you might as well get up.

737
00:31:18,123 --> 00:31:18,523
Doctor.

738
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:24,471
Digby's post-op CBC shows a severe spike in the white blood cell count.

739
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:24,852
What is it?

740
00:31:25,432 --> 00:31:27,054
It's 27 with 16% bands.

741
00:31:27,855 --> 00:31:28,635
Something else is wrong.

742
00:31:29,176 --> 00:31:30,558
That's a little high for simple stress.

743
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:35,805
Check for any other possible sources of infection or recent illness.

744
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:40,955
All right, we're going to start the procedure with the left temporal rectum.

745
00:31:40,976 --> 00:31:43,240
Thanks for joining us, Dr. Yang.

746
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:57,085
After the temporal, we'll do the frontal and then the occipital rectum.

747
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:05,121
We were able to reverse the gastric bypass, but we did lose a significant portion of her bowel.

748
00:32:05,442 --> 00:32:08,968
And because of the short gut syndrome, Claire will never eat normally again.

749
00:32:08,988 --> 00:32:09,048
OK.

750
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:11,271
What?

751
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:11,752
Can we?

752
00:32:12,374 --> 00:32:13,375
How do we help her here?

753
00:32:14,156 --> 00:32:17,182
Well, getting proper nutrition will be a lifelong problem for Claire.

754
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:17,843
Great.

755
00:32:17,863 --> 00:32:19,865
As if we already don't have our hands full with her.

756
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,291
She gets good grades.

757
00:32:23,845 --> 00:32:24,986
She stays out of trouble.

758
00:32:25,006 --> 00:32:26,327
She's smart.

759
00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:30,353
I just think she feels like nothing she does is good enough for you.

760
00:32:30,373 --> 00:32:33,076
If you somehow think that I'm responsible for this.

761
00:32:33,096 --> 00:32:36,660
I think Claire is killing herself to please you.

762
00:32:37,741 --> 00:32:38,182
Please.

763
00:32:41,405 --> 00:32:43,769
You have no idea what's going on in that girl's mind.

764
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:44,930
You're her mother.

765
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,792
She worships the ground you walk on.

766
00:32:50,096 --> 00:32:51,657
She didn't do this for herself.

767
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:59,153
I think that this situation is completely ridiculous.

768
00:32:59,212 --> 00:33:00,413
Shut up.

769
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:09,846
What is it?

770
00:33:10,567 --> 00:33:12,067
I'm freezing, doc.

771
00:33:12,087 --> 00:33:13,049
I can't stop shaking.

772
00:33:13,349 --> 00:33:15,451
His temp's way up and BP's dropping, doctor.

773
00:33:16,012 --> 00:33:20,117
All right, Dick B. Have you had any recent illnesses, new piercings, tattoos, wounds?

774
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:21,779
New tat on my calf.

775
00:33:30,484 --> 00:33:32,249
Oh, my God.

776
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:33,992
It was nowhere near that nasty this morning.

777
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:34,773
But it was infected.

778
00:33:35,415 --> 00:33:36,417
Why didn't you say anything?

779
00:33:36,438 --> 00:33:37,118
Ah, it was nothing.

780
00:33:38,742 --> 00:33:40,527
I'm not here to complain about a little pain.

781
00:33:41,348 --> 00:33:44,295
Well, the infection's been exacerbated by the stress in your body from the gunshot.

782
00:33:44,915 --> 00:33:45,778
Get him to ICU.

783
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,865
We'll get you started on some antibiotics.

784
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:01,348
We'll encounter the anterior cerebral artery.

785
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:08,840
Yes, and we're going to need to... The branches of the artery need to be coagulated and divided.

786
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,403
You know, Taylor, her anesthesia is awful light.

787
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:15,269
Come on, Taylor.

788
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:16,411
She's waking up.

789
00:34:20,498 --> 00:34:21,059
Dr. Taylor.

790
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:23,282
He's asleep.

791
00:34:24,864 --> 00:34:25,364
Taylor!

792
00:34:34,862 --> 00:34:35,884
Dr. Taylor!

793
00:34:37,364 --> 00:34:38,045
Oh, god.

794
00:34:38,065 --> 00:34:38,346
Sorry.

795
00:34:38,425 --> 00:34:38,726
Sorry.

796
00:34:38,907 --> 00:34:39,246
I'm on it.

797
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:44,152
My bad, Chuck.

798
00:34:44,172 --> 00:34:44,811
He was right, wasn't he?

799
00:34:46,514 --> 00:34:47,275
I nodded off.

800
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:47,695
Come on.

801
00:34:47,715 --> 00:34:49,277
Yeah, whatever you got to do to get through the day, all right?

802
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:50,538
Steph, get me some coffee.

803
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:51,318
Yes, doctor.

804
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:52,920
I'll be fine.

805
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,701
It won't happen again.

806
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,782
Yeah, not in here it won't.

807
00:34:55,902 --> 00:34:57,244
Steph, call Dr. Pennington.

808
00:34:57,844 --> 00:34:59,405
Hopkins, take over until she gets here.

809
00:35:00,007 --> 00:35:01,208
Get out of here and get it together.

810
00:35:09,034 --> 00:35:09,755
What happened?

811
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:12,900
He went into multisystem organ failure, secondary to overwhelming sepsis.

812
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,043
Now he's all.

813
00:35:14,483 --> 00:35:16,688
If it fixes his BP, that should help his mental status.

814
00:35:17,228 --> 00:35:19,331
He's maxed out on presto.

815
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:20,052
We got V-tach.

816
00:35:21,114 --> 00:35:21,815
He's looking bad.

817
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:25,282
Put the D-fib pads on him and give him 150 on amiodarone.

818
00:35:27,905 --> 00:35:28,007
Yeah.

819
00:35:28,027 --> 00:35:29,088
I lost his pulse.

820
00:35:29,108 --> 00:35:29,909
D-fib, get the pads.

821
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:32,994
Get the paddles in charge of 200.

822
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:33,135
Clear.

823
00:35:40,625 --> 00:36:03,239
This packing we hope will, uh...

824
00:36:03,894 --> 00:36:04,856
prevent hemorrhaging.

825
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:06,697
Dr. Yang, do you want to add something to that?

826
00:36:06,717 --> 00:36:09,641
We'll allow the cerebral spinal fluid to eventually fill the cavity.

827
00:36:10,442 --> 00:36:11,202
Very nice.

828
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:12,364
You two, you want to close up?

829
00:36:12,744 --> 00:36:13,987
Yes, Doc.

830
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:14,567
I'm going to go to bed.

831
00:36:16,168 --> 00:36:17,791
That was unreal.

832
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:20,313
I mean, that's all there is.

833
00:36:20,454 --> 00:36:23,416
I was feeling sick until I came here.

834
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:24,398
I was tired.

835
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,221
Now I'm tired again.

836
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,003
It's back to reality.

837
00:36:29,324 --> 00:36:32,788
So forget about your troubles

838
00:36:36,025 --> 00:36:36,726
Let me explain.

839
00:36:36,746 --> 00:36:37,146
It's fine.

840
00:36:37,266 --> 00:36:38,550
No, there is a code among doctors.

841
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,572
We're not supposed to ask each other questions.

842
00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:42,657
Not within the walls of this hospital.

843
00:36:42,898 --> 00:36:43,960
Okay, I was out of line.

844
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:44,721
No, you weren't.

845
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:45,242
I was.

846
00:36:46,925 --> 00:36:47,646
I was out of line.

847
00:36:48,869 --> 00:36:52,456
Somebody should have taken responsibility, and it should have been the guy doing the cutting.

848
00:36:52,576 --> 00:36:53,277
It should have been me.

849
00:36:54,518 --> 00:36:55,942
You didn't deserve what happened to you today.

850
00:36:56,523 --> 00:36:57,344
You did the right thing.

851
00:36:57,744 --> 00:36:58,606
Code or no code.

852
00:37:08,695 --> 00:37:10,697
You saw me leave the house this morning, didn't you?

853
00:37:11,739 --> 00:37:12,378
Oh, is that you?

854
00:37:12,418 --> 00:37:17,304
I'm not using her.

855
00:37:18,827 --> 00:37:19,967
And I don't favor her.

856
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,632
She's pretty great, you know.

857
00:37:26,576 --> 00:37:26,815
Mm-hmm.

858
00:37:26,835 --> 00:37:26,936
Yeah.

859
00:37:26,956 --> 00:37:30,400
So come on, let's go tell Jamie's parents she's going to be fine, barring any complications.

860
00:37:34,396 --> 00:37:35,416
Did you fix me?

861
00:37:36,157 --> 00:37:38,141
No, not completely.

862
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:41,907
So I won't get fat?

863
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:42,166
No.

864
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:47,014
Oh, that's awesome.

865
00:37:47,034 --> 00:37:50,378
Claire, I've asked social services to contact your parents.

866
00:37:51,981 --> 00:37:52,481
Why?

867
00:37:53,103 --> 00:37:55,105
They can help you.

868
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:58,831
With what?

869
00:37:58,851 --> 00:38:03,356
You don't know this yet, but life isn't supposed to be like this.

870
00:38:04,972 --> 00:38:06,514
It's not supposed to be this hard.

871
00:38:06,936 --> 00:38:13,905
Well, don't worry with your suitcase, dear.

872
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:15,005
Time of death, 2049.

873
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:19,210
Don't worry with your suitcase, dear.

874
00:38:19,231 --> 00:38:22,255
First guy I ever met out here from back home.

875
00:38:22,275 --> 00:38:29,405
Because the people out to get you don't know that you're here.

876
00:38:29,425 --> 00:38:31,166
So don't worry with your suitcase, dear.

877
00:38:35,516 --> 00:38:36,898
I thought you'd be asleep by now.

878
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:41,824
Yeah, well, I'm not.

879
00:38:41,844 --> 00:38:44,726
You wait a few minutes, you can have a piece of cake baked a chock full of love.

880
00:38:46,009 --> 00:38:50,994
Actually, chock full of unrelenting, all-consuming rage and hostility, but still tasty.

881
00:38:51,074 --> 00:38:52,496
So you know.

882
00:38:52,675 --> 00:38:52,936
I know.

883
00:38:54,978 --> 00:39:01,405
Well, do you want the long-sworded version, or do you want the short version where I started sleeping with a guy who turned out to be my boss?

884
00:39:01,686 --> 00:39:02,907
Neither.

885
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:04,893
Izzy, cut me some slack here.

886
00:39:05,514 --> 00:39:05,733
No.

887
00:39:06,335 --> 00:39:07,297
You went to Dartmouth.

888
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:09,019
Your mother is Ellis Gray.

889
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:11,063
You grew up... Look at this house.

890
00:39:11,804 --> 00:39:15,570
You know, you walk into the O.R., and there isn't anyone who doubts that you should be there.

891
00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:17,793
I grew up in a trailer park.

892
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,456
I went to state school.

893
00:39:19,496 --> 00:39:22,041
I put myself through med school by posing in my underwear.

894
00:39:22,601 --> 00:39:25,487
You know, I walk into the O.R., and everyone hopes I'm the nurse.

895
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:30,735
You have their respect without even trying, and you're throwing it away for what?

896
00:39:31,016 --> 00:39:32,117
A few good surgeries?

897
00:39:32,396 --> 00:39:32,657
No.

898
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:34,721
It's not about the surgeries.

899
00:39:35,422 --> 00:39:36,503
It's not about getting ahead.

900
00:39:36,963 --> 00:39:37,545
Then what?

901
00:39:38,766 --> 00:39:39,748
A little hot sex?

902
00:39:40,728 --> 00:39:42,911
You're willing to ruin your credibility over that?

903
00:39:42,931 --> 00:39:46,617
I mean, Meredith, what the hell are you doing?

904
00:39:46,657 --> 00:39:51,744
Oh, my god.

905
00:39:53,193 --> 00:39:54,253
You're falling for him.

906
00:39:54,273 --> 00:39:55,315
I am not.

907
00:39:55,956 --> 00:39:57,318
Oh, you so are.

908
00:39:57,338 --> 00:39:58,980
No, I'm not.

909
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:01,023
You so are.

910
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:03,585
Damn it.

911
00:40:03,606 --> 00:40:04,688
You poor girl.

912
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:12,016
You know, it's just that he's just so, and I'm just, I'm having a hard time.

913
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:20,027
You're all mushy and warm and full of secret feelings.

914
00:40:24,934 --> 00:40:25,615
I hate you.

915
00:40:27,277 --> 00:40:27,918
And your cake.

916
00:40:28,398 --> 00:40:31,561
My cake is good.

917
00:40:31,581 --> 00:40:33,824
So, um, how hot is this sex?

918
00:40:36,327 --> 00:40:36,907
Izzy.

919
00:40:36,927 --> 00:40:37,248
What?

920
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:38,949
Come on, I'm not getting any.

921
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:48,280
Help a girl out with a few details.

922
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,043
Maybe we like the pain.

923
00:40:56,356 --> 00:40:58,559
How's she doing?

924
00:40:58,719 --> 00:40:58,900
Good.

925
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,862
Good.

926
00:40:59,882 --> 00:41:01,384
Maybe we're wired that way.

927
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:10,239
Christina?

928
00:41:13,643 --> 00:41:15,927
Because without it, I don't know.

929
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:22,818
Maybe we just wouldn't feel real.

930
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:35,057
You know, we could just... Sleep?

931
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,204
We could, yeah, if you want to.

932
00:41:39,824 --> 00:41:43,849
Yeah?

933
00:41:45,112 --> 00:41:45,932
What's that saying?

934
00:41:46,934 --> 00:41:49,056
Why do I keep hitting myself with a hammer?

935
00:41:49,998 --> 00:41:51,219
Oh, thank God.

936
00:41:53,173 --> 00:42:00,264
because it feels so good when I stop.
