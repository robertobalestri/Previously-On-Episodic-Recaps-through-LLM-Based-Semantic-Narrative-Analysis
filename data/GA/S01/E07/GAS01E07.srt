1
00:00:00,889 --> 00:00:02,718
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,764 --> 00:00:05,145
I've had this thing for my roommate since day one,

3
00:00:05,207 --> 00:00:07,520
and I can't tell her.

4
00:00:08,514 --> 00:00:10,163
Wouldn't it be easier to just ask her out?

5
00:00:10,547 --> 00:00:13,076
Are really as shallow and callous as you seem?

6
00:00:13,521 --> 00:00:16,265
Oh, you want to go out for a drink later and

7
00:00:16,421 --> 00:00:17,802
hear about my secret pain?

8
00:00:17,874 --> 00:00:19,385
I can't. I'm seeing someone.

9
00:00:19,466 --> 00:00:20,920
Save yourself the misery, man.

10
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:22,128
She's off the market.

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,120
What? But she's not. I mean, if she was...

12
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,990
I live with her - I would know it.

13
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,500
And the longer this little fling goes on,

14
00:00:28,564 --> 00:00:31,452
the more favors you get over the others -

15
00:00:31,503 --> 00:00:34,114
who are fighting tooth and nail just
to make it through this program -

16
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:37,268
when those people start finding
out what's going on...

17
00:00:37,494 --> 00:00:39,674
What is this that we're doing here?

18
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:41,477
You need a definition?

19
00:00:41,544 --> 00:00:44,539
The next time I see you favoring
Meredith Grey in any way,

20
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:47,708
I'll make sure she doesn't see the
inside of an O.R. for a month.

21
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:55,618
Okay, anyone who says you can sleep when you die,

22
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:59,178
tell them to come talk to me
after a few months as an intern.

23
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,394
Of course, it's not just the job
that keeps us up all night.

24
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:06,482
You have to get up now.

25
00:01:08,552 --> 00:01:09,228
What?

26
00:01:09,678 --> 00:01:11,040
Oh, my god, what time is it?

27
00:01:12,556 --> 00:01:14,060
It's 5:20,

28
00:01:14,737 --> 00:01:16,371
and I have prerounds.

29
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:19,719
And you have to leave before they see you.

30
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:20,989
Oh, come on, now.

31
00:01:22,073 --> 00:01:23,391
Why don't you just let them see?

32
00:01:23,468 --> 00:01:24,160
No!

33
00:01:24,238 --> 00:01:25,586
- Please!
- No. No.

34
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:28,284
You get any sleep?

35
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,880
Oh, she could oil the bedsprings as a
courtesy or at least buy a padded headboard.

36
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:37,228
So, who's the guy?

37
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:39,604
You think it was just one guy doing all that work?

38
00:01:39,673 --> 00:01:41,330
Do you mind if I don't think about that?

39
00:01:41,648 --> 00:01:43,056
Oh, jealous?

40
00:01:43,327 --> 00:01:44,325
I'm not jealous.

41
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:45,273
I am.

42
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,145
But at least I know she'll be
having a long day at work.

43
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,935
Well, at least we know brain
surgery isn't his only skill.

44
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:06,786
They can't be - he's her boss.

45
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,955
We're late.

46
00:02:08,297 --> 00:02:09,665
He's all of our boss.

47
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,961
She has been scrubbing in a
lot lately on his surgeries.

48
00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:16,361
No, Meredith wouldn't sleep with him just to - no.

49
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:18,764
If she's not ashamed of it, why
is she keeping it a secret?

50
00:02:18,947 --> 00:02:19,992
Maybe she didn't.

51
00:02:20,718 --> 00:02:21,931
Maybe it just happened -

52
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:25,342
you know, spontaneously, last night.

53
00:02:26,653 --> 00:02:28,292
- Hi. Good morning.
- Morning.

54
00:02:30,038 --> 00:02:33,801
It sounded like you were having pretty
radical sex last night, all night long.

55
00:02:34,258 --> 00:02:35,162
Who was the guy?

56
00:02:35,557 --> 00:02:36,463
No one you know.

57
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,431
We're late. Let's go.

58
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:41,906
I mean, if life's so hard already,

59
00:02:41,972 --> 00:02:44,508
why do we bring more trouble down on ourselves?

60
00:02:44,584 --> 00:02:47,322
What's up with the need to hit
the self-destruct button?

61
00:02:47,385 --> 00:02:50,087
Yikes, wouldn't want to meet you in a dark alley.

62
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,051
Right back at you.

63
00:02:51,155 --> 00:02:52,653
A run? You run?

64
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,589
Every day, babe, every day.

65
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,159
Not suffering enough?

66
00:02:56,445 --> 00:02:58,663
What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.

67
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:00,384
Don't go acting all indefatigable.

68
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:02,186
You're dragging like the rest of us.

69
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:05,295
Oh, what is that - professional
weakness, Dr. Yang?

70
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,917
- It's called the flu.
- Yeah.

71
00:03:07,881 --> 00:03:10,435
I need a major rush to make it through this day.

72
00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:12,856
I need a kick-ass surgery.

73
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:14,669
Ooh, you a bad boy last night, George?

74
00:03:15,053 --> 00:03:16,015
That would be Meredith.

75
00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:18,125
You a bad boy, Meredith?

76
00:03:19,497 --> 00:03:20,352
Do tell.

77
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:21,801
Nothing to tell.

78
00:03:21,898 --> 00:03:23,092
That says it all, huh?

79
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:26,537
Sorry, I have a sex life.

80
00:03:26,655 --> 00:03:27,720
Don't apologize.

81
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:28,810
Embrace it.

82
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:29,798
Share it.

83
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,268
Count me in.

84
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:36,742
Yeah. Next time, just let me know if I need
to go to a hotel so I can get some sleep.

85
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,119
- Am I missing something?
- You were just a little loud.

86
00:03:44,654 --> 00:03:47,314
Do they know it's Mcdreamy
keeping them up all night?

87
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:49,562
I hope not.

88
00:03:49,685 --> 00:03:51,160
I already have Bailey riding me.

89
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,195
I don't need my roommates thinking
I'm getting special treatment.

90
00:03:57,335 --> 00:04:00,407
O’Malley, Yang, Karev - go on to clinic.

91
00:04:02,223 --> 00:04:04,189
O’Malley, patients are waiting.

92
00:04:05,148 --> 00:04:06,488
You two come with me.

93
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:08,352
Izzie, you're hanging with me today.

94
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:10,314
Good morning, Dr. Shepherd.

95
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,072
Dr. Bailey.

96
00:04:15,275 --> 00:04:16,728
Late night, Grey?

97
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:19,929
No, caffeine just hasn't kicked in yet.

98
00:04:19,954 --> 00:04:23,171
If you were at all religious, you would
want to start praying it kicks in soon.

99
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:24,772
There's a consult in the pit.

100
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:26,697
Girl with a fever and abdominal pain.

101
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:29,778
After that, Nicholas in 3311 needs his meds.

102
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:32,764
Mr. Moeller's I.V. fell
out, and he's a hard stick.

103
00:04:32,847 --> 00:04:37,547
Post-ops in 1337, 3342, 3363, and 2381.

104
00:04:37,707 --> 00:04:39,145
...381.

105
00:04:39,955 --> 00:04:43,751
3342, 3363,

106
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:46,676
and 23...

107
00:04:47,198 --> 00:04:49,056
Why are you still standing in front of me?

108
00:04:51,444 --> 00:04:53,952
You look more like me than you right now.
What's the matter?

109
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:54,751
Nothing.

110
00:04:54,863 --> 00:04:56,795
Help! I need immediate help.

111
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:57,628
What's the problem?

112
00:04:57,776 --> 00:05:00,081
My damn boyfriend swallowed my keys.

113
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,415
I didn't want her to leave.

114
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,861
Locate the lady's keys.

115
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:09,998
I think she got some bug on her
trip to Mexico with her friends.

116
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:13,885
I told her not to go to a third world
country, but does she ever listen?

117
00:05:14,124 --> 00:05:16,577
She's been weak ever since, and she's lost weight.

118
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:17,903
Apparently.

119
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:20,187
And this morning, she passed out in the shower.

120
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:22,768
When was the trip?

121
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:25,200
A couple weeks ago.

122
00:05:25,343 --> 00:05:27,427
I'm really fine. I just have a fever.

123
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:31,293
Okay, well, will you lie back for an exam for me?

124
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:34,594
No, please, I don't need an exam.

125
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,902
Just give me some antibiotics, send me home.

126
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,535
Well, maybe it is just a fever,

127
00:05:39,763 --> 00:05:43,472
but they called down for a surgeon, so
I have to give the okay to let you go.

128
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,780
So just let me do the exam.

129
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:50,565
Do the exam.

130
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:51,773
No.

131
00:05:53,784 --> 00:05:55,792
This is crazy. I'm fine.

132
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,262
For god's sake, Claire, I don't
want to spend my entire day here.

133
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:06,129
You know, actually, Mrs. Rice, this
might be easier if we had some privacy,

134
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:08,909
so would you two mind leaving the room?

135
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,158
That's fine.

136
00:06:14,782 --> 00:06:17,095
Digby - Digby Owens. I have an appointment.

137
00:06:20,127 --> 00:06:21,996
Excuse me, sir - uh, you're bleeding.

138
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:22,856
You mind if I -

139
00:06:22,984 --> 00:06:24,833
Sure, sure. Have a look.

140
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,792
- That's a gunshot.
- Yeah.

141
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:30,091
We got a gunshot wound. We got
to get him down to the pit.

142
00:06:31,305 --> 00:06:32,707
Sit. Mr., Uh -

143
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:37,090
Digby. All right, but it isn't an emergency.
I scheduled it.

144
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,440
- What, the gunshot?
- Yeah. My buddy shot me.

145
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,310
- Buddy?
- Yeah, just as a favor.

146
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,630
- On purpose?
- Hell, yeah.

147
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,802
He wasn't trying to hurt me
or nothing, but you know...

148
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,681
But why?

149
00:06:45,977 --> 00:06:47,330
I like the scars.

150
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:21,262
Look, everyone in town has tats,
but my art is about commitment.

151
00:07:21,536 --> 00:07:23,364
So, this your art, huh?

152
00:07:23,472 --> 00:07:24,526
Damn straight.

153
00:07:24,776 --> 00:07:27,536
Damn stupid. The bullet went all the way through.

154
00:07:27,634 --> 00:07:29,238
Bounced off my ribs.

155
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:31,493
I have another one still in my shoulder.

156
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:33,144
Nice, huh?

157
00:07:34,398 --> 00:07:35,918
You could hang it in the Louvre.

158
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:37,684
I have an ethos.

159
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:42,046
Why do anything unless you're willing to
go one step further than anybody else?

160
00:07:42,134 --> 00:07:43,936
What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.

161
00:07:44,002 --> 00:07:45,037
Exactly.

162
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,834
And pain is the great divide.

163
00:07:46,998 --> 00:07:50,112
My coach used to say, it's all
about how we process pain.

164
00:07:50,254 --> 00:07:51,012
Football?

165
00:07:51,216 --> 00:07:52,619
Wrestling, Iowa state.

166
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:54,514
Iowa? 141.

167
00:07:54,611 --> 00:07:56,045
157.

168
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:57,667
You got to be more than 180 now.

169
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,207
I'd like to see you get back under 145.

170
00:08:00,311 --> 00:08:03,965
Excuse me, but thinking of you men
in tights makes me want to...

171
00:08:04,702 --> 00:08:05,496
puke.

172
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,128
There's a flu going around the hospital.

173
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:09,695
Somewhat ironic.

174
00:08:12,722 --> 00:08:13,438
Ow.

175
00:08:15,348 --> 00:08:16,762
Don't push so hard.

176
00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:22,368
Can you lift your shirt so I
can examine your stomach?

177
00:08:44,348 --> 00:08:45,731
Where did you get these?

178
00:08:50,816 --> 00:08:54,265
Claire... you've had surgery recently.

179
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:56,273
These scars are still pink.

180
00:08:57,056 --> 00:08:58,494
Don't tell my parents.

181
00:08:59,753 --> 00:09:02,279
You did this in Mexico so
your parents wouldn't know?

182
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:06,160
What did you have done?

183
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:15,851
And you noticed her foot twitching?

184
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:16,671
Come on, Jamie.

185
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,883
- My foot.
- Oh, yeah.

186
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:20,152
About three months ago?

187
00:09:20,234 --> 00:09:21,135
Just a little.

188
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:23,505
We took her to county hospital,
and she got the C.T.

189
00:09:23,518 --> 00:09:25,648
scan, which showed her -

190
00:09:25,712 --> 00:09:28,069
Brain abnormality. Here, you can put it.

191
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:29,901
And the twitching has gotten worse?

192
00:09:29,984 --> 00:09:34,012
A lot worse. They don't have the proper
equipment back home to figure out what's wrong.

193
00:09:34,468 --> 00:09:37,370
You did a - you did a good thing.

194
00:09:37,551 --> 00:09:39,807
- Yes, your mommy.
- Show mommy and daddy.

195
00:09:39,885 --> 00:09:44,109
Okay. You did a good thing by coming
all this way, Mr. and Mrs. Hayes.

196
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:45,850
You sit tight, Jamie, okay?

197
00:09:46,096 --> 00:09:48,200
I'm going to bring in Dr. Shepherd to see you.

198
00:09:48,324 --> 00:09:50,428
Okay? Dr. Shepherd.

199
00:09:51,313 --> 00:09:52,925
He's the brain specialist.

200
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:54,784
My mommy and daddy.

201
00:09:54,871 --> 00:09:58,168
Doctor? Is he good, this Dr. Shepherd?

202
00:09:59,423 --> 00:10:00,743
At just about everything.

203
00:10:03,255 --> 00:10:07,851
I assume the lady needs her keys to
leave this guy's sorry ass behind.

204
00:10:08,117 --> 00:10:08,767
Yeah.

205
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,083
Well, help her out.

206
00:10:10,395 --> 00:10:12,152
He needs a bronchoscopy.

207
00:10:12,288 --> 00:10:13,816
See one, do one, teach one.

208
00:10:13,892 --> 00:10:15,602
You've seen one. It's time to do one.

209
00:10:15,868 --> 00:10:16,652
Alone?

210
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,983
Seriously?

211
00:10:18,382 --> 00:10:20,927
Thanks. I mean, the vote of
confidence in my skills and all -

212
00:10:20,973 --> 00:10:23,114
I didn't think anyone was noticing how hard -

213
00:10:23,196 --> 00:10:24,624
- Izzie? Go.
- Yeah.

214
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,656
- You paged?
- Where are we?

215
00:10:26,846 --> 00:10:29,923
I did the consult, did the I.V., the
meds, the post-ops, everything.

216
00:10:29,994 --> 00:10:30,825
How is your pit patient?

217
00:10:30,911 --> 00:10:33,302
She's febrile and has peritoneal signs.

218
00:10:33,436 --> 00:10:34,582
You all right, Dr. Yang?

219
00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:35,309
Fine.

220
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:37,664
On my way back to clinic.

221
00:10:38,474 --> 00:10:41,192
I think she had some sort of
illegal surgery done in Mexico.

222
00:10:41,335 --> 00:10:42,210
Botched abortion?

223
00:10:42,298 --> 00:10:44,946
No, she has four laparoscopic scars on her abdomen

224
00:10:45,118 --> 00:10:47,474
and won't say what they're from.
The parents are clueless.

225
00:10:47,535 --> 00:10:50,033
- Oh, she's a minor.
- 17. Freshman in college.

226
00:10:50,102 --> 00:10:51,852
- You order up for a C.T.?
- Yes.

227
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:55,477
So, while she's there, the nurses
couldn't get a Foley on Mr. Gry.

228
00:10:55,548 --> 00:10:57,971
He may need a coude cath if you
can't get a normal one in there.

229
00:10:58,052 --> 00:11:00,447
Write up post-op notes
on all surgical-floor

230
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,865
patients that had surgery
within the last 24 hours.

231
00:11:02,948 --> 00:11:06,131
Be sure to document their EKGs and x-rays.

232
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:07,832
Hunt them down if you can't find them.

233
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:08,734
Right away.

234
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,251
Hey.

235
00:11:13,823 --> 00:11:14,456
Whoa.

236
00:11:15,054 --> 00:11:15,820
Got the flu?

237
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,146
Yeah, and thanks for it.

238
00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:18,558
It's making my life so much easier.

239
00:11:18,908 --> 00:11:21,241
I didn't give it to you.
It's all over the hospital.

240
00:11:21,994 --> 00:11:23,043
You should be in bed.

241
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,556
Disease, diagnosis, and prescription from one man.

242
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:28,901
Seriously, I'll give you a ride home.

243
00:11:29,157 --> 00:11:30,959
This is not gonna make me go home.

244
00:11:31,313 --> 00:11:32,162
You go home.

245
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:34,324
But I feel fine.

246
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:43,969
Hey, hey, hey - have you seen Shepherd?

247
00:11:44,157 --> 00:11:45,690
Not as up close as Meredith has.

248
00:11:45,797 --> 00:11:48,069
What? Are you trying to get her in trouble?
She's our friend.

249
00:11:48,145 --> 00:11:51,574
George, this program will make
or break our careers, okay?

250
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:53,559
Some of us will make it
through, and some of us won't.

251
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:58,090
And that decision depends entirely on
recommendations from doctors like Shepherd.

252
00:11:58,407 --> 00:12:00,108
There is a reason we don't
sleep with the attendings.

253
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:01,593
It's not her fault, it's Shepherd's.

254
00:12:01,685 --> 00:12:03,332
He's the attending. He should know better.

255
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,577
He's taking advantage of her.

256
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:07,829
It didn't exactly sound like anything was
happening against her will last night.

257
00:12:12,447 --> 00:12:15,110
Okay, we're in good shape here.

258
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:16,518
I think so, Dr. Shepherd.

259
00:12:16,754 --> 00:12:17,732
Looks good.

260
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:27,991
Here you go, doc.

261
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:30,061
The kid's C.T.s just arrived from Kennedy.

262
00:12:30,142 --> 00:12:31,213
- Thanks.
- Excuse me.

263
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,389
Sorry, Dr. Taylor.

264
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:35,431
That would be bourbon.

265
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:36,731
What?

266
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:38,028
I smelled it, too.

267
00:12:39,204 --> 00:12:41,842
And he's the best anesthesiologist on the staff.

268
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,765
I'll worry when he's too juiced
to do his crossword puzzle.

269
00:12:52,904 --> 00:12:54,017
Will you close up for me?

270
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,435
Thank you, everyone.

271
00:12:58,476 --> 00:13:00,426
- Dr. Shepherd...
- I got to get some coffee.

272
00:13:01,067 --> 00:13:04,185
Jamie Hayes has been admitted - the
little girl with the brain abnormality.

273
00:13:04,253 --> 00:13:05,116
How's she presenting?

274
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,896
She has what looks like continuous
seizure activity in her left foot.

275
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:12,593
Her balance is off. Her parents have come a
long way to try to find out what's wrong.

276
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:13,531
How old are these?

277
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:14,686
Three months old.

278
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:17,150
I need new ones. Her brain could
look dramatically different today.

279
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:20,686
Okay, I'll order them...

280
00:13:21,522 --> 00:13:22,336
Thank you.

281
00:13:23,954 --> 00:13:24,722
Doc.

282
00:13:27,486 --> 00:13:30,958
And that - that's a bullet
from a previous gunshot.

283
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,622
Previous gunshot? Okay.

284
00:13:32,754 --> 00:13:33,933
No reason to take it out.

285
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,248
No, the guy likes pain.

286
00:13:35,418 --> 00:13:36,441
It's his ethos.

287
00:13:36,626 --> 00:13:37,850
Pain as an ethos?

288
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:40,506
Wait, I think I know this guy.

289
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,224
You remember this guy?

290
00:13:44,608 --> 00:13:46,775
Hey, the tattooed masochist.

291
00:13:47,014 --> 00:13:48,248
Had himself shot again.

292
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:50,158
Glad to see he's still stupid.

293
00:13:50,276 --> 00:13:51,151
It's his ethos.

294
00:13:51,484 --> 00:13:53,195
Let's go tell him what he gets to do today.

295
00:13:53,363 --> 00:13:54,300
Dr. Bailey?

296
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:56,927
Claire rice's abdominal C.T.s.

297
00:13:57,342 --> 00:13:58,765
Is this girl fat?

298
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:01,003
Not at all. She's a normal college kid.

299
00:14:01,386 --> 00:14:02,783
So what do you see?

300
00:14:03,574 --> 00:14:05,125
Her stomach's stapled.

301
00:14:05,462 --> 00:14:07,141
She's had a gastric bypass.

302
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,735
And a bad one, at that.

303
00:14:11,991 --> 00:14:15,692
Gastric bypass is a procedure
normally done on obese patients

304
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:17,320
to help them lose weight.

305
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:18,994
Claire?

306
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:20,985
She doesn't need to lose weight.

307
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:21,986
Are you kidding?

308
00:14:22,368 --> 00:14:24,145
This means the world to her.

309
00:14:24,606 --> 00:14:27,411
But it is so typical of this
girl to take the easy way out.

310
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,885
She's done it with everything
since she was a little kid.

311
00:14:29,987 --> 00:14:32,583
Mrs. Rice, nothing about this is gonna be easy.

312
00:14:32,675 --> 00:14:34,948
She's gonna face a lifelong
struggle with malnutrition

313
00:14:35,015 --> 00:14:37,560
unless she has surgery to reverse the procedure.

314
00:14:37,662 --> 00:14:38,646
Do the surgery.

315
00:14:39,776 --> 00:14:42,255
I told her to watch the freshman 15-

316
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:44,190
don't eat junk, exercise.

317
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:46,813
But when she came home Christmas,
who had to take her out and buy her

318
00:14:46,873 --> 00:14:50,549
a brand-new pair of size-6 jeans because she
couldn't get in the ones I got her last summer?

319
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:53,622
Tina, you know, she tries so hard.

320
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:57,144
She does. She gets good grades. She gets "A"s.

321
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,857
She has illegal surgery in Mexico.

322
00:15:00,504 --> 00:15:04,511
Unfortunately, there were
complications with the bypass.

323
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:06,365
What do you mean?

324
00:15:07,262 --> 00:15:10,349
She has what looks like an
abscess under her diaphragm -

325
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:13,303
an edema, which is a swelling of the bowel wall.

326
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:15,709
I can't say for certain she'll recover completely.

327
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:21,741
Just... do whatever you have
to do to make her well, okay?

328
00:15:24,766 --> 00:15:26,113
You look like a princess.

329
00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:27,240
Do you know you're a princess?

330
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:29,697
It's not lipstick.

331
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,734
It's not lipstick? No, it's not lipstick.

332
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,052
Want to do my shoulder?

333
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:35,149
- Oh, good.
- And nose?

334
00:15:35,453 --> 00:15:37,403
Now, we're gonna find out
what's causing these seizures.

335
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:39,610
Does MRI know we're coming down?

336
00:15:39,696 --> 00:15:40,859
You said C.T.

337
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,035
Now I'm saying MRI.

338
00:15:43,898 --> 00:15:44,978
It's available.

339
00:15:45,739 --> 00:15:46,399
Good.

340
00:15:46,522 --> 00:15:48,145
Doctor, is she gonna need surgery?

341
00:15:48,452 --> 00:15:49,276
I don't know yet.

342
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,943
Well, it's just that my wife and I, we both work.

343
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,587
- And I don't know if our insurance -
- We know it can be very expensive.

344
00:15:53,665 --> 00:15:55,011
I don't want you to worry about that.

345
00:15:57,894 --> 00:16:00,786
It's a focal, left-size seizure. Let's get
that diazepam running right now, please.

346
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:02,941
- A tourniquet, please.
- Tourniquet.

347
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:04,683
Hey, Jamie, here's what we're gonna do.

348
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:06,773
We're gonna put this on your arm, okay?

349
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,082
Isn't that fun?

350
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:09,675
Here, we're gonna put that onto you, like that.

351
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:11,606
And this is gonna feel cold.

352
00:16:11,974 --> 00:16:13,069
This is a butterfly.

353
00:16:14,268 --> 00:16:15,566
Butterfly lands right there.

354
00:16:16,356 --> 00:16:18,650
Mmm, there we go. Blanket for the
butterfly - good. Nicely done.

355
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,114
It's amazing stuff, isn't it?

356
00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:30,030
- Hey, you like spaceships?
- Yeah.

357
00:16:30,058 --> 00:16:33,690
You do? Okay, should we take captain
O’Malley, my first lieutenant,

358
00:16:33,912 --> 00:16:35,816
to the spaceship MRI?

359
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:36,831
Let's go.

360
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:41,638
It'll be safer to wait until your lunch
digests before we do the procedure.

361
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:45,088
Perfect - this is just perfect.

362
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,896
I was hoping to be in Portland right now.

363
00:16:46,987 --> 00:16:50,326
You're gonna be under conscious sedation,
which means you'll be awake, but groggy.

364
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:52,855
Wait, wait. Is this gonna hurt?

365
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:55,575
We'll give you something for pain.

366
00:16:55,693 --> 00:16:57,362
Do you know how stupid you make me look?

367
00:16:57,843 --> 00:16:59,660
I thought you would think this is funny.

368
00:16:59,793 --> 00:17:00,587
Funny?

369
00:17:01,267 --> 00:17:02,179
Romantic?

370
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:04,538
Like the therapist thing was funny and romantic?

371
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,331
- That was funny.
- No, that was sad.

372
00:17:06,434 --> 00:17:09,778
He called my therapist,
pretending to be his therapist,

373
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,309
to find out what I'd said about him.

374
00:17:11,465 --> 00:17:12,874
A little passive-aggressive, isn't it, J.P.?

375
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:15,087
He is the king of passive-aggressive.

376
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:16,546
And he's manipulative...

377
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,995
And needy.

378
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,237
Well, that's the trifecta.

379
00:17:20,344 --> 00:17:21,415
What do I win?

380
00:17:24,707 --> 00:17:25,762
What?

381
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:28,537
Doc!

382
00:17:30,822 --> 00:17:32,935
I prefer we stop meeting like this, Mr. Owens.

383
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:34,077
Digby.

384
00:17:34,806 --> 00:17:36,335
So, how's the trumpet playing?

385
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,772
Very safe, compared to your hobby.

386
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:42,259
Getting shot is a little more risky.

387
00:17:42,347 --> 00:17:43,526
That's kind of the point.

388
00:17:44,153 --> 00:17:45,228
He's running a fever.

389
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,492
Due to the extra stress on
his body from the gunshot.

390
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:48,581
Digby...

391
00:17:50,051 --> 00:17:52,545
the impact of the bullet on your chest

392
00:17:52,694 --> 00:17:55,408
fractured a rib and caused a hemopneumothorax.

393
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,908
That sucks, I guess.

394
00:17:56,984 --> 00:17:58,207
There's blood in your collapsed lung.

395
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,449
The price of body art went
up since your last gunshot.

396
00:18:01,546 --> 00:18:03,277
Ah, no pain, no gain, right?

397
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:04,587
That's one way to look at it.

398
00:18:04,863 --> 00:18:06,907
We have that in common, you docs and me.

399
00:18:07,036 --> 00:18:07,756
Do we?

400
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,962
Yeah, the way you guys push, push, push.

401
00:18:11,248 --> 00:18:12,622
When I was wrestling,

402
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,361
if you wanted to pin me, you
was gonna have to kill me.

403
00:18:15,872 --> 00:18:18,312
- Iowa style.
- Iowa state style.

404
00:18:18,744 --> 00:18:20,920
Back home, we were sworn enemies.

405
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:23,821
But in Seattle, man, we're brothers.

406
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:30,736
So, what are we gonna do about this, um...
hemopneumo-durasis?

407
00:18:30,837 --> 00:18:34,074
We're gonna insert a chest tube to drain
the blood, then reinflate your lung.

408
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:36,669
Oh, please...

409
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:38,959
tell me I get to watch.

410
00:18:44,898 --> 00:18:47,449
Oh, man - Iowa style.

411
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:52,337
Before you guys start, I know you're mad.

412
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,527
Disbelief, Claire - just... disbelief.

413
00:18:55,706 --> 00:18:56,996
I'm just concerned.

414
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:59,704
Where did you get the idea to do this?

415
00:18:59,853 --> 00:19:00,693
The internet.

416
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,948
Honey, there is a healthy way to lose weight.

417
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:09,383
Yeah, I tried that, but...

418
00:19:10,157 --> 00:19:12,593
it doesn't work for me like it does for you.

419
00:19:13,154 --> 00:19:16,048
Hey, you don't need to lose weight.

420
00:19:16,274 --> 00:19:17,441
What are you eating?

421
00:19:17,697 --> 00:19:19,663
And how much have you been working out?

422
00:19:19,786 --> 00:19:24,061
Most of the time, when people hit their target
weight, they have to work to stay there.

423
00:19:24,184 --> 00:19:27,256
Everyone gains weight in college, mom.

424
00:19:28,121 --> 00:19:30,681
It's... stressful.

425
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:35,878
There's - there's not enough time for exercise.

426
00:19:37,772 --> 00:19:41,172
I just thought if I wasn't
worried about my diet, then...

427
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:44,721
I could focus more on my studies.

428
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:46,691
So you took yet another shortcut?

429
00:19:47,317 --> 00:19:49,174
Life doesn't work that way, Claire.

430
00:19:49,262 --> 00:19:49,989
Tina!

431
00:19:50,137 --> 00:19:51,981
What? You want to argue this?

432
00:19:53,598 --> 00:19:56,400
She has so much potential. If
she would just apply herself...

433
00:19:56,482 --> 00:20:01,709
Okay, I think we should focus on
taking care of your daughter.

434
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,684
And, Claire, your parents agree -

435
00:20:04,823 --> 00:20:08,068
the best thing to do is to reverse the bypass.

436
00:20:08,205 --> 00:20:08,991
No!

437
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,734
No, it's my body.

438
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,067
I do not want surgery again. Please?

439
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,530
There are serious complications.

440
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:19,685
And this is about your health.

441
00:20:19,993 --> 00:20:21,473
But I'd rather be thin.

442
00:20:21,795 --> 00:20:24,022
Well, I'm afraid the choice isn't up to you.

443
00:20:37,682 --> 00:20:39,741
It's called rasmussin's encephalitis.

444
00:20:40,404 --> 00:20:43,002
What it amounts to is that
this side of her brain -

445
00:20:43,217 --> 00:20:45,158
this part's all healthy, it's working perfectly.

446
00:20:45,306 --> 00:20:48,961
This black part of the brain, this
- all of that is dead, or dying.

447
00:20:49,438 --> 00:20:53,360
The condition has gotten radically worse
since her C.T. scans three months ago.

448
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:56,457
Left untreated, the disease is gonna kill her.

449
00:20:57,943 --> 00:20:58,802
How soon?

450
00:20:59,504 --> 00:21:00,333
Too soon.

451
00:21:01,704 --> 00:21:03,543
So, is there a cure?

452
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:08,070
The treatment requires the diseased portion
of her brain be removed and sealed off.

453
00:21:08,515 --> 00:21:11,838
See, eventually, the spinal
fluid will fill the cavity.

454
00:21:12,243 --> 00:21:14,592
Remove? But, I mean, that's -

455
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:16,210
Half her brain, yes.

456
00:21:24,586 --> 00:21:28,430
Half her brain - that... seems impossible.

457
00:21:28,702 --> 00:21:30,161
Her age makes it possible.

458
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,236
Her brain's not fully developed,

459
00:21:32,307 --> 00:21:35,522
so the remaining neurons will
compensate for the loss.

460
00:21:36,331 --> 00:21:37,749
But will she be normal?

461
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:41,574
There are risks to any surgery, and
this is, you know, a major one.

462
00:21:41,672 --> 00:21:43,540
But if, you know, we're successful,

463
00:21:43,653 --> 00:21:47,395
Jamie could walk out of this hospital in a couple
weeks, go on to live a relatively normal life.

464
00:21:47,611 --> 00:21:49,218
Look, I know this is a lot to digest.

465
00:21:49,316 --> 00:21:51,578
The important thing to remember
is that we can save her life.

466
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:52,440
Thank you.

467
00:21:52,751 --> 00:21:53,708
Dr. O’Malley?

468
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:54,983
Yes? What?

469
00:21:55,434 --> 00:21:56,439
I'm sorry to bother you.

470
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,736
But if the parents consent, I thought you'd
like to scrub in on the hemispherectomy.

471
00:22:00,484 --> 00:22:01,589
Are you in, or not?

472
00:22:01,951 --> 00:22:02,848
Uh, in.

473
00:22:03,933 --> 00:22:04,686
Good.

474
00:22:12,868 --> 00:22:13,620
Yang.

475
00:22:14,107 --> 00:22:17,118
I'm scrubbing in on a
hemispherectomy with Shepherd.

476
00:22:17,451 --> 00:22:19,160
Get out! I would kill for that.

477
00:22:19,246 --> 00:22:22,621
We're gonna cut out half a girl's
brain and it's going to work.

478
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:24,229
It's outrageous.

479
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:26,999
Almost makes it hard to hate him.

480
00:22:27,424 --> 00:22:28,479
Why do you hate him?

481
00:22:28,571 --> 00:22:29,401
Oh, no reason.

482
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,650
You know about him and Meredith?

483
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:33,414
You know?

484
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:36,021
When are you gonna figure
out that I know everything?

485
00:22:36,108 --> 00:22:36,886
She knows.

486
00:22:37,281 --> 00:22:38,545
What, about doctor-cest?

487
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,999
It's been going on for, like, ever.

488
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:41,760
And you didn't tell us?

489
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:43,039
Ooh, you're a gossip, huh?

490
00:22:43,118 --> 00:22:44,573
- I am not!
- I am.

491
00:22:45,578 --> 00:22:47,889
He's about to go into major
brain surgery on no sleep?

492
00:22:48,135 --> 00:22:49,436
Not very responsible.

493
00:22:49,615 --> 00:22:50,618
Jealous much?

494
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:52,390
Sex all night isn't about being responsible.

495
00:22:52,477 --> 00:22:53,997
No, it's about sex all night.

496
00:22:54,075 --> 00:22:56,435
I can't believe you're not
more pissed off about this.

497
00:22:56,493 --> 00:22:58,897
Well, she works hard all day.
She's got a hard job.

498
00:22:58,963 --> 00:23:00,715
Why should you care how she unwinds?

499
00:23:00,823 --> 00:23:03,235
I mean, you like to bake all night.
Some people like to drink.

500
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:05,109
Others like an occasional screaming orgasm.

501
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:05,957
Yeah, we do.

502
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:09,311
Forget I said that.

503
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:10,704
Pretend like I'm not here.

504
00:23:11,324 --> 00:23:12,127
Continue.

505
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:15,394
You look like you need to be spoon-fed.

506
00:23:16,551 --> 00:23:17,739
You look like Alex.

507
00:23:18,098 --> 00:23:21,641
Yeah, about drinking
- Dr. Taylor, the anesthesiologist -

508
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:23,606
do you think he drinks?

509
00:23:23,765 --> 00:23:25,317
Whatever gets you through the day.

510
00:23:25,389 --> 00:23:28,306
I mean here, at work. Earlier,
I thought I smelled -

511
00:23:29,085 --> 00:23:32,649
Do you think - I mean, his patients trust that -

512
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:36,566
So I should say something, right?

513
00:23:36,877 --> 00:23:38,220
It's a can of worms, George.

514
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:41,419
Weren't we talking about sex, anyway?

515
00:23:42,651 --> 00:23:44,026
- Doofus.
- Ew.

516
00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:50,783
This is gonna leave a pretty sexy scar, huh?

517
00:23:51,071 --> 00:23:53,000
Don't get any more crazy ideas.

518
00:23:53,702 --> 00:23:55,622
You really think my ideas are crazy?

519
00:23:55,953 --> 00:23:57,291
I'm leaning that way.

520
00:23:57,552 --> 00:23:59,375
We wrestle, he plays trumpet.

521
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:02,242
Hey, I feel pretty dizzy.

522
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,050
You've lost some blood.

523
00:24:05,503 --> 00:24:07,337
This, too, shall pass.

524
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,129
Hey...

525
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,020
how come I don't see you
down at the mat in belltown?

526
00:24:13,266 --> 00:24:14,449
Oh, man, no time.

527
00:24:14,597 --> 00:24:15,960
Bro, make time.

528
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,551
I'll be expecting you.

529
00:24:19,277 --> 00:24:20,146
I'm there.

530
00:24:25,358 --> 00:24:26,619
Handle with care.

531
00:24:26,695 --> 00:24:29,087
This thing's full of gunk. I know.

532
00:24:29,312 --> 00:24:33,614
We need to free the bowel from the
adhesions caused from the abscess.

533
00:24:34,135 --> 00:24:35,267
This poor girl...

534
00:24:36,732 --> 00:24:37,914
What was she thinking?

535
00:24:38,031 --> 00:24:39,681
She wants her mother's approval.

536
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:41,329
She wanted to please her.

537
00:24:41,431 --> 00:24:42,936
And this damage is the result?

538
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:45,482
Here, resect that.

539
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,217
Needle-tip over here, please.

540
00:24:47,916 --> 00:24:50,842
When you're done here, you have post-ops waiting.

541
00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:52,633
I know, Dr. Bailey.

542
00:24:52,731 --> 00:24:55,609
Cristina's got the flu, so you need
to pick up the slack in the clinic.

543
00:24:55,705 --> 00:24:58,016
Look, I'll mop the floors, okay?

544
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,230
Sorry, that was inappropriate.

545
00:25:01,323 --> 00:25:03,319
It's not the only thing that's inappropriate.

546
00:25:06,315 --> 00:25:09,064
You care to tell me what you think you're doing?

547
00:25:09,137 --> 00:25:11,337
I'll jump through hoops if you want me to.

548
00:25:11,435 --> 00:25:14,190
But what I do what I leave
this hospital is my business.

549
00:25:14,277 --> 00:25:16,287
Half this hospital knows your business.

550
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,932
Flu isn't the only virus spreading around here.

551
00:25:19,171 --> 00:25:22,837
I made a choice, and I know you
don't respect me for that choice.

552
00:25:23,006 --> 00:25:25,162
But I'll live with the consequences.

553
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:27,716
Then I'll have lots of hoops
for you to jump through.

554
00:25:27,783 --> 00:25:29,631
I've done everything you've asked me to do.

555
00:25:29,713 --> 00:25:32,188
I may not do it your way, but it gets done.

556
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,874
So whatever else you got, bring it on.

557
00:25:40,135 --> 00:25:44,296
Okay, Dr. Grey, now that you've drained the organ,

558
00:25:44,487 --> 00:25:46,181
we can attempt to repair it.

559
00:25:46,728 --> 00:25:48,940
Now my day is perfect.

560
00:25:55,516 --> 00:25:56,607
I appreciate this.

561
00:25:57,353 --> 00:26:00,334
The chance to scrub in on this
kind of procedure is, well -

562
00:26:01,286 --> 00:26:02,611
yeah, I appreciate it.

563
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:06,284
Here you go. Triple espresso, not too hot.

564
00:26:06,355 --> 00:26:07,727
Oh, I love you, seriously.

565
00:26:08,203 --> 00:26:11,542
Ah, coffee - where would
medicine be without it, huh?

566
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:13,702
I hope you have a new crossword, Taylor.

567
00:26:13,953 --> 00:26:15,032
We're gonna be here awhile.

568
00:26:15,151 --> 00:26:16,292
Never go without.

569
00:26:16,614 --> 00:26:18,598
Big day for you, kid - congrats.

570
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:19,488
Thanks.

571
00:26:19,907 --> 00:26:20,870
Hey, princess.

572
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:22,683
You ready to take a nap?

573
00:26:22,772 --> 00:26:24,946
Hey, look what I got. Blow bubbles - that's it.

574
00:26:25,028 --> 00:26:27,004
You just breathe in. Oh, that's it.

575
00:26:27,496 --> 00:26:28,114
What?

576
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:30,495
- Do you smell...
- Smell what?

577
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:31,565
I have a mask.

578
00:26:37,461 --> 00:26:40,962
I'm sorry, Dr. Taylor, but did you just...

579
00:26:42,783 --> 00:26:43,936
Have you been drinking?

580
00:26:45,492 --> 00:26:46,599
I beg your pardon?

581
00:26:47,177 --> 00:26:47,940
What?

582
00:26:48,114 --> 00:26:51,273
Do you smell - I-I smell alcohol.

583
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,007
Where the hell do you get off
accusing me of something like that?

584
00:26:55,968 --> 00:26:57,561
George, you're out of line.

585
00:26:57,873 --> 00:26:59,005
There are rules.

586
00:26:59,424 --> 00:27:01,351
You know, there are rules for a reason. You ju-

587
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:07,159
There is a 2-year-old girl on this table.

588
00:27:08,747 --> 00:27:11,614
You shouldn't take advantage of
someone else's vulnerability.

589
00:27:11,707 --> 00:27:14,606
I don't need some punk intern
telling me what's at stake here.

590
00:27:15,014 --> 00:27:16,546
Get him out of here, Shep.

591
00:27:19,735 --> 00:27:20,492
Shep?

592
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:23,457
You're out, George.

593
00:27:32,961 --> 00:27:34,635
You damned well better be ready, Taylor.

594
00:27:34,728 --> 00:27:36,492
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

595
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:44,199
Do you really, seriously want to
know why I'm leaving?! Seriously?

596
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:47,046
How about when you started
insisting that I quit my job,

597
00:27:47,107 --> 00:27:48,863
right when I started to make more money than you?

598
00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:51,116
That should have been the last straw.

599
00:27:51,182 --> 00:27:54,844
No, the last straw should have been when I
found out that those mysterious phone calls

600
00:27:54,895 --> 00:27:57,536
that you've been getting that you
kept denying were from other women -

601
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,564
were really coming from your mother!

602
00:28:00,066 --> 00:28:01,161
This isn't healthy.

603
00:28:01,243 --> 00:28:03,803
- Just hold still, please.
- Don't you dare try to patch this up!

604
00:28:03,864 --> 00:28:05,504
Okay, could the both of you just please stop?

605
00:28:05,565 --> 00:28:08,560
You don't love me, J.P. You love to smother me.

606
00:28:08,616 --> 00:28:10,768
And if I could get you to just admit that,

607
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:13,476
then I could leave you with an ounce of respect.

608
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,791
Athena, I let you stay in here to keep him calm.

609
00:28:15,856 --> 00:28:17,541
- So if you're just gonna keep arguing -
- Check that -

610
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:21,801
I can't respect a man desperate
enough to swallow my exit strategy.

611
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,743
That is the last straw!

612
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:25,601
Michelle, can you get her out of here?

613
00:28:26,054 --> 00:28:26,885
Ma'am?

614
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,446
Fine!

615
00:28:30,512 --> 00:28:31,708
- Come on.
- What?

616
00:28:33,844 --> 00:28:34,715
What's happening?

617
00:28:35,272 --> 00:28:36,608
The keys moved farther down.

618
00:28:36,777 --> 00:28:37,989
Oh, my god, what does that mean?

619
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:41,692
What did you do? Don't you dare die, J.P.!

620
00:28:41,764 --> 00:28:43,755
Please! Please, just shut up!

621
00:28:43,843 --> 00:28:46,064
Breathe, J.P. Just breathe.

622
00:28:49,075 --> 00:28:49,885
Got it.

623
00:28:57,545 --> 00:28:59,086
Very impressive, J.P.

624
00:29:00,428 --> 00:29:02,440
Is he okay? Is he gonna be okay?

625
00:29:02,522 --> 00:29:04,065
Yeah, he'll be fine.

626
00:29:10,621 --> 00:29:14,308
You lit- you did that on purpose, didn't you?

627
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,679
Can I offer you some advice?

628
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:20,022
Get in your car and go,

629
00:29:20,154 --> 00:29:21,568
for all of our sakes.

630
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,485
You'll never know where I parked it.

631
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:33,743
- I need a shower.
- I need a shower.

632
00:29:33,825 --> 00:29:37,229
You need to go tell that girl's parents
what kind of kid they're getting back.

633
00:29:37,303 --> 00:29:38,976
You're not gonna let me shower first?

634
00:29:39,067 --> 00:29:41,226
That would be a hoop, would it not?

635
00:29:41,634 --> 00:29:43,067
It would qualify.

636
00:29:43,944 --> 00:29:45,535
Shower first, then.

637
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:50,695
Ew, what smells?

638
00:29:50,854 --> 00:29:55,130
That would be me - or more specifically,
my patient's insides all over me.

639
00:29:56,098 --> 00:29:57,776
That makes me strangely happy.

640
00:29:58,095 --> 00:30:01,955
Oh, god. Oh, Meredith, you smell like...

641
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:02,934
Karma.

642
00:30:03,173 --> 00:30:04,617
- What?
- Nothing.

643
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:06,594
Something vile's stuck in your hair.

644
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,605
You know, just go stand over there, please.

645
00:30:12,661 --> 00:30:16,342
Ugh, how much do I love being a surgeon right now?

646
00:30:16,818 --> 00:30:17,761
Karma.

647
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,581
What does karma have to do with anything?

648
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:23,526
I'm just saying, you've been
given all the best surgeries.

649
00:30:23,643 --> 00:30:28,134
And now you smell like putrid goo
and you're giving off a stench.

650
00:30:28,221 --> 00:30:29,102
Karma's a bitch.

651
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:32,849
Dr. Shepherd needs an intern in surgery.

652
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:33,991
Which one of you is clear to go?

653
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:35,235
Okay, Dr. Bailey, where do you want me?

654
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:36,699
You need to lie down somewhere.

655
00:30:36,755 --> 00:30:38,419
I'm fine. I'm completely healthy.

656
00:30:38,824 --> 00:30:39,582
Grey?

657
00:30:39,762 --> 00:30:40,974
Of course.

658
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:42,880
What is your problem?

659
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,420
Um, you!

660
00:30:44,578 --> 00:30:49,013
'Cause apparently, you can help
Dr. Mcdreamy in ways the rest of us can't.

661
00:30:49,989 --> 00:30:52,648
- You did not just s-
- Yes, I did!

662
00:30:52,776 --> 00:30:53,570
Hey!

663
00:30:54,624 --> 00:30:57,768
Hemispherectomy in O.R. one
with Dr. Shepherd - go.

664
00:31:07,147 --> 00:31:08,710
Apparently...

665
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,070
I'm not the only one with hoops.

666
00:31:18,049 --> 00:31:18,786
Doctor...

667
00:31:20,482 --> 00:31:24,344
Digby's post-op CBC shows a severe
spike in the white blood cell count.

668
00:31:24,423 --> 00:31:25,094
What is it?

669
00:31:25,196 --> 00:31:27,275
It's 27, with 16% bands.

670
00:31:27,644 --> 00:31:28,897
Something else is wrong.

671
00:31:29,082 --> 00:31:30,634
That's a little high for simple stress.

672
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,747
Check for any other possible sources
of infection or recent illness.

673
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,597
We're gonna start the procedure
with the left temporal lobectomy.

674
00:31:40,752 --> 00:31:42,396
Thanks for joining us, Dr. Yang.

675
00:31:43,055 --> 00:31:45,390
After the temporal, we'll do the frontal,

676
00:31:45,866 --> 00:31:47,597
and then the occipital.

677
00:32:00,775 --> 00:32:02,885
We were able to reverse the gastric bypass,

678
00:32:02,952 --> 00:32:05,246
but we did lose a significant
portion of her bowel.

679
00:32:05,327 --> 00:32:09,221
And because of the short gut syndrome,
Claire will never eat normally again.

680
00:32:09,936 --> 00:32:13,605
Okay, wait, do - how do we help her here?

681
00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:17,304
Well, getting proper nutrition will
be a lifelong problem for Claire.

682
00:32:17,386 --> 00:32:20,241
Great - as if we already don't
have our hands full with her.

683
00:32:21,062 --> 00:32:22,909
She gets good grades.

684
00:32:23,585 --> 00:32:25,214
She stays out of trouble.

685
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,591
She's smart.

686
00:32:27,118 --> 00:32:30,344
I just think she feels like nothing
she does is good enough for you.

687
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:33,359
If you somehow think that
I'm responsible for this -

688
00:32:33,467 --> 00:32:35,557
I think Claire is killing herself...

689
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:36,959
to please you.

690
00:32:37,425 --> 00:32:38,490
Please.

691
00:32:41,214 --> 00:32:43,983
You have no idea what's going
on in that girl's mind.

692
00:32:44,169 --> 00:32:45,294
You're her mother.

693
00:32:45,873 --> 00:32:48,090
She worships the ground you walk on.

694
00:32:49,775 --> 00:32:51,776
She didn't do this for herself.

695
00:32:56,252 --> 00:32:58,580
I think that this situation
is completely ridiculous.

696
00:32:58,593 --> 00:33:00,931
Tina... shut up.

697
00:33:09,356 --> 00:33:10,193
What is it?

698
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,199
I'm freezing, doc. I-I-I can't stop shaking.

699
00:33:13,276 --> 00:33:15,769
His temp's way up and B.P.'s dropping, doctor.

700
00:33:15,846 --> 00:33:20,367
All right, Digby, have you had any recent
illnesses, new piercings, tattoos, wounds?

701
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:21,978
New tat on my calf.

702
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,686
Oh, my god.

703
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,048
It was nowhere near that nasty this morning.

704
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:35,118
But it was infected?

705
00:33:35,266 --> 00:33:36,209
Why didn't you say anything?

706
00:33:36,296 --> 00:33:37,335
Ah, it was nothing.

707
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,781
I'm not here to complain about a little pain.

708
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:44,451
Well, the infection's been exacerbated by
the stress on your body from the gunshot.

709
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:45,982
Get him to ICU.

710
00:33:46,908 --> 00:33:48,818
We'll get you started on some antibiotics.

711
00:33:55,506 --> 00:33:58,956
From the frontal lobectomy, I'm
going to encounter a, uh...

712
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:01,552
We'll encounter the anterior cerebral artery.

713
00:34:01,655 --> 00:34:03,503
Yes, so we're gonna need to, uh...

714
00:34:06,284 --> 00:34:09,063
The branches of the artery need
to be coagulated and divided.

715
00:34:09,534 --> 00:34:11,690
You know, Taylor, her anesthesia's awful light.

716
00:34:14,748 --> 00:34:16,622
Come on, Taylor, she's waking up.

717
00:34:20,318 --> 00:34:21,254
Dr. Taylor?

718
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,492
Uh, he's asleep!

719
00:34:24,782 --> 00:34:25,540
Taylor!

720
00:34:34,479 --> 00:34:35,703
Dr. Taylor!

721
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:39,154
Oh, god, sorry. Sorry, I'm on it.

722
00:34:40,987 --> 00:34:41,920
My bad, Shep.

723
00:34:43,726 --> 00:34:44,751
He was right, wasn't he?

724
00:34:45,841 --> 00:34:47,347
Aw, I nodded off. Come on.

725
00:34:47,413 --> 00:34:49,051
Whatever you got to do to
get through the day, right?

726
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,378
Steph, get me some coffee.

727
00:34:50,459 --> 00:34:51,273
Yes, doctor.

728
00:34:51,816 --> 00:34:53,414
I'll be fine. It won't happen again.

729
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,704
Yeah, not in here, it won't.

730
00:34:54,991 --> 00:34:57,156
Uh, Steph, call Dr. Pennington.

731
00:34:57,336 --> 00:34:59,404
Hopkins, take over until she gets here.

732
00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:01,052
Get out of here and get it together.

733
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,337
What happened?

734
00:35:09,413 --> 00:35:12,690
He went into multisymptom organ failure,
secondary to overwhelming sepsis.

735
00:35:12,952 --> 00:35:13,960
Now he's all...

736
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,464
I'll fix his B.P., that should
help his mental status.

737
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:17,636
He's maxxed out...

738
00:35:18,974 --> 00:35:19,935
We got v-tach.

739
00:35:20,687 --> 00:35:21,681
He's looking bad.

740
00:35:21,958 --> 00:35:24,252
Put the defib pads on him and give him 150...

741
00:35:26,632 --> 00:35:27,768
I lost his pulse.

742
00:35:28,181 --> 00:35:30,170
Defib! Get the pads! Get the pads!

743
00:36:01,122 --> 00:36:04,551
This packing, we hope, will, uh...
prevent hemorrhaging.

744
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:06,048
Dr. Yang, do you want to add something to that?

745
00:36:06,134 --> 00:36:09,615
It will allow the cerebral spinal
fluid to eventually fill the cavity.

746
00:36:09,774 --> 00:36:10,660
Very nice.

747
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:12,252
E.T., you want to close up?

748
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:13,142
Yes, doctor.

749
00:36:13,517 --> 00:36:14,442
I'm gonna go to bed.

750
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,474
That was... unreal.

751
00:36:17,561 --> 00:36:19,994
I mean, that's - that's all there is.

752
00:36:20,101 --> 00:36:23,331
I was feeling sick until I came here.

753
00:36:23,429 --> 00:36:24,182
I was tired.

754
00:36:24,898 --> 00:36:26,029
Now I'm tired again.

755
00:36:26,491 --> 00:36:27,729
It's back to reality.

756
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:36,828
- Let me explain.
- It's fine.

757
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,241
No, there is a code among doctors.

758
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:42,245
We're not supposed to ask each other questions,
not within the walls of this hospital.

759
00:36:42,379 --> 00:36:43,715
Okay, I was out of line.

760
00:36:43,812 --> 00:36:45,098
No, you weren't. I was.

761
00:36:46,326 --> 00:36:47,524
I was out of line.

762
00:36:48,348 --> 00:36:50,247
Somebody should have taken responsibility,

763
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,137
and it should have been the guy doing the cutting.

764
00:36:52,187 --> 00:36:53,089
It should have been me.

765
00:36:54,026 --> 00:36:55,927
You didn't deserve what happened to you today.

766
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,538
You did the right thing, code or no code.

767
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,946
You saw me leave the house
this morning, didn't you?

768
00:37:11,535 --> 00:37:12,662
Oh, was that you?

769
00:37:16,173 --> 00:37:17,484
I'm not using her.

770
00:37:18,565 --> 00:37:20,284
And I don't favor her.

771
00:37:22,364 --> 00:37:23,962
She's pretty great, you know.

772
00:37:26,886 --> 00:37:30,422
So, let's go tell Jamie's parents she's
gonna be fine, barring any complications.

773
00:37:34,396 --> 00:37:35,527
Did you fix me?

774
00:37:35,778 --> 00:37:37,411
No, not completely.

775
00:37:37,866 --> 00:37:40,351
So... I won't get fat?

776
00:37:41,646 --> 00:37:42,445
No.

777
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,829
Oh... that's awesome.

778
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:50,503
Claire, I've asked social
services to contact your parents.

779
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:52,577
Why?

780
00:37:52,863 --> 00:37:54,026
They can help you.

781
00:37:54,819 --> 00:37:55,803
With what?

782
00:37:58,349 --> 00:37:59,981
You don't know this yet,

783
00:38:00,892 --> 00:38:03,498
but life isn't supposed to be like this.

784
00:38:04,804 --> 00:38:06,796
It's not supposed to be this hard.

785
00:38:13,733 --> 00:38:15,775
Time of death, 20:49.

786
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,270
The first guy I ever met out here from back home.

787
00:38:35,364 --> 00:38:37,106
I thought you'd be asleep by now.

788
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,396
Yeah, well... I'm not.

789
00:38:41,701 --> 00:38:43,537
If you wait a few minutes, you
can have a piece of cake.

790
00:38:43,608 --> 00:38:44,986
Baked it chock-full of love...

791
00:38:45,773 --> 00:38:51,119
Actually, chock-full of unrelenting, all-consuming
rage and hostility, but it's still tasty.

792
00:38:51,739 --> 00:38:53,162
- So, you know?
- I know.

793
00:38:54,785 --> 00:38:57,868
Well, do you want the long, sordid
version, or the short version,

794
00:38:57,929 --> 00:39:01,083
where I started sleeping with a
guy who turned out to be my boss?

795
00:39:01,165 --> 00:39:01,919
Neither.

796
00:39:02,665 --> 00:39:04,729
Izzie, cut me some slack here.

797
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:05,645
No.

798
00:39:05,828 --> 00:39:07,079
You went to Dartmouth.

799
00:39:07,269 --> 00:39:08,564
Your mother is Ellis Grey.

800
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,908
You grew up - look at this house!

801
00:39:11,221 --> 00:39:12,946
You know, you walk into the O.R.,

802
00:39:13,008 --> 00:39:15,384
and there isn't anyone who
doubts that you should be there.

803
00:39:16,238 --> 00:39:19,402
I grew up in a trailer park.
I went to state school.

804
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:22,315
I put myself through med school
by posing in my underwear.

805
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:25,536
You know, I walk into the O.R.,
and everyone hopes I'm the nurse.

806
00:39:26,084 --> 00:39:30,042
You have their respect without even trying,
and you're throwing it away for...

807
00:39:30,216 --> 00:39:32,187
what, a few good surgeries?

808
00:39:32,263 --> 00:39:32,986
No.

809
00:39:33,427 --> 00:39:34,962
It's not about the surgeries.

810
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:36,825
It's not about getting ahead.

811
00:39:36,918 --> 00:39:37,808
Then what?

812
00:39:38,469 --> 00:39:39,929
A little hot sex?

813
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:43,206
You're willing to ruin your credibility over that?

814
00:39:44,107 --> 00:39:46,887
I mean, Meredith, what the hell are you doing?

815
00:39:50,707 --> 00:39:51,847
Oh, my god...

816
00:39:53,072 --> 00:39:54,495
you're falling for him.

817
00:39:54,598 --> 00:39:56,200
I am not.

818
00:39:56,247 --> 00:39:57,567
Oh, you so are.

819
00:39:57,752 --> 00:39:59,258
No, I'm not.

820
00:39:59,937 --> 00:40:01,264
You so are.

821
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:04,832
Damn it, you poor girl.

822
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:08,509
You know, it's just that he's just so...

823
00:40:09,334 --> 00:40:12,297
and I'm just - I'm having a hard time.

824
00:40:13,271 --> 00:40:15,993
Wow, you're all, uh, mushy and...

825
00:40:16,363 --> 00:40:17,260
warm and...

826
00:40:18,288 --> 00:40:19,619
full of secret feelings.

827
00:40:24,698 --> 00:40:25,733
I hate you!

828
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,216
And your cake.

829
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,214
My cake is good.

830
00:40:31,376 --> 00:40:34,057
So, um, how hot is the sex?

831
00:40:36,091 --> 00:40:36,808
Izzie...

832
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:39,141
What? Come on, I'm not getting any.

833
00:40:39,511 --> 00:40:41,538
Help a girl out with a few details.

834
00:40:49,269 --> 00:40:50,954
Maybe we like the pain.

835
00:40:56,233 --> 00:40:57,380
- How's she doing?
- Good.

836
00:40:58,374 --> 00:40:59,059
Good.

837
00:40:59,756 --> 00:41:01,639
Maybe we're wired that way...

838
00:41:05,074 --> 00:41:05,842
Christina?

839
00:41:13,441 --> 00:41:14,736
...because without it,

840
00:41:15,278 --> 00:41:16,073
I don't know...

841
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,632
...maybe we just wouldn't feel real.

842
00:41:33,504 --> 00:41:35,432
- You know, we could just...
- Sleep?

843
00:41:36,917 --> 00:41:39,492
We could, yeah, if you want to.

844
00:41:39,676 --> 00:41:40,424
Yeah?

845
00:41:45,038 --> 00:41:46,214
What's that saying?

846
00:41:46,808 --> 00:41:49,180
"Why do I keep hitting myself with a hammer?"

847
00:41:49,609 --> 00:41:51,181
Oh, thank god.

848
00:41:53,158 --> 00:41:56,553
"Because it feels so good when I stop."
