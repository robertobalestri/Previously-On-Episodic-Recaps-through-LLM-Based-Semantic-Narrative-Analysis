1
00:00:00,139 --> 00:00:01,968
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,014 --> 00:00:04,395
I've had this thing for my roommate since day one,

3
00:00:04,457 --> 00:00:06,770
and I can't tell her.

4
00:00:07,764 --> 00:00:09,413
Wouldn't it be easier to just ask her out?

5
00:00:09,797 --> 00:00:12,326
Are really as shallow and callous as you seem?

6
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:15,515
Oh, you want to go out for a drink later and

7
00:00:15,671 --> 00:00:17,052
hear about my secret pain?

8
00:00:17,124 --> 00:00:18,635
I can't. I'm seeing someone.

9
00:00:18,716 --> 00:00:20,170
Save yourself the misery, man.

10
00:00:20,252 --> 00:00:21,378
She's off the market.

11
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:23,371
What? But she's not. I mean, if she was...

12
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,242
I live with her -- I would know it.

13
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:27,750
And the longer this little fling goes on,

14
00:00:27,814 --> 00:00:30,702
the more favors you get over the others --

15
00:00:30,753 --> 00:00:33,364
who are fighting tooth and nail just to make it through this program --

16
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:36,518
when those people start finding out what's going on...

17
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:38,924
What is this that we're doing here?

18
00:00:39,318 --> 00:00:40,727
You need a definition?

19
00:00:40,794 --> 00:00:43,789
The next time I see you favoring Meredith Grey in any way,

20
00:00:43,937 --> 00:00:46,958
I'll make sure she doesn't see the inside of an O.R. for a month.

21
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:54,868
Okay, anyone who says you can sleep when you die,

22
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:58,428
tell them to come talk to me after a few months as an intern.

23
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,644
Of course, it's not just the job that keeps us up all night.

24
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:05,732
You have to get up now.

25
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:08,478
What?

26
00:01:08,928 --> 00:01:10,290
Oh, my god, what time is it?

27
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:13,310
It's 5:20,

28
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:15,621
and I have prerounds.

29
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:18,969
And you have to leave before they see you.

30
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,239
Oh, come on, now.

31
00:01:21,323 --> 00:01:22,641
Why don't you just let them see?

32
00:01:22,718 --> 00:01:23,410
No!

33
00:01:23,488 --> 00:01:24,836
- Please!
- No. No.

34
00:01:26,328 --> 00:01:27,534
You get any sleep?

35
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,130
Oh, she could oil the bedsprings as a courtesy or at least buy a padded headboard.

36
00:01:35,538 --> 00:01:36,478
So, who's the guy?

37
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:38,854
You think it was just one guy doing all that work?

38
00:01:38,923 --> 00:01:40,580
Do you mind if I don't think about that?

39
00:01:40,898 --> 00:01:42,306
Oh, jealous?

40
00:01:42,577 --> 00:01:43,575
I'm not jealous.

41
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:44,523
I am.

42
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,395
But at least I know she'll be having a long day at work.

43
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,185
Well, at least we know brain surgery isn't his only skill.

44
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:06,036
They can't be -- he's her boss.

45
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,205
We're late.

46
00:02:07,547 --> 00:02:08,915
He's all of our boss.

47
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,211
She has been scrubbing in a lot lately on his surgeries.

48
00:02:13,272 --> 00:02:15,611
No, Meredith wouldn't sleep with him just to -- no.

49
00:02:15,683 --> 00:02:18,014
If she's not ashamed of it, why is she keeping it a secret?

50
00:02:18,197 --> 00:02:19,242
Maybe she didn't.

51
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:21,181
Maybe it just happened --

52
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:24,592
you know, spontaneously, last night.

53
00:02:25,903 --> 00:02:27,542
- Hi. Good morning.
- Morning.

54
00:02:29,288 --> 00:02:33,051
It sounded like you were having pretty radical sex last night, all night long.

55
00:02:33,508 --> 00:02:34,412
Who was the guy?

56
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:35,713
No one you know.

57
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,681
We're late. Let's go.

58
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:41,156
I mean, if life's so hard already,

59
00:02:41,222 --> 00:02:43,758
why do we bring more trouble down on ourselves?

60
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:46,572
What's up with the need to hit the self-destruct button?

61
00:02:46,635 --> 00:02:49,337
Yikes, wouldn't want to meet you in a dark alley.

62
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,301
Right back at you.

63
00:02:50,405 --> 00:02:51,903
A run? You run?

64
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,839
Every day, babe, every day.

65
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,409
Not suffering enough?

66
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:57,913
What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.

67
00:02:57,996 --> 00:02:59,634
Don't go acting all indefatigable.

68
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:01,436
You're dragging like the rest of us.

69
00:03:01,517 --> 00:03:04,545
Oh, what is that -- professional weakness, Dr. Yang?

70
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,167
- It's called the flu.
- Yeah.

71
00:03:07,131 --> 00:03:09,685
I need a major rush to make it through this day.

72
00:03:10,802 --> 00:03:12,106
I need a kick-ass surgery.

73
00:03:12,183 --> 00:03:13,919
Ooh, you a bad boy last night, George?

74
00:03:14,303 --> 00:03:15,265
That would be Meredith.

75
00:03:16,172 --> 00:03:17,375
You a bad boy, Meredith?

76
00:03:18,747 --> 00:03:19,602
Do tell.

77
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,051
Nothing to tell.

78
00:03:21,148 --> 00:03:22,342
That says it all, huh?

79
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:25,787
Sorry, I have a sex life.

80
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:26,970
Don't apologize.

81
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,060
Embrace it.

82
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:29,048
Share it.

83
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:30,518
Count me in.

84
00:03:31,251 --> 00:03:35,992
Yeah. Next time, just let me know if I need to go to a hotel so I can get some sleep.

85
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:40,369
- Am I missing something?
- You were just a little loud.

86
00:03:43,904 --> 00:03:46,564
Do they know it's Mcdreamy keeping them up all night?

87
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:48,812
I hope not.

88
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:50,410
I already have Bailey riding me.

89
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:53,445
I don't need my roommates thinking I'm getting special treatment.

90
00:03:56,585 --> 00:03:59,657
O'malley, Yang, Karev -- go on to clinic.

91
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:03,439
O'malley, patients are waiting.

92
00:04:04,398 --> 00:04:05,738
You two come with me.

93
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:07,602
Izzie, you're hanging with me today.

94
00:04:08,059 --> 00:04:09,564
Good morning, Dr. Shepherd.

95
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,322
Dr. Bailey.

96
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:15,978
Late night, Grey?

97
00:04:16,685 --> 00:04:19,179
No, caffeine just hasn't kicked in yet.

98
00:04:19,204 --> 00:04:22,421
If you were at all religious, you would want to start praying it kicks in soon.

99
00:04:22,497 --> 00:04:24,022
There's  a consult in the pit.

100
00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:25,947
Girl with a fever and abdominal pain.

101
00:04:26,102 --> 00:04:29,028
After that, nicholas in 3311 needs his meds.

102
00:04:29,153 --> 00:04:32,014
Mr. Moeller's I.V. fell out, and he's a hard stick.

103
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:36,797
Post-ops in 1337, 3342, 3363, and 2381.

104
00:04:36,957 --> 00:04:38,395
...381.

105
00:04:39,205 --> 00:04:43,001
3342, 3363,

106
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:45,926
and 23...

107
00:04:46,448 --> 00:04:48,306
Why are you still standing in front of me?

108
00:04:50,694 --> 00:04:53,202
You look more like me than you right now. What's the matter?

109
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,001
Nothing.

110
00:04:54,113 --> 00:04:56,045
Help! I need immediate help.

111
00:04:56,131 --> 00:04:56,878
What's  the problem?

112
00:04:57,026 --> 00:04:59,331
My damn boyfriend swallowed my keys.

113
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,665
I didn't want her to leave.

114
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:05,111
Locate the lady's keys.

115
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:09,248
I think she got some bug on her trip to Mexico with her friends.

116
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:13,135
I told her not to go to a third world country, but does she ever listen?

117
00:05:13,374 --> 00:05:15,827
She's been weak ever since, and she's lost weight.

118
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:17,153
Apparently.

119
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,437
And this morning, she passed out in the shower.

120
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:22,018
When was the trip?

121
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,450
A couple weeks ago.

122
00:05:24,593 --> 00:05:26,677
I'm really fine. I just have a fever.

123
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:30,543
Okay, well, will you lie back for an exam for me?

124
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:33,844
No, please, I don't need an exam.

125
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,152
Just give me some antibiotics, send me home.

126
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,785
Well, maybe it is just a fever,

127
00:05:39,013 --> 00:05:42,722
but they called down for a surgeon, so I have to give the okay to let you go.

128
00:05:43,193 --> 00:05:46,030
So just let me do the exam.

129
00:05:49,026 --> 00:05:49,815
Do the exam.

130
00:05:50,368 --> 00:05:51,023
No.

131
00:05:53,034 --> 00:05:55,042
This is crazy. I'm fine.

132
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,512
For god's sake, Claire, I don't want to spend my entire day here.

133
00:06:00,275 --> 00:06:05,379
You know, actually, Mrs. Rice, this might be easier if we had some privacy,

134
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:08,159
so would you two mind leaving the room?

135
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,408
That's fine.

136
00:06:14,032 --> 00:06:16,345
Digby -- Digby Owens. I have an appointment.

137
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:21,246
Excuse me, sir -- uh, you're bleeding.

138
00:06:21,331 --> 00:06:22,106
You mind if I --

139
00:06:22,234 --> 00:06:24,083
Sure, sure. Have a look.

140
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,042
- That's a gunshot.
- Yeah.

141
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:29,341
We got a gunshot wound. We got to get him down to the pit.

142
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:31,957
Sit. Mr., Uh --

143
00:06:32,116 --> 00:06:36,340
Digby. All right, but it isn't an emergency. I scheduled it.

144
00:06:36,421 --> 00:06:38,691
- What, the gunshot?
- Yeah. My buddy shot me.

145
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,562
- Buddy?
- Yeah, just as a favor.

146
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:41,880
- On purpose?
- Hell, yeah.

147
00:06:41,952 --> 00:06:44,052
He wasn't trying to hurt me or nothing, but you know...

148
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:44,931
But why?

149
00:06:45,227 --> 00:06:46,580
I like the scars.

150
00:06:48,371 --> 00:06:50,762
Look, everyone in town has tats, but my art is about commitment.

151
00:06:50,886 --> 00:06:52,714
So, this your art, huh?

152
00:06:52,822 --> 00:06:53,876
Damn straight.

153
00:06:54,126 --> 00:06:56,886
Damn stupid. The bullet went all the way through.

154
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,588
Bounced off my ribs.

155
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:00,843
I have another one still in my shoulder.

156
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,494
Nice, huh?

157
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:05,268
You could hang it in the Louvre.

158
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:07,034
I have an ethos.

159
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:11,396
Why do anything unless you're willing to go one step further than anybody else?

160
00:07:11,484 --> 00:07:13,286
What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.

161
00:07:13,352 --> 00:07:14,387
Exactly.

162
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,184
And pain is the great divide.

163
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:19,462
My coach used to say, it's all about how we process pain.

164
00:07:19,604 --> 00:07:20,362
Football?

165
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:21,969
Wrestling, Iowa state.

166
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:23,864
Iowa? 141.

167
00:07:23,961 --> 00:07:25,395
157.

168
00:07:25,472 --> 00:07:27,017
You got to be more than 180 now.

169
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:29,557
I'd like to see you get back under 145.

170
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:33,315
Excuse me, but thinking of you men in tights makes me want to...

171
00:07:34,052 --> 00:07:34,846
puke.

172
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:37,478
There's a flu going around the hospital.

173
00:07:37,816 --> 00:07:39,045
Somewhat ironic.

174
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:42,788
Ow.

175
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,112
Don't push so hard.

176
00:07:48,338 --> 00:07:51,718
Can you lift your shirt so I can examine your stomach?

177
00:08:13,698 --> 00:08:15,081
Where did you get these?

178
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,615
Claire... you've had surgery recently.

179
00:08:23,964 --> 00:08:25,623
These scars are still pink.

180
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:27,844
Don't tell my parents.

181
00:08:29,103 --> 00:08:31,629
You did this in Mexico so your parents wouldn't know?

182
00:08:34,336 --> 00:08:35,510
What did you have done?

183
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:45,201
And you noticed her foot twitching?

184
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:46,021
Come on, Jamie.

185
00:08:46,323 --> 00:08:48,233
- My foot.
- Oh, yeah.

186
00:08:48,385 --> 00:08:49,502
About three months ago?

187
00:08:49,584 --> 00:08:50,485
Just a little.

188
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:54,998
We took her to county hospital, and she got the C.T. scan, which showed her --

189
00:08:55,062 --> 00:08:57,419
Brain abnormality. Here, you can put it.

190
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,251
And the twitching has gotten worse?

191
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:03,362
A lot worse. They don't have the proper equipment back home to figure out what's wrong.

192
00:09:03,818 --> 00:09:06,720
You did a -- you did a good thing.

193
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:09,157
- Yes, your mommy.
- Show mommy and daddy.

194
00:09:09,235 --> 00:09:13,459
Okay. You did a good thing by coming all this way, Mr. and Mrs. Hayes.

195
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:15,200
You sit tight, Jamie, okay?

196
00:09:15,446 --> 00:09:17,550
I'm going to bring in Dr. Shepherd to see you.

197
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:19,778
Okay? Dr. Shepherd.

198
00:09:20,663 --> 00:09:22,275
He's  the brain specialist.

199
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:24,134
My mommy and daddy.

200
00:09:24,221 --> 00:09:27,518
Doctor? Is he good, this Dr. Shepherd?

201
00:09:28,773 --> 00:09:30,093
At just about everything.

202
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:37,201
I  assume the lady needs her keys to leave this guy's sorry ass behind.

203
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:38,117
Yeah.

204
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:39,433
Well, help her out.

205
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,502
He needs a bronchoscopy.

206
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:43,166
See one, do one, teach one.

207
00:09:43,242 --> 00:09:44,952
You've seen one. It's time to do one.

208
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,002
Alone?

209
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,333
Seriously?

210
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:50,277
Thanks. I mean, the vote of confidence in my skills and all --

211
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,464
I didn't think anyone was noticing how hard --

212
00:09:52,546 --> 00:09:53,974
- Izzie? Go.
- Yeah.

213
00:09:54,508 --> 00:09:56,006
- You paged?
- Where are we?

214
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:59,273
I did the consult, did the I.V., the meds, the post-ops, everything.

215
00:09:59,344 --> 00:10:00,175
How is your pit patient?

216
00:10:00,261 --> 00:10:02,652
She's febrile and has peritoneal signs.

217
00:10:02,786 --> 00:10:03,932
You all right, Dr. Yang?

218
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:04,659
Fine.

219
00:10:05,851 --> 00:10:07,014
On my way back to clinic.

220
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:10,542
I  think she had some sort of illegal surgery done in Mexico.

221
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:11,560
Botched abortion?

222
00:10:11,648 --> 00:10:14,296
No, she has four laparoscopic scars on her abdomen

223
00:10:14,468 --> 00:10:16,824
and won't say what they're from. The parents are clueless.

224
00:10:16,885 --> 00:10:19,383
- Oh, she's a minor.
- 17. Freshman in college.

225
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,202
- You order up for a C.T.?
- Yes.

226
00:10:21,392 --> 00:10:24,827
So, while she's there, the nurses couldn't get a foley on Mr. Gry.

227
00:10:24,898 --> 00:10:27,321
He may need a coudé cath if you can't get a normal one in there.

228
00:10:27,402 --> 00:10:32,215
Write up post-op notes on all surgical-floor patients that had surgery within the last 24 hours.

229
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,481
Be sure to document their EKGs and x-rays.

230
00:10:35,563 --> 00:10:37,182
Hunt them down if you can't find them.

231
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,084
Right away.

232
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,601
Hey.

233
00:10:43,173 --> 00:10:43,806
Whoa.

234
00:10:44,404 --> 00:10:45,170
Got the flu?

235
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:46,496
Yeah, and thanks for it.

236
00:10:46,577 --> 00:10:47,908
It's making my life so much easier.

237
00:10:48,258 --> 00:10:50,591
I didn't give it to you. It's all over the hospital.

238
00:10:51,344 --> 00:10:52,393
You should be in bed.

239
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,906
Disease, diagnosis, and prescription from one man.

240
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:58,251
Seriously, I'll give you a ride home.

241
00:10:58,507 --> 00:11:00,309
This is not gonna make me go home.

242
00:11:00,663 --> 00:11:01,512
You go home.

243
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,674
But I feel fine.

244
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,319
Hey, hey, hey -- have you seen Shepherd?

245
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,040
Not as up close as Meredith has.

246
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:17,419
What? Are you trying to get her in trouble? She's our friend.

247
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:20,924
George, this program will make or break our careers, okay?

248
00:11:20,989 --> 00:11:22,909
Some of us will make it through, and some of us won't.

249
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:27,440
And that decision depends entirely on recommendations from doctors like Shepherd.

250
00:11:27,757 --> 00:11:29,458
There is a reason we don't sleep with the attendings.

251
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:30,943
It's not her fault, it's Shepherd's.

252
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:32,682
He's the attending. He should know better.

253
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,927
He's taking advantage of her.

254
00:11:34,008 --> 00:11:37,179
It didn't exactly sound like anything was happening against her will last night.

255
00:11:41,797 --> 00:11:44,460
Okay, we're in good shape here.

256
00:11:44,562 --> 00:11:45,868
I think so, Dr. Shepherd.

257
00:11:46,104 --> 00:11:47,082
Looks good.

258
00:11:56,451 --> 00:11:57,341
Here you go, doc.

259
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:59,411
The kid's C.T.s just arrived from Kennedy.

260
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:00,563
- Thanks.
- Excuse me.

261
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,739
Sorry, Dr. Taylor.

262
00:12:03,721 --> 00:12:04,781
That would be bourbon.

263
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:06,081
What?

264
00:12:06,316 --> 00:12:07,378
I smelled it, too.

265
00:12:08,554 --> 00:12:11,192
And he's the best anesthesiologist on the staff.

266
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:14,115
I'll worry when he's too juiced to do his crossword puzzle.

267
00:12:22,254 --> 00:12:23,367
Will you close up for me?

268
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:24,785
Thank you, everyone.

269
00:12:27,826 --> 00:12:29,776
- Dr. Shepherd...
- I got to get some coffee.

270
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,535
Jamie Hayes has been admitted -- the little girl with the brain abnormality.

271
00:12:33,603 --> 00:12:34,466
How's she presenting?

272
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:38,246
She has what looks like continuous seizure activity in her left foot.

273
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:41,943
Her balance is off. Her parents have come a long way to try to find out what's wrong.

274
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:42,881
How old are these?

275
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:44,036
Three months old.

276
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,500
I need new ones. Her brain could look dramatically different today.

277
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:50,036
Okay, I'll order them...

278
00:12:50,872 --> 00:12:51,686
Thank you.

279
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:54,072
Doc.

280
00:12:56,836 --> 00:13:00,308
And that -- that's a bullet from a previous gunshot.

281
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:01,972
Previous gunshot? Okay.

282
00:13:02,104 --> 00:13:03,283
No reason to take it out.

283
00:13:03,369 --> 00:13:04,598
No, the guy likes pain.

284
00:13:04,768 --> 00:13:05,791
It's his ethos.

285
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:07,200
Pain as an ethos?

286
00:13:07,814 --> 00:13:09,856
Wait, I think I know this guy.

287
00:13:12,109 --> 00:13:13,574
You remember this guy?

288
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,125
Hey, the tattooed masochist.

289
00:13:16,364 --> 00:13:17,598
Had himself shot again.

290
00:13:17,794 --> 00:13:19,508
Glad to see he's still stupid.

291
00:13:19,626 --> 00:13:20,501
It's his ethos.

292
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,545
Let's go tell him what he gets to do today.

293
00:13:22,713 --> 00:13:23,650
Dr. Bailey?

294
00:13:23,931 --> 00:13:26,277
Claire rice's abdominal C.T.s.

295
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:28,115
Is this girl fat?

296
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:30,353
Not at all. She's a normal college kid.

297
00:13:30,736 --> 00:13:32,133
So what do you see?

298
00:13:32,924 --> 00:13:34,475
Her stomach's stapled.

299
00:13:34,812 --> 00:13:36,491
She's had a gastric bypass.

300
00:13:36,558 --> 00:13:38,085
And a bad one, at that.

301
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:43,342
Gastric bypass is a procedure normally done on obese patients

302
00:13:43,552 --> 00:13:44,970
to help them lose weight.

303
00:13:45,775 --> 00:13:46,644
Claire?

304
00:13:47,378 --> 00:13:48,635
She doesn't need to lose weight.

305
00:13:48,717 --> 00:13:49,636
Are you kidding?

306
00:13:50,018 --> 00:13:51,795
This means the world to her.

307
00:13:52,256 --> 00:13:55,061
But it is so typical of this girl to take the easy way out.

308
00:13:55,108 --> 00:13:57,535
She's done it with everything since she was a little kid.

309
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:00,233
Mrs. Rice, nothing about this is gonna be easy.

310
00:14:00,325 --> 00:14:02,598
She's gonna face a lifelong struggle with malnutrition

311
00:14:02,665 --> 00:14:05,210
unless she has surgery to reverse the procedure.

312
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,296
Do the surgery.

313
00:14:07,426 --> 00:14:09,905
I told her to watch the freshman 15 --

314
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:11,840
don't eat junk, exercise.

315
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,463
But when she came home Christmas, who had to take her out and buy her

316
00:14:14,523 --> 00:14:18,199
a brand-new pair of size-6 jeans because she couldn't get in the ones I got her last summer?

317
00:14:18,742 --> 00:14:21,272
Tina, you know, she tries so hard.

318
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,794
She does. She gets good grades. She gets "A"s.

319
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,507
She has illegal surgery in Mexico.

320
00:14:28,154 --> 00:14:32,161
Unfortunately, there were complications with the bypass.

321
00:14:33,134 --> 00:14:34,015
What do you mean?

322
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:37,999
She has what looks like an abscess under her diaphragm --

323
00:14:38,081 --> 00:14:40,953
an edema, which is a swelling of the bowel wall.

324
00:14:41,055 --> 00:14:43,359
I can't say for certain she'll recover completely.

325
00:14:45,728 --> 00:14:49,391
Just... do whatever you have to do to make her well, okay?

326
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,763
You look like a princess.

327
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:54,890
Do you know you're a princess?

328
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:57,347
It's not lipstick.

329
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,384
It's not lipstick? No, it's not lipstick.

330
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:00,702
Want to do my shoulder?

331
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:02,799
- Oh, good. 
- And nose?

332
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:05,053
Now, we're gonna find out what's causing these seizures.

333
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,260
Does MRI know we're coming down?

334
00:15:07,346 --> 00:15:08,509
You said C.T.

335
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,685
Now I'm saying MRI.

336
00:15:11,548 --> 00:15:12,628
It's available.

337
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:14,049
Good.

338
00:15:14,172 --> 00:15:15,795
Doctor, is she gonna need surgery?

339
00:15:16,102 --> 00:15:16,926
I don't know yet.

340
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:18,593
Well, it's just that my wife and I, we both work.

341
00:15:18,683 --> 00:15:21,237
- And I don't know if our insurance -- 
- We know it can be very expensive.

342
00:15:21,315 --> 00:15:22,661
I don't want you to worry about that.

343
00:15:25,544 --> 00:15:28,436
It's a focal, left-size seizure. Let's get that diazepam running right now, please.

344
00:15:28,903 --> 00:15:30,591
- A tourniquet, please.
- Tourniquet.

345
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:32,333
Hey, Jamie, here's what we're gonna do.

346
00:15:32,685 --> 00:15:34,423
We're gonna put this on your arm, okay?

347
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:35,732
Isn't that fun?

348
00:15:35,952 --> 00:15:37,325
Here, we're gonna put that onto you, like that.

349
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:39,256
And this is gonna feel cold.

350
00:15:39,624 --> 00:15:40,719
This is a butterfly.

351
00:15:41,918 --> 00:15:43,216
Butterfly lands right there.

352
00:15:44,006 --> 00:15:46,300
Mmm, there we go. Blanket for the butterfly -- good. Nicely done.

353
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:51,364
It's amazing stuff, isn't it?

354
00:15:54,017 --> 00:15:56,130
- Hey, you like spaceships?
- Yeah.

355
00:15:56,208 --> 00:16:00,140
You do? Okay, should we take captain O'malley, my first lieutenant,

356
00:16:00,212 --> 00:16:02,116
to the spaceship MRI?

357
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:03,131
Let's go.

358
00:16:04,306 --> 00:16:07,938
It'll be safer to wait until your lunch digests before we do the procedure.

359
00:16:08,378 --> 00:16:11,388
Perfect -- this is just perfect.

360
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:13,196
I was hoping to be in portland right now.

361
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:16,626
You're gonna be under conscious sedation, which means you'll be awake, but groggy.

362
00:16:16,777 --> 00:16:19,155
Wait, wait. Is this gonna hurt?

363
00:16:19,498 --> 00:16:21,875
We'll give you something for pain.

364
00:16:21,993 --> 00:16:23,662
Do you know how stupid you make me look?

365
00:16:24,143 --> 00:16:25,960
I thought you would think this is funny.

366
00:16:26,093 --> 00:16:26,887
Funny?

367
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:28,479
Romantic?

368
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,838
Like the therapist thing was funny and romantic?

369
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,631
- That was funny.
- No, that was sad.

370
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:36,078
He called my therapist, pretending to be his therapist,

371
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:37,609
to find out what I'd said about him.

372
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:39,174
A little passive-aggressive, isn't it, J.P.?

373
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:41,387
He is the king of passive-aggressive.

374
00:16:41,628 --> 00:16:42,846
And he's manipulative...

375
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,295
And needy.

376
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,537
Well, that's the trifecta.

377
00:16:46,644 --> 00:16:47,715
What do I win?

378
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:52,062
What?

379
00:16:53,998 --> 00:16:54,837
Doc!

380
00:16:57,122 --> 00:16:59,235
I  prefer we stop meeting like this, Mr. Owens.

381
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:00,377
Digby.

382
00:17:01,106 --> 00:17:02,635
So, how's the trumpet playing?

383
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,072
Very safe, compared to your hobby.

384
00:17:06,581 --> 00:17:08,559
Getting shot is a little more risky.

385
00:17:08,647 --> 00:17:09,826
That's kind of the point.

386
00:17:10,453 --> 00:17:11,528
He's running a fever.

387
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,792
Due to the extra stress on his body from the gunshot.

388
00:17:14,185 --> 00:17:14,881
Digby...

389
00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:18,845
the impact of the bullet on your chest

390
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:21,708
fractured a rib and caused a hemopneumothorax.

391
00:17:21,979 --> 00:17:23,208
That sucks, I guess.

392
00:17:23,284 --> 00:17:24,507
There's blood in your collapsed lung.

393
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,749
The price of body art went up since your last gunshot.

394
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,577
Ah, no pain, no gain, right?

395
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:30,887
That's one way to look at it.

396
00:17:31,163 --> 00:17:33,207
We have that in common, you docs and me.

397
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:34,056
Do we?

398
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:37,262
Yeah, the way you guys push, push, push.

399
00:17:37,548 --> 00:17:38,922
When I was wrestling,

400
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,661
if you wanted to pin me, you was gonna have to kill me.

401
00:17:42,172 --> 00:17:44,612
- Iowa style.
- Iowa state style.

402
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:47,220
Back home, we were sworn enemies.

403
00:17:47,415 --> 00:17:50,121
But in seattle, man, we're brothers.

404
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:57,036
So, what are we gonna do about this, um... hemopneumo-durasis?

405
00:17:57,137 --> 00:18:00,374
We're gonna insert a chest tube to drain the blood, then reinflate your lung.

406
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:02,969
Oh, please...

407
00:18:03,738 --> 00:18:05,259
tell me I get to watch.

408
00:18:11,198 --> 00:18:13,749
Oh, man -- Iowa style.

409
00:18:16,431 --> 00:18:18,637
Before you guys start, I know you're mad.

410
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,827
Disbelief, Claire -- just... disbelief.

411
00:18:22,006 --> 00:18:23,296
I'm just concerned.

412
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,004
Where did you get the idea to do this?

413
00:18:26,153 --> 00:18:26,993
The internet.

414
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:31,248
Honey, there is a healthy way to lose weight.

415
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,683
Yeah, I tried that, but...

416
00:18:36,457 --> 00:18:38,893
it doesn't work for me like it does for you.

417
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:42,348
Hey, you don't need to lose weight.

418
00:18:42,574 --> 00:18:43,741
What are you eating?

419
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,963
And how much have you been working out?

420
00:18:46,086 --> 00:18:50,361
Most of the time, when people hit their target weight, they have to work to stay there.

421
00:18:50,484 --> 00:18:53,556
Everyone gains weight in college, mom.

422
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:56,981
It's... stressful.

423
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,178
There's -- there's not enough time for exercise.

424
00:19:04,072 --> 00:19:07,472
I just thought if I wasn't worried about my diet, then...

425
00:19:08,092 --> 00:19:11,021
I could focus more on my studies.

426
00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:12,991
So you took yet another shortcut?

427
00:19:13,617 --> 00:19:15,474
Life doesn't work that way, Claire.

428
00:19:15,562 --> 00:19:16,289
Tina!

429
00:19:16,437 --> 00:19:18,281
What? You want to argue this?

430
00:19:19,898 --> 00:19:22,700
She has so much potential. If she would just apply herself...

431
00:19:22,782 --> 00:19:28,009
Okay, I think we should focus on taking care of your daughter.

432
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:30,984
And, Claire, your parents agree --

433
00:19:31,123 --> 00:19:34,368
the best thing to do is to reverse the bypass.

434
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:35,291
No!

435
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,034
No, it's my body.

436
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,367
I do not want surgery again. Please?

437
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:43,830
There are serious complications.

438
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:45,985
And this is about your health.

439
00:19:46,293 --> 00:19:47,773
But I'd rather be thin.

440
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,322
Well, I'm afraid the choice isn't up to you.

441
00:20:03,982 --> 00:20:06,041
It's called rasmussin's encephalitis.

442
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:09,302
What it amounts to is that this side of her brain --

443
00:20:09,517 --> 00:20:11,458
this part's all healthy, it's working perfectly.

444
00:20:11,606 --> 00:20:15,261
This black part of the brain, this -- all of that is dead, or dying.

445
00:20:15,738 --> 00:20:19,660
The condition has gotten radically worse since her C.T. scans three months ago.

446
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:22,757
Left untreated, the disease is gonna kill her.

447
00:20:24,243 --> 00:20:25,102
How soon?

448
00:20:25,804 --> 00:20:26,633
Too soon.

449
00:20:28,004 --> 00:20:29,843
So, is there a cure?

450
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:34,370
The treatment requires the diseased portion of her brain be removed and sealed off.

451
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:38,138
See, eventually, the spinal fluid will fill the cavity.

452
00:20:38,543 --> 00:20:40,892
Remove? But, I mean, that's --

453
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:42,510
Half her brain, yes.

454
00:20:49,136 --> 00:20:52,980
Half her brain -- that... seems impossible.

455
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,711
Her age makes it possible.

456
00:20:55,306 --> 00:20:56,786
Her brain's not fully developed,

457
00:20:56,857 --> 00:21:00,072
so the remaining neurons will compensate for the loss.

458
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:02,299
But will she be normal?

459
00:21:02,515 --> 00:21:06,124
There are risks to any surgery, and this is, you know, a major one.

460
00:21:06,222 --> 00:21:08,090
But if, you know, we're successful,

461
00:21:08,203 --> 00:21:11,945
Jamie could walk out of this hospital in a couple weeks, go on to live a relatively normal life.

462
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:13,768
Look, I know this is a lot to digest.

463
00:21:13,866 --> 00:21:16,128
The important thing to remember is that we can save her life.

464
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:16,990
Thank you.

465
00:21:17,301 --> 00:21:18,258
Dr. O'malley?

466
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:19,533
Yes? What?

467
00:21:19,984 --> 00:21:20,989
I'm sorry to bother you.

468
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,286
But if the parents consent, I thought you'd like to scrub in on the hemispherectomy.

469
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,139
Are you in, or not?

470
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:27,398
Uh, in.

471
00:21:28,483 --> 00:21:29,236
Good.

472
00:21:37,418 --> 00:21:38,170
Yang.

473
00:21:38,657 --> 00:21:41,668
I'm scrubbing in on a hemispherectomy with Shepherd.

474
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:43,710
Get out! I would kill for that.

475
00:21:43,796 --> 00:21:47,171
We're gonna cut out half a girl's brain and it's going to work.

476
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:48,779
It's outrageous.

477
00:21:49,677 --> 00:21:51,549
Almost makes it hard to hate him.

478
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:53,029
Why do you hate him?

479
00:21:53,121 --> 00:21:53,951
Oh, no reason.

480
00:21:54,832 --> 00:21:56,200
You know about him and Meredith?

481
00:21:57,099 --> 00:21:57,964
You know?

482
00:21:58,603 --> 00:22:00,571
When are you gonna figure out that I know everything?

483
00:22:00,658 --> 00:22:01,436
She knows.

484
00:22:01,831 --> 00:22:03,095
What, about doctor-cest?

485
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,549
It's been going on for, like, ever.

486
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,310
And you didn't tell us?

487
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:07,589
Ooh, you're a gossip, huh?

488
00:22:07,668 --> 00:22:09,123
- I am not!
- I am.

489
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:12,439
He's about to go into major brain surgery on no sleep?

490
00:22:12,685 --> 00:22:13,986
Not very responsible.

491
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:15,168
Jealous much?

492
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,940
Sex all night isn't about being responsible.

493
00:22:17,027 --> 00:22:18,547
No, it's about sex all night.

494
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,985
I can't believe you're not more pissed off about this.

495
00:22:21,043 --> 00:22:23,447
Well, she works hard all day. She's got a hard job.

496
00:22:23,513 --> 00:22:25,265
Why should you care how she unwinds?

497
00:22:25,373 --> 00:22:27,785
I mean, you like to bake all night. Some people like to drink.

498
00:22:27,851 --> 00:22:29,659
Others like an occasional screaming orgasm.

499
00:22:29,734 --> 00:22:30,507
Yeah, we do.

500
00:22:32,504 --> 00:22:33,861
Forget I said that.

501
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:35,254
Pretend like I'm not here.

502
00:22:35,874 --> 00:22:36,677
Continue.

503
00:22:38,311 --> 00:22:39,944
You look like you need to be spoon-fed.

504
00:22:41,101 --> 00:22:42,289
You look like Alex.

505
00:22:42,648 --> 00:22:46,191
Yeah, about drinking -- Dr. Taylor, the anesthesiologist --

506
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:48,156
do you think he drinks?

507
00:22:48,315 --> 00:22:49,867
Whatever gets you through the day.

508
00:22:49,939 --> 00:22:52,856
I mean here, at work. Earlier, I thought I smelled --

509
00:22:53,635 --> 00:22:57,199
Do you think -- I mean, his patients trust that --

510
00:22:58,832 --> 00:23:01,116
So I should say something, right?

511
00:23:01,427 --> 00:23:02,770
It's a can of worms, George.

512
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:05,969
Weren't we talking about sex, anyway?

513
00:23:07,201 --> 00:23:08,576
- Doofus.
- Ew.

514
00:23:12,498 --> 00:23:15,333
This is gonna leave a pretty sexy scar, huh?

515
00:23:15,621 --> 00:23:17,550
Don't get any more crazy ideas.

516
00:23:18,252 --> 00:23:20,172
You really think my ideas are crazy?

517
00:23:20,503 --> 00:23:21,841
I'm leaning that way.

518
00:23:22,102 --> 00:23:23,925
We wrestle, he plays trumpet.

519
00:23:25,261 --> 00:23:26,792
Hey, I feel pretty dizzy.

520
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,600
You've lost some blood.

521
00:23:30,053 --> 00:23:31,887
This, too, shall pass.

522
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,679
Hey...

523
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,570
how come I don't see you down at the mat in belltown?

524
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:38,999
Oh, man, no time.

525
00:23:39,147 --> 00:23:40,510
Bro, make time.

526
00:23:41,472 --> 00:23:43,101
I'll be expecting you.

527
00:23:43,827 --> 00:23:44,696
I'm there.

528
00:23:49,908 --> 00:23:51,169
Handle with care.

529
00:23:51,245 --> 00:23:53,637
This thing's full of gunk. I know.

530
00:23:53,862 --> 00:23:58,164
We need to free the bowel from the adhesions caused from the abscess.

531
00:23:58,685 --> 00:23:59,817
This poor girl...

532
00:24:01,282 --> 00:24:02,464
What was she thinking?

533
00:24:02,581 --> 00:24:04,231
She wants her mother's approval.

534
00:24:04,446 --> 00:24:05,879
She wanted to please her.

535
00:24:05,981 --> 00:24:07,486
And this damage is the result?

536
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:10,032
Here, resect that.

537
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,767
Needle-tip over here, please.

538
00:24:12,466 --> 00:24:15,392
When you're done here, you have post-ops waiting.

539
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,183
I know, Dr. Bailey.

540
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:20,159
Cristina's got the flu, so you need to pick up the slack in the clinic.

541
00:24:20,255 --> 00:24:22,566
Look, I'll mop the floors, okay?

542
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,780
Sorry, that was inappropriate.

543
00:24:25,873 --> 00:24:27,869
It's not the only thing that's inappropriate.

544
00:24:30,865 --> 00:24:33,614
You care to tell me what you think you're doing?

545
00:24:33,687 --> 00:24:35,887
I'll jump through hoops if you want me to.

546
00:24:35,985 --> 00:24:38,740
But what I do what I leave this hospital is my business.

547
00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:40,837
Half this hospital knows your business.

548
00:24:40,925 --> 00:24:43,482
Flu isn't the only virus spreading around here.

549
00:24:43,721 --> 00:24:47,387
I made a choice, and I know you don't respect me for that choice.

550
00:24:47,556 --> 00:24:49,712
But I'll live with the consequences.

551
00:24:49,783 --> 00:24:52,266
Then I'll have lots of hoops for you to jump through.

552
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:54,181
I've done everything you've asked me to do.

553
00:24:54,263 --> 00:24:56,738
I may not do it your way, but it gets done.

554
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,424
So whatever else you got, bring it on.

555
00:25:04,685 --> 00:25:08,846
Okay, Dr. Grey, now that you've drained the organ,

556
00:25:09,037 --> 00:25:10,731
we can attempt to repair it.

557
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:13,490
Now my day is perfect.

558
00:25:18,866 --> 00:25:19,957
I appreciate this.

559
00:25:20,703 --> 00:25:23,684
The chance to scrub in on this kind of procedure is, well --

560
00:25:24,636 --> 00:25:25,961
yeah, I appreciate it.

561
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:29,634
Here you go. Triple espresso, not too hot.

562
00:25:29,705 --> 00:25:31,077
Oh, I love you, seriously.

563
00:25:31,553 --> 00:25:34,892
Ah, coffee -- where would medicine be without it, huh?

564
00:25:34,963 --> 00:25:37,052
I hope you have a new crossword, Taylor.

565
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:38,382
We're gonna be here awhile.

566
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:39,642
Never go without.

567
00:25:39,964 --> 00:25:41,948
Big day for you, kid -- congrats.

568
00:25:42,001 --> 00:25:42,838
Thanks.

569
00:25:43,257 --> 00:25:44,220
Hey, princess.

570
00:25:44,696 --> 00:25:46,033
You ready to take a nap?

571
00:25:46,122 --> 00:25:48,296
Hey, look what I got. Blow bubbles -- that's it.

572
00:25:48,378 --> 00:25:50,354
You just breathe in. Oh, that's it.

573
00:25:50,846 --> 00:25:51,464
What?

574
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:53,845
- Do you smell... 
- Smell what?

575
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:54,915
I have a mask.

576
00:26:00,811 --> 00:26:04,312
I'm sorry, Dr. Taylor, but did you just...

577
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:07,286
Have you been drinking?

578
00:26:08,842 --> 00:26:09,949
I beg your pardon?

579
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:11,290
What?

580
00:26:11,464 --> 00:26:14,623
Do you smell -- I-I smell alcohol.

581
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,357
Where the hell do you get off accusing me of something like that?

582
00:26:19,318 --> 00:26:20,911
George, you're out of line.

583
00:26:21,223 --> 00:26:22,355
There are rules.

584
00:26:22,774 --> 00:26:24,701
You know, there are rules for a reason. You ju--

585
00:26:28,351 --> 00:26:30,509
There is a 2-year-old girl on this table.

586
00:26:32,097 --> 00:26:34,964
You shouldn't take advantage of someone else's vulnerability.

587
00:26:35,057 --> 00:26:37,956
I don't need some punk intern telling me what's at stake here.

588
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:39,896
Get him out of here, Shep.

589
00:26:43,085 --> 00:26:43,842
Shep?

590
00:26:45,758 --> 00:26:46,807
You're out, George.

591
00:26:56,311 --> 00:26:57,985
You damned well better be ready, Taylor.

592
00:26:58,078 --> 00:26:59,842
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

593
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:07,549
Do you really, seriously want to know why I'm leaving?! Seriously?

594
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,396
How about when you started insisting that I quit my job,

595
00:27:10,457 --> 00:27:12,213
right when I started to make more money than you?

596
00:27:12,259 --> 00:27:14,466
That should have been the last straw.

597
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:18,194
No, the last straw should have been when I found out that those mysterious phone calls

598
00:27:18,245 --> 00:27:20,886
that you've been getting that you kept denying were from other women --

599
00:27:20,943 --> 00:27:22,914
were really coming from your mother!

600
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:24,511
This isn't healthy.

601
00:27:24,593 --> 00:27:27,153
- Just hold still, please.
- Don't you dare try to patch this up!

602
00:27:27,214 --> 00:27:28,854
Okay, could the both of you just please stop?

603
00:27:28,915 --> 00:27:31,910
You don't love me, J.P. You love to smother me.

604
00:27:31,966 --> 00:27:34,118
And if I could get you to just admit that,

605
00:27:34,184 --> 00:27:36,826
then I could leave you with an ounce of respect.

606
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:39,141
Athena, I let you stay in here to keep him calm.

607
00:27:39,206 --> 00:27:40,891
- So if you're just gonna keep arguing -- 
- Check that --

608
00:27:40,962 --> 00:27:45,151
I can't respect a man desperate enough to swallow my exit strategy.

609
00:27:45,217 --> 00:27:47,093
That is the last straw!

610
00:27:47,153 --> 00:27:48,951
Michelle, can you get her out of here?

611
00:27:49,404 --> 00:27:50,235
Ma'am?

612
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:51,796
Fine!

613
00:27:53,862 --> 00:27:55,058
- Come on.
- What?

614
00:27:57,194 --> 00:27:58,065
What's happening?

615
00:27:58,622 --> 00:27:59,958
The keys moved farther down.

616
00:28:00,127 --> 00:28:01,339
Oh, my god, what does that mean?

617
00:28:02,027 --> 00:28:05,042
What did you do? Don't you dare die, J.P.!

618
00:28:05,114 --> 00:28:07,105
Please! Please, just shut up!

619
00:28:07,193 --> 00:28:09,414
Breathe, J.P. Just breathe.

620
00:28:12,425 --> 00:28:13,235
Got it.

621
00:28:20,895 --> 00:28:22,436
Very impressive, J.P.

622
00:28:23,778 --> 00:28:25,790
Is he okay? Is he gonna be okay?

623
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:27,415
Yeah, he'll be fine.

624
00:28:33,971 --> 00:28:37,658
You lit-- you did that on purpose, didn't you?

625
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,029
Can I offer you some advice?

626
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:43,372
Get in your car and go,

627
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:44,918
for all of our sakes.

628
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,835
You'll never know where I parked it.

629
00:28:54,748 --> 00:28:57,093
- I need a shower.
- I need a shower.

630
00:28:57,175 --> 00:29:00,579
You need to go tell that girl's parents what kind of kid they're getting back.

631
00:29:00,653 --> 00:29:02,326
You're not gonna let me shower first?

632
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:04,576
That would be a hoop, would it not?

633
00:29:04,984 --> 00:29:06,417
It would qualify.

634
00:29:07,294 --> 00:29:08,885
Shower first, then.

635
00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:14,045
Ew, what smells?

636
00:29:14,204 --> 00:29:18,480
That would be me -- or more specifically, my patient's insides all over me.

637
00:29:19,448 --> 00:29:21,126
That makes me strangely happy.

638
00:29:21,445 --> 00:29:25,305
Oh, god. Oh, Meredith, you smell like...

639
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,284
Karma.

640
00:29:26,523 --> 00:29:27,967
- What?
- Nothing.

641
00:29:28,071 --> 00:29:29,944
Something vile's stuck in your hair.

642
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,955
You know, just go stand over there, please.

643
00:29:36,011 --> 00:29:39,692
Ugh, how much do I love being a surgeon right now?

644
00:29:40,168 --> 00:29:41,111
Karma.

645
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,931
What does karma have to do with anything?

646
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:46,876
I'm just saying, you've been given all the best surgeries.

647
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:51,484
And now you smell like putrid goo and you're giving off a stench.

648
00:29:51,571 --> 00:29:52,452
Karma's a bitch.

649
00:29:54,264 --> 00:29:56,199
Dr. Shepherd needs an intern in surgery.

650
00:29:56,265 --> 00:29:57,341
Which one of you is clear to go?

651
00:29:57,416 --> 00:29:58,585
Okay, Dr. Bailey, where do you want me?

652
00:29:58,651 --> 00:30:00,049
You need to lie down somewhere.

653
00:30:00,105 --> 00:30:01,769
I'm fine. I'm completely healthy.

654
00:30:02,174 --> 00:30:02,932
Grey?

655
00:30:03,112 --> 00:30:04,324
Of course.

656
00:30:04,735 --> 00:30:06,230
What is your problem?

657
00:30:06,316 --> 00:30:07,770
Um, you!

658
00:30:07,928 --> 00:30:12,363
'Cause apparently, you can help Dr. Mcdreamy in ways the rest of us can't.

659
00:30:13,339 --> 00:30:15,998
- You did not just s--
- Yes, I did!

660
00:30:16,126 --> 00:30:16,920
Hey!

661
00:30:17,974 --> 00:30:21,118
Hemispherectomy in O.R. one with Dr. Shepherd -- go.

662
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:32,060
Apparently...

663
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,420
I'm not the only one with hoops.

664
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:42,136
Doctor...

665
00:30:43,832 --> 00:30:47,694
Digby's post-op CBC shows a severe spike in the white blood cell count.

666
00:30:47,773 --> 00:30:48,444
What is it?

667
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:50,625
It's 27, with 16% bands.

668
00:30:50,994 --> 00:30:52,247
Something else is wrong.

669
00:30:52,432 --> 00:30:53,984
That's a little high for simple stress.

670
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:57,097
Check for any other possible sources of infection or recent illness.

671
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:03,947
We're gonna start the procedure with the left temporal lobectomy.

672
00:31:04,102 --> 00:31:05,746
Thanks for joining us, Dr. Yang.

673
00:31:06,405 --> 00:31:08,740
After the temporal, we'll do the frontal,

674
00:31:09,216 --> 00:31:10,947
and then the occipital.

675
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:26,235
We were able to reverse the gastric bypass,

676
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:28,596
but we did lose a significant portion of her bowel.

677
00:31:28,677 --> 00:31:32,571
And because of the short gut syndrome, Claire will never eat normally again.

678
00:31:33,286 --> 00:31:36,955
Okay, wait, do -- how do we help her here?

679
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,654
Well, getting proper nutrition will be a lifelong problem for Claire.

680
00:31:40,736 --> 00:31:43,591
Great -- as if we already don't have our hands full with her.

681
00:31:44,412 --> 00:31:46,259
She gets good grades.

682
00:31:46,935 --> 00:31:48,564
She stays out of trouble.

683
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,941
She's smart.

684
00:31:50,468 --> 00:31:53,694
I just think she feels like nothing she does is good enough for you.

685
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,709
If you somehow think that I'm responsible for this --

686
00:31:56,817 --> 00:31:58,907
I think Claire is killing herself...

687
00:31:59,178 --> 00:32:00,309
to please you.

688
00:32:00,775 --> 00:32:01,840
Please.

689
00:32:04,564 --> 00:32:07,333
You have no idea what's going on in that girl's mind.

690
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,644
You're her mother.

691
00:32:09,223 --> 00:32:11,440
She worships the ground you walk on.

692
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:15,126
She didn't do this for herself.

693
00:32:19,602 --> 00:32:24,281
- I think that this situation is completely ridiculous.
- Tina... shut up.

694
00:32:32,706 --> 00:32:33,543
What is it?

695
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,549
I'm freezing, doc. I-I-I can't stop shaking.

696
00:32:36,626 --> 00:32:39,119
His temp's way up and B.P.'s dropping, doctor.

697
00:32:39,196 --> 00:32:43,717
All right, Digby, have you had any recent illnesses, new piercings, tattoos, wounds?

698
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:45,328
New tat on my calf.

699
00:32:53,424 --> 00:32:55,036
Oh, my god.

700
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,398
It was nowhere near that nasty this morning.

701
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,468
But it was infected?

702
00:32:58,616 --> 00:32:59,559
Why didn't you say anything?

703
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:00,685
Ah, it was nothing.

704
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,131
I'm not here to complain about a little pain.

705
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:07,801
Well, the infection's been exacerbated by the stress on your body from the gunshot.

706
00:33:08,016 --> 00:33:09,332
Get him to ICU.

707
00:33:10,258 --> 00:33:12,168
We'll get you started on some antibiotics.

708
00:33:18,856 --> 00:33:22,306
From the frontal lobectomy, I'm going to encounter a, uh...

709
00:33:22,388 --> 00:33:24,902
We'll encounter the anterior cerebral artery.

710
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:26,853
Yes, so we're gonna need to, uh...

711
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:32,413
The branches of the artery need to be coagulated and divided.

712
00:33:32,884 --> 00:33:35,040
You know, Taylor, her anesthesia's awful light.

713
00:33:38,098 --> 00:33:39,972
Come on, Taylor, she's waking up.

714
00:33:43,668 --> 00:33:44,604
Dr. Taylor?

715
00:33:45,284 --> 00:33:46,842
Uh, he's asleep!

716
00:33:48,132 --> 00:33:48,890
Taylor!

717
00:33:57,829 --> 00:33:59,053
Dr. Taylor!

718
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:02,504
Oh, god, sorry. Sorry, I'm on it.

719
00:34:04,337 --> 00:34:05,270
My bad, Shep.

720
00:34:07,076 --> 00:34:08,101
He was right, wasn't he?

721
00:34:09,191 --> 00:34:10,697
Aw, I nodded off. Come on.

722
00:34:10,763 --> 00:34:12,401
Whatever you got to do to get through the day, right?

723
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:13,728
Steph, get me some coffee.

724
00:34:13,809 --> 00:34:14,623
Yes, doctor.

725
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:16,764
I'll be fine. It won't happen again.

726
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,054
Yeah, not in here, it won't.

727
00:34:18,341 --> 00:34:20,506
Uh, Steph, call Dr. Pennington.

728
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:22,754
Hopkins, take over until she gets here.

729
00:34:22,908 --> 00:34:24,402
Get out of here and get it together.

730
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,687
What happened?

731
00:34:32,763 --> 00:34:36,040
He went into multisymptom organ failure, secondary to overwhelming sepsis.

732
00:34:36,302 --> 00:34:37,310
Now he's all...

733
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,814
I'll fix his B.P., that should help his mental status.

734
00:34:40,132 --> 00:34:40,986
He's maxxed out...

735
00:34:42,324 --> 00:34:43,285
We got v-tach.

736
00:34:44,037 --> 00:34:45,031
He's looking bad.

737
00:34:45,308 --> 00:34:47,602
Put the defib pads on him and give him 150...

738
00:34:49,982 --> 00:34:51,118
I lost his pulse.

739
00:34:51,531 --> 00:34:53,520
Defib! Get the pads! Get the pads!

740
00:35:24,472 --> 00:35:27,901
This packing, we hope, will, uh... prevent hemorrhaging.

741
00:35:27,989 --> 00:35:29,398
Dr. Yang, do you want to add something to that?

742
00:35:29,484 --> 00:35:32,965
It will allow the cerebral spinal fluid to eventually fill the cavity.

743
00:35:33,124 --> 00:35:34,010
Very nice.

744
00:35:34,419 --> 00:35:35,602
E.T., you want to close up?

745
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:36,492
Yes, doctor.

746
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:37,792
I'm gonna go to bed.

747
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,824
That was... unreal.

748
00:35:40,911 --> 00:35:43,344
I mean, that's -- that's all there is.

749
00:35:43,451 --> 00:35:46,681
I was feeling sick until I came here.

750
00:35:46,779 --> 00:35:47,532
I was tired.

751
00:35:48,248 --> 00:35:49,379
Now I'm tired again.

752
00:35:49,841 --> 00:35:51,079
It's back to reality.

753
00:35:58,795 --> 00:36:00,178
- Let me explain.
- It's fine.

754
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,591
No, there is a code among doctors.

755
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,595
We're not supposed to ask each other questions, not within the walls of this hospital.

756
00:36:05,729 --> 00:36:07,065
Okay, I was out of line.

757
00:36:07,162 --> 00:36:08,448
No, you weren't. I was.

758
00:36:09,676 --> 00:36:10,874
I was out of line.

759
00:36:11,698 --> 00:36:13,597
Somebody should have taken responsibility,

760
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,487
and it should have been the guy doing the cutting.

761
00:36:15,537 --> 00:36:16,439
It should have been me.

762
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:19,277
You didn't deserve what happened to you today.

763
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,888
You did the right thing, code or no code.

764
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,996
You saw me leave the house this morning, didn't you?

765
00:36:34,585 --> 00:36:35,712
Oh, was that you?

766
00:36:39,223 --> 00:36:40,534
I'm not using her.

767
00:36:41,615 --> 00:36:43,334
And I don't favor her.

768
00:36:45,414 --> 00:36:47,012
She's pretty great, you know.

769
00:36:49,936 --> 00:36:53,472
So, let's go tell Jamie's parents she's gonna be fine, barring any complications.

770
00:36:57,446 --> 00:36:58,577
Did you fix me?

771
00:36:58,828 --> 00:37:00,461
No, not completely.

772
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:03,401
So... I won't get fat?

773
00:37:04,696 --> 00:37:05,495
No.

774
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,879
Oh... that's awesome.

775
00:37:09,929 --> 00:37:13,553
Claire, I've asked social services to contact your parents.

776
00:37:14,552 --> 00:37:15,627
Why?

777
00:37:15,913 --> 00:37:17,076
They can help you.

778
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:18,853
With what?

779
00:37:21,399 --> 00:37:23,031
You don't know this yet,

780
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:26,548
but life isn't supposed to be like this.

781
00:37:27,854 --> 00:37:29,846
It's not supposed to be this hard.

782
00:37:36,783 --> 00:37:38,825
Time of death, 20:49.

783
00:37:42,169 --> 00:37:44,320
The first guy I ever met out here from back home.

784
00:37:58,414 --> 00:38:00,156
I thought you'd be asleep by now.

785
00:38:00,699 --> 00:38:02,446
Yeah, well... I'm not.

786
00:38:04,751 --> 00:38:06,587
If you wait a few minutes, you can have a piece of cake.

787
00:38:06,658 --> 00:38:08,036
Baked it chock-full of love...

788
00:38:08,823 --> 00:38:14,169
Actually, chock-full of unrelenting, all-consuming rage and hostility, but it's still tasty.

789
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:16,212
- So, you know?
- I know.

790
00:38:17,835 --> 00:38:20,918
Well, do you want the long, sordid version, or the short version,

791
00:38:20,979 --> 00:38:24,133
where I started sleeping with a guy who turned out to be my boss?

792
00:38:24,215 --> 00:38:24,969
Neither.

793
00:38:25,715 --> 00:38:27,779
Izzie, cut me some slack here.

794
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:28,695
No.

795
00:38:28,878 --> 00:38:30,129
You went to Dartmouth.

796
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:31,614
Your mother is Ellis Grey.

797
00:38:31,696 --> 00:38:33,958
You grew up -- look at this house!

798
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:35,996
You know, you walk into the O.R.,

799
00:38:36,058 --> 00:38:38,434
and there isn't anyone who doubts that you should be there.

800
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:42,002
I grew up in a trailer park. I went to state school.

801
00:38:42,089 --> 00:38:44,915
I put myself through med school by posing in my underwear.

802
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:48,136
You know, I walk into the O.R., and everyone hopes I'm the nurse.

803
00:38:48,684 --> 00:38:52,642
You have their respect without even trying, and you're throwing it away for...

804
00:38:52,816 --> 00:38:54,787
what, a few good surgeries?

805
00:38:54,863 --> 00:38:55,586
No.

806
00:38:56,027 --> 00:38:57,562
It's not about the surgeries.

807
00:38:57,808 --> 00:38:59,425
It's not about getting ahead.

808
00:38:59,518 --> 00:39:00,408
Then what?

809
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:02,529
A little hot sex?

810
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,806
You're willing to ruin your credibility over that?

811
00:39:06,707 --> 00:39:09,487
I mean, Meredith, what the hell are you doing?

812
00:39:13,307 --> 00:39:14,447
Oh, my god...

813
00:39:15,672 --> 00:39:17,095
you're falling for him.

814
00:39:17,198 --> 00:39:18,800
I am not.

815
00:39:18,847 --> 00:39:20,167
Oh, you so are.

816
00:39:20,352 --> 00:39:21,858
No, I'm not.

817
00:39:22,537 --> 00:39:23,864
You so are.

818
00:39:24,782 --> 00:39:27,432
Damn it, you poor girl.

819
00:39:29,142 --> 00:39:31,109
You know, it's just that he's just so...

820
00:39:31,934 --> 00:39:34,897
and I'm just -- I'm having a hard time.

821
00:39:35,871 --> 00:39:38,593
Wow, you're all, uh, mushy and...

822
00:39:38,963 --> 00:39:39,860
warm and...

823
00:39:40,888 --> 00:39:42,219
full of secret feelings.

824
00:39:47,298 --> 00:39:48,333
I hate you!

825
00:39:49,608 --> 00:39:50,816
And your cake.

826
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,814
My cake is good.

827
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:56,657
So, um, how hot is the sex?

828
00:39:58,691 --> 00:39:59,408
Izzie...

829
00:39:59,493 --> 00:40:01,741
What? Come on, I'm not getting any.

830
00:40:02,111 --> 00:40:04,138
Help a girl out with a few details.

831
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:13,554
Maybe we like the pain.

832
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:19,980
- How's she doing?
- Good.

833
00:40:20,974 --> 00:40:21,659
Good.

834
00:40:22,356 --> 00:40:24,239
Maybe we're wired that way...

835
00:40:27,674 --> 00:40:28,442
Christina?

836
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:37,336
...because without it,

837
00:40:37,878 --> 00:40:38,673
I don't know...

838
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:45,232
...maybe we just wouldn't feel real.

839
00:40:56,104 --> 00:40:58,032
- You know, we could just...
- Sleep?

840
00:40:59,517 --> 00:41:02,092
We could, yeah, if you want to.

841
00:41:02,276 --> 00:41:03,024
Yeah?

842
00:41:07,638 --> 00:41:08,814
What's that saying?

843
00:41:09,408 --> 00:41:11,780
"Why do I keep hitting myself  with a hammer?"

844
00:41:12,209 --> 00:41:13,781
Oh, thank god.

845
00:41:15,758 --> 00:41:19,153
"Because it feels so good when I stop."
