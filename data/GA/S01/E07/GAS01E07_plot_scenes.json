Various scenes are shown or referenced: someone confesses to having feelings for their roommate but can't tell her; another person suggests just asking her out. Someone is accused of being shallow and callous, and a sarcastic offer is made to go for a drink and talk about secret pain. A character says they can't because they're seeing someone. Another warns that the woman in question is 'off the market,' but someone else disputes this, saying they would know if she was seeing someone. There is a warning about the consequences of a 'fling' and favoritism in the program, and a threat that if Meredith Grey is favored, she won't see the inside of an OR for a month. Someone asks for a definition of their relationship. These scenes summarize previous relationship drama and professional tensions among the interns and attendings.",
