The story began with a narration about the exhaustion of being an intern, emphasizing that sleepless nights were not just due to the demands of the job. In the early morning, someone was urged to get up for rounds at 5:20 AM, while another person was told to leave before others saw them. In a nearby room, two people discussed the noise from the previous night, speculating about who was involved and joking about their own jealousy. Later, a group of interns, including Meredith, George, and Izzie, gathered to discuss the previous night's events. One intern asked Meredith who the man was, but Meredith deflected, insisting it was no one they knew. The group teased Meredith about her sex life and the noise, while George complained about his lack of sleep. Meredith worried that her roommates might think she was receiving special treatment.

At the hospital, Dr. Bailey assigned George O'Malley, Cristina Yang, and Alex Karev to work in the clinic, while instructing Izzie to stay with her for the day. Dr. Shepherd and Dr. Bailey exchanged greetings, and Dr. Bailey noticed Meredith looked tired, warning her to hope the caffeine would kick in. Dr. Bailey handed Meredith a list of tasks, including a consult in the emergency department for a girl with fever and abdominal pain, and told her to get started immediately.

In the emergency department, a woman demanded help for her boyfriend, who had swallowed her keys to prevent her from leaving. The boyfriend admitted his actions, and Meredith was tasked with locating the keys. Meanwhile, another patient arrived with a gunshot wound, claiming his friend shot him as a favor because he liked the scars. The staff prepared to take him to the emergency area.

A group of male staff discussed tattoos and wrestling with the gunshot patient, Digby Owens. Digby explained his philosophy about pain and commitment, referencing his wrestling background. The conversation turned to jokes about men in tights and a mention of a flu spreading through the hospital.

Meredith examined a young woman named Claire, who resisted an abdominal exam. Meredith noticed recent surgical scars and questioned Claire, who begged her not to tell her parents. Meredith deduced that Claire had undergone surgery in Mexico to keep it secret from her parents and pressed her to reveal what procedure had been done.

Elsewhere, Jamie's parents discussed their daughter's condition with a doctor. Jamie had experienced foot twitching for three months, and a CT scan had revealed a brain abnormality. The parents brought Jamie to the hospital seeking better care, and the doctor reassured them that Dr. Shepherd, a brain specialist, would see Jamie.

In another area, a doctor discussed the boyfriend who had swallowed keys and suggested a bronchoscopy. The intern was told to perform the procedure alone and expressed gratitude for the opportunity, feeling their hard work was finally being recognized.

Meredith reported to Dr. Bailey about Claire, who was febrile and showed peritoneal signs. Cristina Yang, appearing ill, returned to the clinic. Meredith suspected Claire had undergone illegal surgery in Mexico, noting four laparoscopic scars and that her parents were unaware. Dr. Bailey instructed Meredith to order a CT scan and handed her more tasks. Cristina and another intern discussed the flu spreading in the hospital.

The interns gathered to discuss Meredith's relationship with Dr. Shepherd. Some worried that Meredith was receiving special treatment, while others debated whether Dr. Shepherd was taking advantage of her. The group argued about the risks of sleeping with attendings and the potential impact on their careers.

A staff member delivered Jamie's old CT scans to a doctor. Two staff members discussed Dr. Taylor, suspecting he smelled of alcohol. One insisted Dr. Taylor was the best anesthesiologist and only worried if he was too drunk to do his crossword.

A doctor discussed Jamie Hayes' case with Dr. Shepherd, noting her continuous seizure activity and the need for updated scans. Dr. Shepherd instructed them to order new imaging, as Jamie's brain could have changed significantly.

Doctors discussed Digby Owens' gunshot wound and his history of similar injuries, noting his affinity for pain and body art. Another doctor brought Claire Rice's CT scans to Dr. Bailey, who observed that Claire had undergone a gastric bypass, an unusual procedure for someone her age and size. Dr. Bailey explained the risks and complications to Claire's shocked parents, who agreed to surgery to reverse the bypass.

Jamie Hayes was prepared for an MRI. Her parents expressed concern about the cost of surgery, but the doctor reassured them. Jamie suffered a focal left-side seizure during the procedure, and the team administered diazepam, comforting her as best they could.

JP, the boyfriend who swallowed keys, was told he would undergo conscious sedation for the bronchoscopy. He and his partner argued about their relationship, accusing each other of passive-aggressive behavior and manipulation, until the partner was asked to leave the room.

Digby Owens was examined by doctors, who explained that his gunshot wound had caused a fractured rib and hemopneumothorax. Digby expressed pride in his pain tolerance and wrestling background. The doctors prepared to insert a chest tube to treat his collapsed lung.

Claire's parents confronted her about the surgery. Claire admitted she learned about it online and wanted to lose weight to focus on her studies. Her mother criticized her for taking shortcuts. The doctors explained that reversing the bypass was necessary for Claire's health, but Claire resisted, insisting she would rather be thin. The doctors informed her the choice was not hers.

Dr. Shepherd explained to Jamie's parents that she had Rasmussen's encephalitis, which was destroying part of her brain. The only treatment was to remove the diseased half of her brain. The parents were shocked, but Dr. Shepherd reassured them that, due to Jamie's age, her brain could compensate and she could live a relatively normal life if the surgery succeeded.

Dr. Shepherd offered George O'Malley the chance to scrub in on Jamie's hemispherectomy if the parents consented. George excitedly told the other interns, who expressed envy. The group discussed Meredith's relationship with Dr. Shepherd, with some expressing surprise and others joking about it. The conversation shifted to concerns about Dr. Taylor's possible drinking at work.

Digby Owens joked about his new scar and chatted with another patient about wrestling and trumpet playing. Digby felt dizzy from blood loss but encouraged a doctor to make time for wrestling. The doctors prepared to move on to other patients.

In surgery, doctors worked to reverse Claire's gastric bypass and free her bowel from adhesions. They discussed Claire's motivations and her desire for her mother's approval. Dr. Bailey reminded Meredith of her post-op duties and told her to pick up extra work because Cristina was sick. Meredith and Dr. Bailey had a tense exchange about Meredith's personal choices and professional responsibilities.

In the operating room, Dr. Bailey instructed Meredith on repairing an organ after draining it. Meredith was told to inform Claire's parents about her condition after showering. Meredith joked about smelling like her patient's insides, and her colleagues teased her about karma.

Dr. Shepherd prepared for Jamie's hemispherectomy and asked which intern was available. Cristina insisted she was healthy enough, but Dr. Bailey chose Meredith. Cristina was frustrated, believing Meredith was favored because of her relationship with Dr. Shepherd. Dr. Bailey sent Meredith to the OR.

A doctor noted that Digby Owens' post-op labs showed a high white blood cell count, indicating possible infection. The team was told to check for other sources of infection or recent illness.

In the OR, Dr. Shepherd began Jamie's hemispherectomy, describing the steps to the team. Cristina Yang was present.

A doctor informed Claire's parents that the gastric bypass had been reversed, but Claire had lost a significant portion of her bowel and would have lifelong nutrition problems. The parents argued about responsibility, with one suggesting Claire was trying to please her mother. The other parent denied responsibility, but the doctor insisted Claire worshiped her mother and did not do this for herself.

Digby Owens developed a fever and low blood pressure. The doctors discovered an infected tattoo on his calf, which had worsened since the morning. The infection, exacerbated by the gunshot, led to sepsis. Digby was sent to the ICU for antibiotics.

During Jamie's surgery, Dr. Shepherd noticed the anesthesia was too light. Dr. Taylor, the anesthesiologist, was found asleep at the table. The team woke him, and Dr. Shepherd ordered Taylor to leave and be replaced. Another doctor was called to take over anesthesia.

Digby Owens went into multisystem organ failure from sepsis. The team attempted to stabilize him with medication and defibrillation, but he lost his pulse. Efforts were made to resuscitate him.

Jamie Hayes' surgery concluded. Dr. Shepherd and Cristina Yang explained that the packing would prevent hemorrhaging and the cerebral spinal fluid would fill the cavity. The interns were allowed to close up. The team reflected on the intensity of the surgery and their exhaustion.

George O'Malley apologized to Dr. Shepherd for questioning Dr. Taylor's sobriety in the OR. Dr. Shepherd said he should have taken responsibility and that George did the right thing, regardless of the code among doctors.

Dr. Shepherd and another doctor discussed Meredith. Dr. Shepherd insisted he was not favoring her and said she was a great intern. They prepared to tell Jamie's parents that she would be fine, barring complications.

Meredith told Claire that the surgery was not able to completely fix her, and she would have lifelong dietary issues. Meredith said social services would contact Claire's parents to help her. Meredith told Claire that life was not supposed to be this hard.

Digby Owens died from sepsis, and the time of death was called. A character reflected on meeting someone from back home and the anonymity of being far from those who might judge you.

Late at night, Meredith and Izzie talked in the kitchen. Izzie confronted Meredith about her relationship with Dr. Shepherd, expressing frustration about Meredith's privileges and the risk to her credibility. Meredith insisted it was not about getting ahead or the surgeries. Izzie realized Meredith was falling for Dr. Shepherd. They joked about the situation and about cake.

A montage showed the interns reflecting on pain and why they might be drawn to it. Meredith and Dr. Shepherd talked quietly, considering whether to just sleep. Meredith wondered why people kept hurting themselves, concluding that it feels good when the pain stops.
