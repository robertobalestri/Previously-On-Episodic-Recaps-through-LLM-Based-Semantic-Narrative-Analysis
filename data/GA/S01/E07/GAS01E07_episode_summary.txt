The story began with Meredith Grey reflecting on the exhaustion of being a surgical intern, noting that sleepless nights were caused by more than just the demands of the job. Early in the morning, Meredith woke Derek Shepherd in her bedroom, urging him to leave before her roommates discovered his presence. Cristina Yang suggested letting Derek sleep, but Meredith insisted he had to go. Meanwhile, Izzie Stevens and George O'Malley speculated about Meredith's sex life, wondering if she was involved with Derek, their boss. Izzie questioned why Meredith kept the relationship secret if she wasn't ashamed, and when Meredith entered, her roommates teased her about her “radical sex” the previous night. Meredith deflected their questions, claiming the man was “no one you know.” Miranda Bailey interrupted, reminding the interns they were late.

As the day began, Bailey assigned George, Cristina, and Alex Karev to the clinic, keeping Izzie with her. Meredith, still tired, received a list of patients and tasks from Bailey, including a consult for a girl with fever and abdominal pain. Meredith encountered a patient whose boyfriend had swallowed her keys to prevent her from leaving him, and she was approached by a parent concerned about her daughter, Claire, who had been ill since returning from Mexico. Meredith examined Claire, who resisted the exam and asked for antibiotics to go home. Meredith insisted on the exam and discovered scars from recent surgery. Claire admitted to having surgery in Mexico to hide it from her parents, and Meredith suspected a gastric bypass, ordering further tests.

Meanwhile, Digby Owens arrived with a gunshot wound, explaining he was shot by a friend as a favor and that he liked the scars as part of his philosophy about pain and commitment. Meredith and other staff discussed the flu spreading through the hospital. Cristina, despite feeling ill, insisted she needed a “kick-ass surgery” to get through the day. The interns continued to gossip about Meredith and Derek, debating the ethics and risks of sleeping with attendings. Cristina pointed out that recommendations from attendings like Shepherd could make or break their careers.

Derek Shepherd reviewed Jamie Hayes, a young girl with a brain abnormality and continuous seizure activity. Meredith briefed him on Jamie's condition, and Shepherd ordered new scans. The team discussed Digby Owens' gunshot wound and his philosophy about pain. Meredith and Bailey reviewed Claire's CT scans, confirming she had a gastric bypass, which was unusual for a non-obese college student. Bailey explained to Claire's mother that Claire would face lifelong malnutrition unless the procedure was reversed.

Jamie underwent further testing, and her parents worried about the cost and potential need for surgery. Shepherd explained Jamie's condition, Rasmussen's encephalitis, and the need to remove half her brain to save her life. The risks and possible outcomes were discussed with her parents. George was invited to scrub in on the hemispherectomy, exciting the other interns.

The interns continued to discuss Meredith's relationship with Shepherd. Izzie confronted Meredith about her choices, expressing frustration over the perceived advantages Meredith had due to her background and connections. Meredith insisted her relationship with Shepherd was not about getting ahead or surgeries.

During surgery, Dr. Taylor, the anesthesiologist, was suspected of drinking on the job after staff smelled alcohol on him. George raised concerns, and Taylor was defensive. During Jamie's surgery, Taylor nodded off, confirming suspicions about his impairment. Steph, a nurse, was asked to get coffee for Taylor, and Hopkins took over anesthesia until Dr. Pennington arrived.

Digby Owens' condition worsened due to sepsis from an infected tattoo, exacerbated by the gunshot wound. The medical team attempted to stabilize him but ultimately pronounced his time of death.

Claire's bypass was reversed, but she would suffer from short gut syndrome and lifelong nutritional challenges. Meredith discussed with Claire's parents the pressures Claire faced to please her mother. Claire's mother was confronted with the reality that Claire's actions stemmed from a desire for approval.

After the surgeries, Meredith, Cristina, and Izzie reflected on the day's events. Cristina, still sick, expressed her love for being a surgeon. Meredith joked about karma, noting that despite getting the best surgeries, she now smelled like “putrid goo.” Bailey asked which intern was clear to assist Shepherd, and Meredith volunteered.

Bailey and Shepherd discussed the code among doctors about not questioning each other's personal lives within the hospital. Bailey admitted she was out of line earlier, and Shepherd reassured her that she did the right thing.

Meredith checked on Claire, explaining that social services would contact her parents to help her adjust to her new reality. Meredith reflected on the difficulty of life and the tendency to bring trouble upon oneself.

At home, Meredith and Izzie had a candid conversation. Izzie criticized Meredith for risking her credibility over a relationship with Shepherd, pointing out their different backgrounds and the respect Meredith received effortlessly. Meredith insisted her relationship was not about career advancement. Izzie realized Meredith was falling for Shepherd, which Meredith denied, but Izzie teased her about it.

As the night ended, Meredith reflected on pain and the choices people make, suggesting that perhaps people are wired to seek pain because it makes them feel real. Cristina suggested they could sleep, and Meredith joked about the saying, “Why do I keep hitting myself with a hammer? Because it feels so good when I stop.”
