Dr. Meredith Grey began her day narrating the challenges of being a surgical intern, describing how sleepless nights stemmed not only from the demands of the hospital but also from personal turmoil. Early in the morning, George O'Malley confided in Izzie Stevens about his longstanding feelings for their roommate Meredith. Izzie encouraged George to be direct and ask Meredith out, but George hesitated, unsure of how to express himself. Meanwhile, Meredith confronted Alex Karev about his abrasive attitude. Alex deflected with a joke, suggesting they share their secret pains over drinks, but Meredith declined, mentioning she was seeing someone. Alex then told George to give up on Meredith because she was "off the market." George, unconvinced, insisted he would know if Meredith were dating someone since they lived together.

At the hospital, Miranda Bailey warned Derek Shepherd that any favoritism toward Meredith would result in Meredith being barred from the operating room for a month. Meredith, after waking up early beside Derek, hurried him out before her roommates could see him and rushed to begin her rounds. Izzie and Cristina Yang teased Meredith about the noises from her room the previous night, speculating about her sex life. George, visibly jealous, joined the debate about whether Meredith was sleeping with Dr. Shepherd. Meredith denied the rumors and tried to change the subject.

During morning assignments, Bailey sent George, Cristina, and Alex to the clinic, while Izzie was to work directly with her. Meredith was dispatched to the emergency room to examine a girl named Claire Rice, who presented with fever and abdominal pain. Claire's mother blamed a recent trip to Mexico for her daughter's illness, but Claire resisted an exam until Meredith insisted. Meanwhile, a patient named Digby Owens arrived with a gunshot wound, claiming it was part of his artistic philosophy about pain and commitment.

Meredith discovered that Claire had recent abdominal surgery, with scars indicating a procedure performed in Mexico. Claire refused to tell her parents what had happened, prompting Meredith to suspect an illegal operation. Meredith discussed her concerns with Bailey, who ordered a CT scan. Elsewhere, a young girl named Jamie Hayes was admitted with a brain abnormality. Meredith reassured Jamie's parents and arranged for Dr. Shepherd to evaluate her.

Cristina received the opportunity to perform a bronchoscopy on her own, interpreting this as recognition of her dedication. Meredith continued to juggle her cases, including Digby, whose fever was worsening due to his gunshot wound. The interns gathered to discuss the risks of sleeping with attendings and the intense pressures of their internship.

Bailey and Meredith reviewed Claire's CT scans and discovered she had undergone a gastric bypass, a surgery typically reserved for obese patients, though Claire was of normal weight. Claire's parents were shocked by the revelation. Bailey explained the risks and the necessity of reversing the surgery. Claire, desperate to remain thin, resisted, but Bailey insisted the decision was out of her hands due to the severity of her medical complications.

Dr. Shepherd diagnosed Jamie with Rasmussen's encephalitis, a progressive brain disease. He explained to Jamie's parents that the only cure was a hemispherectomy, the removal of the diseased half of her brain. Overwhelmed, Jamie's parents consented to the surgery. George was invited to scrub in on the rare procedure and excitedly shared the news with his friends.

During the operation, Dr. Taylor, the anesthesiologist, was suspected of drinking on the job after George and others detected the smell of alcohol. Dr. Shepherd confronted Taylor, who denied the accusation but later nodded off during surgery, nearly causing a crisis. Shepherd and the surgical team managed the situation, and Taylor was removed from the operating room.

Meanwhile, Digby Owens' condition deteriorated due to an infected tattoo worsened by his gunshot wound. He was transferred to the ICU and started on antibiotics, but soon went into multisystem organ failure. The medical team attempted to resuscitate him.

Claire's surgery to reverse the bypass was successful, but she lost a significant portion of her bowel and would face lifelong nutritional challenges. Bailey and Meredith spoke with Claire's mother, reflecting on how Claire's need for approval may have driven her to such a risky decision.

After Jamie's hemispherectomy, Cristina explained to the other interns how the brain would compensate for the loss. Exhausted, the interns reflected on the intensity and reality of their work. Dr. Shepherd and George discussed the incident with Dr. Taylor, acknowledging the importance of responsibility and the unspoken code among doctors.

At home, Meredith and Izzie talked about Meredith's relationship with Dr. Shepherd. Izzie, feeling she had to work harder for respect, expressed frustration that Meredith was risking her reputation. Cristina realized Meredith was falling for Shepherd, which Meredith initially denied but then admitted. The friends teased Meredith about her love life.

As the day ended, Meredith reflected on the idea that people might be wired to seek pain because it makes them feel real. In a quiet moment, Derek and Meredith joked together about why people keep hitting themselves with a hammerâ€”because it feels so good when they stop.
