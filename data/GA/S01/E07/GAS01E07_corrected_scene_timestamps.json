Bailey ultimately allows Meredith to shower first. In the locker room, Meredith jokes to Izzie Stevens and Cristina Yang that she smells like \u201ckarma,\u201d while Izzie points out something disgusting stuck in Meredith\u2019s hair. The three discuss how Meredith always seems to get the most challenging surgeries, even if it means ending up covered in unpleasant fluids. Suddenly, Bailey calls for an intern to assist Derek Shepherd in the OR. Cristina, still recovering from illness, insists she\u2019s well enough to go, but Bailey chooses Meredith instead. Frustrated, Cristina accuses Meredith of receiving special treatment because of her relationship with Shepherd.",
