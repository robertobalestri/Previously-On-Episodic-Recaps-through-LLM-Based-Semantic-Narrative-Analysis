George and Izzie discover that Derek is the mysterious stranger sleeping with Meredith, leading to George's jealousy and Izzie's concern about Meredith's recent surgical successes. A flu outbreak affects the hospital, and Cristina feels ill, blaming Dr. Burke. Meanwhile, Alex attends to a scheduled gunshot wound victim whose friend shot him with permission, while Meredith assists Bailey with a case involving a teenager who underwent an unauthorized gastric bypass in Mexico.

George initially participates in a significant surgery on a toddler with severe tremors, where Derek determines that a hemispherectomy is necessary to halt brain tissue deterioration. However, George becomes concerned about Dr. Taylor, the anesthesiologist, whom he suspects is under the influence of alcohol. Despite George's warning, Derek sides with Dr. Taylor, resulting in George being removed from the surgery and replaced by Cristina.

Meredith learns that her patient's issues stem from pressure to meet her mother's expectations, but the reversal of the gastric bypass leads to complications, including the patient's bowel exploding. Alex's tattooed patient deteriorates and ultimately dies due to an infected tattoo exacerbated by the gunshot wound.

During the hemispherectomy, the little girl wakes up as Derek is operating, revealing that Dr. Taylor is asleep. Derek ejects Dr. Taylor from the surgery and later apologizes to George, admitting his feelings for Meredith. Izzie confronts Meredith about her relationship with Derek but ultimately feels sympathy for her when she realizes Meredith is in love with him.

Cristina, suspecting her flu symptoms may indicate pregnancy, takes two tests and is unhappy with the results.
