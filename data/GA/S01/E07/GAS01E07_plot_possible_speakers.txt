Dr. Meredith Grey narrates that being an intern means sleepless nights, not just from work but from personal issues. George O'Malley confides to Izzie Stevens that he has had feelings for his roommate Meredith since the beginning but can't tell her. Izzie suggests he just ask her out, but George is hesitant. Meredith confronts Alex Karev about his attitude, and Alex jokes about sharing his secret pain over drinks. Meredith declines, saying she's seeing someone. Alex tells George to give up because Meredith is "off the market," but George insists he would know if Meredith were seeing someone since they live together.

Miranda Bailey warns Derek Shepherd that if she sees him favoring Meredith, she will make sure Meredith doesn't enter an OR for a month. Meredith wakes up early, tells Derek he has to leave before her roommates see him, and rushes to start her rounds. Izzie and Cristina Yang tease Meredith about the noise from her room the previous night, speculating about her sex life. George is jealous, and the roommates debate whether Meredith is sleeping with Dr. Shepherd, their boss. Meredith denies it and tries to avoid the subject.

At the hospital, Bailey assigns George, Cristina, and Alex to the clinic, while Izzie is to work with her. Meredith is sent to the ER to see a girl, Claire Rice, with fever and abdominal pain. Claire's mother blames a recent trip to Mexico for her illness. Claire resists an exam, but Meredith insists. Meanwhile, a patient named Digby Owens arrives with a gunshot wound, which he claims is part of his "art" and ethos about pain and commitment.

Meredith discovers Claire has had recent abdominal surgery, with scars suggesting a procedure done in Mexico. Claire refuses to tell her parents what happened. Meredith suspects an illegal surgery and discusses it with Bailey, who orders a CT scan. Meanwhile, Jamie Hayes, a young girl with a brain abnormality, is admitted. Meredith reassures Jamie's parents and arranges for Dr. Shepherd to see her.

Cristina is given the opportunity to perform a bronchoscopy alone, which she sees as a sign her hard work is being noticed. Meredith continues to juggle her cases, including Digby, who is running a fever due to his gunshot wound. The interns discuss the risks of sleeping with attendings and the pressures of the program.

Bailey and Meredith review Claire's CT scans and discover she had a gastric bypass, a procedure usually reserved for obese patients, but Claire is of normal weight. Claire's parents are shocked, and Bailey explains the risks and the need to reverse the surgery. Claire resists, wanting to remain thin, but Bailey insists the choice is not hers due to the medical complications.

Dr. Shepherd diagnoses Jamie with Rasmussen's encephalitis, a progressive brain disease. He explains to her parents that the only cure is to remove the diseased half of her brain, a hemispherectomy. The parents are overwhelmed but consent to the surgery. George is invited to scrub in on the rare procedure and excitedly tells his friends.

In the OR, Dr. Taylor, the anesthesiologist, is suspected of drinking on the job after George and others smell alcohol. Dr. Shepherd confronts Taylor, who denies it but later nods off during surgery, nearly causing a crisis. Shepherd and the team manage the situation, and Taylor is removed from the OR.

Meanwhile, Digby Owens' condition worsens due to an infected tattoo, exacerbated by his gunshot wound. He is moved to the ICU and started on antibiotics, but he goes into multisystem organ failure. The team attempts to resuscitate him.

Claire's surgery to reverse the bypass is successful, but she loses a significant portion of her bowel and will have lifelong nutritional problems. Bailey and Meredith discuss with Claire's mother how Claire's need for approval may have contributed to her risky decision.

After the hemispherectomy, Cristina explains to the team how the brain will compensate for the loss. The interns are exhausted but reflect on the intensity and reality of their work. Dr. Shepherd and George discuss the incident with Dr. Taylor, acknowledging the importance of responsibility and the code among doctors.

At home, Meredith and Izzie talk about Meredith's relationship with Shepherd. Izzie, who feels she has to work harder for respect, is frustrated that Meredith is risking her reputation. Cristina realizes Meredith is falling for Shepherd, which Meredith denies but ultimately admits. The friends tease each other about Meredith's love life.

The episode ends with Meredith reflecting that maybe people are wired to seek pain because it makes them feel real. Derek and Meredith share a quiet moment, joking about why people keep hitting themselves with a hammerâ€”because it feels so good when they stop.
