The episode opens with a recap narrated by Meredith Grey, referencing previous events. George O'Malley confides to Izzie Stevens that he has had feelings for his roommate since day one but cannot tell her. Izzie encourages him to ask her out, questioning if he is truly as shallow as he seems. Alex Karev jokes about sharing his secret pain over drinks, but Meredith declines, saying she is seeing someone. Cristina Yang warns George that Meredith is "off the market," but George insists he would know if she were seeing someone, as he lives with her.

Miranda Bailey confronts Meredith about her relationship with an attending, warning that favoritism could lead to resentment among other interns. Meredith questions the nature of her relationship with Derek Shepherd, who asks if she needs a definition. Bailey threatens to keep Meredith out of the OR if she sees any favoritism.

Meredith narrates about the exhaustion of being an intern, noting that it's not just the job that keeps them up at night. She wakes Derek early in the morning, telling him he must leave before her roommates see him. Cristina suggests letting Derek sleep, but Meredith insists he must go. Izzie and George gossip about Meredith's sex life, speculating about her relationship with Derek, who is their boss. Izzie wonders why Meredith is keeping it a secret if she's not ashamed. Meredith enters, and her roommates tease her about her "radical sex" the previous night. Meredith deflects questions about the identity of the man, saying it's "no one you know." Bailey interrupts, reminding the interns they are late.

As the day begins, Bailey assigns George, Yang, and Karev to the clinic, keeping Izzie with her. Meredith, still tired, is told by Bailey to pray for caffeine to kick in. Bailey gives Meredith a list of patients and tasks, including a consult for a girl with fever and abdominal pain. Meredith encounters a patient whose boyfriend swallowed her keys to prevent her from leaving him. She is also approached by a parent concerned about her daughter, Claire, who has been ill since returning from a trip to Mexico.

Meredith examines Claire, who resists the exam and asks for antibiotics to go home. Meredith insists on the exam, discovering scars from recent surgery. Claire admits to having surgery in Mexico to hide it from her parents. Meredith suspects a gastric bypass and orders further tests. Meanwhile, Digby Owens, a tattooed patient, arrives with a gunshot wound, explaining he was shot by a friend as a favor and that he likes the scars as part of his "ethos" about pain and commitment.

Meredith and other staff discuss the flu spreading through the hospital. Cristina, despite feeling ill, insists she needs a "kick-ass surgery" to get through the day. The interns continue to gossip about Meredith and Derek, debating the ethics and risks of sleeping with attendings. Cristina points out that recommendations from attendings like Shepherd can make or break their careers.

Dr. Shepherd reviews Jamie Hayes, a young girl with a brain abnormality and continuous seizure activity. Meredith briefs him on Jamie's condition, and Shepherd orders new scans. The team discusses Digby Owens' gunshot wound and his philosophy about pain. Meredith and Bailey review Claire's CT scans, confirming she had a gastric bypass, which is unusual for a non-obese college student. Bailey explains to Claire's mother that Claire will face lifelong malnutrition unless the procedure is reversed.

Jamie undergoes further testing, and her parents worry about the cost and potential need for surgery. Shepherd explains Jamie's condition, Rasmussen's encephalitis, and the need to remove half her brain to save her life. The risks and possible outcomes are discussed with her parents. George is invited to scrub in on the hemispherectomy, exciting the other interns.

The interns continue to discuss Meredith's relationship with Shepherd. Izzie confronts Meredith about her choices, expressing frustration over the perceived advantages Meredith has due to her background and connections. Meredith insists her relationship with Shepherd is not about getting ahead or surgeries.

During surgery, Dr. Taylor, the anesthesiologist, is suspected of drinking on the job after staff smell alcohol on him. George raises concerns, and Taylor is defensive. During Jamie's surgery, Taylor nods off, confirming suspicions about his impairment. Steph, a nurse, is asked to get coffee for Taylor, and Hopkins takes over anesthesia until Dr. Pennington arrives.

Digby Owens' condition worsens due to sepsis from an infected tattoo, exacerbated by the gunshot wound. The medical team attempts to stabilize him but ultimately pronounces his time of death.

Claire's bypass is reversed, but she will suffer from short gut syndrome and lifelong nutritional challenges. Meredith discusses with Claire's parents the pressures Claire faces to please her mother. Claire's mother is confronted with the reality that Claire's actions stem from a desire for approval.

After the surgeries, Meredith, Cristina, and Izzie reflect on the day's events. Cristina, still sick, expresses her love for being a surgeon. Meredith jokes about karma, noting that despite getting the best surgeries, she now smells like "putrid goo." Bailey asks which intern is clear to assist Shepherd, and Meredith volunteers.

Bailey and Shepherd discuss the code among doctors about not questioning each other's personal lives within the hospital. Bailey admits she was out of line earlier, and Shepherd reassures her that she did the right thing.

Meredith checks on Claire, explaining that social services will contact her parents to help her adjust to her new reality. Meredith narrates about the difficulty of life and the tendency to bring trouble upon oneself.

At home, Meredith and Izzie have a candid conversation. Izzie criticizes Meredith for risking her credibility over a relationship with Shepherd, pointing out their different backgrounds and the respect Meredith receives effortlessly. Meredith insists her relationship is not about career advancement. Izzie realizes Meredith is falling for Shepherd, which Meredith denies, but Izzie teases her about it.

The episode ends with Meredith reflecting on pain and the choices people make, suggesting that perhaps they are wired to seek pain because it makes them feel real. Cristina suggests they could sleep, and Meredith jokes about the saying, "Why do I keep hitting myself with a hammer? Because it feels so good when I stop."
