3
00:00:05,394 --> 00:00:07,440

4
00:00:08,663 --> 00:00:10,125

5
00:00:10,768 --> 00:00:12,913

15
00:00:25,937 --> 00:00:37,332
Miranda Bailey / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): And the longer this little fling goes on, the more favors you get over the others who are fighting to the nail just to make it through this program when those people start finding out what's going on.

16
00:00:37,713 --> 00:00:39,576

Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Okay, anyone who says you can sleep when you die, tell them to come talk to me after a few months as an intern.

20
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,245
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Of course, it's not just the job that keeps us up all night.

21

27
00:01:20,066 --> 00:01:21,608

28
00:01:22,144 --> 00:01:24,408

29
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:24,486

30
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:24,828

32
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:28,152

37
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:41,265

38
00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:43,027
Izzie Stevens / Izzie Stevens (PVM): Oh, jelly.

39
00:01:43,048 --> 00:01:44,509
George O'Malley / Meredith Grey OR Izzie Stevens (PVM): You're not jealous.

40
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,051

43
00:02:05,102 --> 00:02:05,903

51
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:18,637
Izzie Stevens / Izzie Stevens (PVM): Well, if she's not ashamed of it, why is she keeping it a secret?

52
00:02:19,157 --> 00:02:19,776
George O'Malley / Meredith Grey (PVM): Maybe she didn't.

53
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:21,818

60

65
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:47,394

00:05:54,927 --> 00:05:55,610
Claire / Meredith Grey (PVM): I'm fine.

149
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:59,134
Claire's Parent / Meredith Grey (PVM): For God's sake, Claire, I don't want to spend my entire day here.

150
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:05,939
Meredith / Meredith Grey (PVM): You know, actually, Mrs. Rice, this might be easier if we had some privacy.

151
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,701
Meredith / Meredith Grey (PVM): So would you two mind leaving the room?

152
00:06:09,483 --> 00:06:14,949
Mrs. Rice / Digby Owens OR Mrs. Rice (PVM): That's fine.

153
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:15,370
Meredith / Digby Owens (PVM): Digby.

154
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,271
Digby Owens: Digby Owens.

155
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:20,336
Digby Owens: I have an appointment.

156
00:06:20,355 --> 00:06:20,956

157
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:22,158
Meredith / Digby Owens OR Digby Owens OR Digby Owens (PVM): You're bleeding.

158
00:06:22,177 --> 00:06:23,139

159
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,860
Digby Owens: Sure, sure.

160
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:24,701
Meredith / Digby Owens (PVM): Have a look.

161
00:06:26,584 --> 00:06:27,305
Meredith / Digby Owens (PVM): That's a gunshot.

162
00:06:27,824 --> 00:06:27,925
Digby Owens: Yeah.

163
00:06:27,944 --> 00:06:28,987

164
00:06:29,007 --> 00:06:30,266

165
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:32,468
Digby Owens: I'm sorry.

166
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:32,949

167
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:36,817
Digby Owens: Mr. Dickby, all right, but just remember, see, look, I scheduled this.

168
00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:38,019
Meredith / Digby Owens (PVM): What, gunshot?

169
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,461
Digby Owens: Yeah, my buddy shot me.

170
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:39,843
Meredith / Digby Owens (PVM): Your buddy?

171
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:41,564
Digby Owens: Yeah, just as a favor.

172
00:06:41,826 --> 00:06:42,266
Meredith / Digby Owens (PVM): On purpose?

173
00:06:42,288 --> 00:06:42,728
Digby Owens: Hell, yeah.

174
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:44,692
Digby Owens: I mean, he wasn't trying to hurt me or nothing, but you know.

175
00:06:44,992 --> 00:06:45,433
Jamie / Digby Owens (PVM): But why?

176
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:47,497
Jamie / Digby Owens (PVM): I like the scars.

177
00:07:17,684 --> 00:07:21,250
Tattooed Patient / Meredith Grey OR Digby Owens (PVM): Look, everyone in town has tats, but my art is about commitment.

178
00:07:21,752 --> 00:07:23,596
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): So this is your art, huh?

179
00:07:23,615 --> 00:07:24,396
Tattooed Patient / Meredith Grey (PVM): Damn straight.

180
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:26,180
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Damn stupid.

181
00:07:26,201 --> 00:07:27,483
Tattooed Patient / Meredith Grey (PVM): The bullet went all the way through.

182
00:07:27,862 --> 00:07:29,146
Tattooed Patient / Digby Owens (PVM): Bounced off my ribs.

183
00:07:29,547 --> 00:07:31,451
Tattooed Patient / Digby Owens (PVM): I have another one still in my shoulder.

184
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:33,093
Meredith Grey / Digby Owens OR Digby Owens (PVM): Nice, huh?

185
00:07:34,596 --> 00:07:35,980
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): You could hang it in the Louvre.

186
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:38,252
Tattooed Patient / Digby Owens OR Digby Owens (PVM): I have an ethos.

187
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:41,896
Tattooed Patient / Digby Owens OR Digby Owens (PVM): Why do anything unless you're willing to go one step further than anybody else?

188
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,076
Meredith Grey / Digby Owens (PVM): What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right?

189
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:44,939
Tattooed Patient / Digby Owens (PVM): Exactly.

190
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,740
Tattooed Patient / Digby Owens (PVM): And pain is the great divide.

191
00:07:47,242 --> 00:07:50,004
Tattooed Patient / Digby Owens (PVM): My coach used to say it's all about how we process pain.

192
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:51,447
Meredith Grey / Digby Owens (PVM): Football?

193
00:07:51,466 --> 00:07:52,567

194
00:07:53,228 --> 00:07:53,930

196
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:55,492

197
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:57,593
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey OR Digby Owens (PVM): Well, you gotta be more than 180 now.

198
00:07:57,994 --> 00:07:59,716
Meredith Grey / Digby Owens (PVM): I'd like to see you get back under 145.

199
00:08:00,475 --> 00:08:05,442
Jamie's Parent / Meredith Grey (PVM): Excuse me, but thinking of you men in tights makes me want to puke.

200
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,084
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): There's a flu going around the hospital.

201
00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:09,625
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Somewhat ironic.

202
00:08:13,112 --> 00:08:13,231
Tattooed Patient / Steph (PVM): Ow.

203
00:08:15,653 --> 00:08:16,697
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey OR Steph (PVM): Don't push so hard.

204
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:33,523
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Can you lift your shirt so I can examine your stomach?

205
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:45,456
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Where did you get these?

206
00:08:45,499 --> 00:08:52,788
Jamie Hayes: There.

207
00:08:52,808 --> 00:08:54,211
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): You've had surgery recently.

208
00:08:54,874 --> 00:08:56,134
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): These scars are still pink.

209
00:08:57,378 --> 00:08:58,418
Jamie Hayes: Don't tell my parents.

210
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:05,250
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): You did this in Mexico so your parents wouldn't know?

211
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:06,091
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): What did you have done?

212
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:15,769
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): And you noticed her foot twitching?

213
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:16,571
Parent (Mrs. Hayes or Mr. Hayes) / Meredith Grey (PVM): Come on, Jamie.

214
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:18,855
Jamie Hayes: Oh, yeah.

215
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,157
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): About three months ago?

216
00:09:20,397 --> 00:09:21,057
Jamie Hayes: Just a little.

217
00:09:21,619 --> 00:09:26,807
Jamie's Parent: We took her to county hospital, and she got the CT scan, which showed her brain abnormality.

218
00:09:27,206 --> 00:09:27,908
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Here, you can put it.

219
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,850
Jamie's Parent: And the twitching has gotten worse.

220
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:30,812
Jamie's Parent: A lot worse.

221
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,918
Jamie's Parent: They just don't have the proper equipment back home to figure out what's wrong.

222
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,341
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey OR Jamie Hayes (PVM): You did a good thing.

223
00:09:37,802 --> 00:09:39,066
Jamie Hayes: Yes, your mommy.

224
00:09:40,024 --> 00:09:44,451
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey OR Jamie's Parent (PVM): Okay, you did a good thing by coming all this way, Mr. and Mrs. Hayes.

225
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:45,754
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): You sit tight, Jamie, okay?

226
00:09:46,355 --> 00:09:49,120
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): I'm gonna bring in Dr. Shepherd to see you, okay?

227
00:09:49,642 --> 00:09:51,085
Jamie (patient) / Meredith Grey (PVM): Dr. Shepherd, okay?

228
00:09:51,846 --> 00:09:53,008
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): He's the brain specialist.

229
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:54,370
Jamie Hayes: To Mommy.

230
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,931
Jamie Hayes: To Mommy and Daddy.

231
00:09:54,951 --> 00:09:58,037
Jamie's Parent: Doctor, is he good, this Dr. Shepherd?

232
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:00,902
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey OR Jamie's Parent (PVM): At just about everything,

233
00:10:03,464 --> 00:10:07,671
Alex Karev / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I assume the lady needs her keys to leave this guy's sorry ass behind.

234
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:08,993
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Yeah.

235
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:11,177
Alex Karev / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Well, how about?

236
00:10:11,197 --> 00:10:12,177
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): He needs a bronchoscopy.

237
00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:13,961
Alex Karev / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): So you want to do one, teach one.

238
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,682
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You've seen one.

239
00:10:14,743 --> 00:10:15,464
Alex Karev / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): It's time to do one.

240
00:10:16,205 --> 00:10:16,485
George O'Malley / Meredith Grey OR Izzie Stevens (PVM): Alone?

241
00:10:16,524 --> 00:10:17,966
Izzie Stevens / Jamie's Parent (PVM): Seriously?

242
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:19,009
George O'Malley / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Thanks.

243
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:20,913
George O'Malley / Meredith Grey OR Izzie Stevens (PVM): I mean, the vote of confidence in my skills and all.

244
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:24,298
George O'Malley / Meredith Grey OR Izzie Stevens (PVM): I didn't think you, well, anyone was noticing how hard I have been working with you.

245
00:10:24,317 --> 00:10:24,538
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): Easy.

246
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,000
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Go.

247
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:26,065
Dr. Bailey / Meredith Grey (PVM): You paged?

248
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:26,605
Dr. Bailey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Where are we?

249
00:10:27,048 --> 00:10:30,135
George O'Malley / Meredith Grey (PVM): I did the consult, did the IV, the meds, the post-ops, everything.

250
00:10:30,216 --> 00:10:31,019
Dr. Bailey / Meredith Grey (PVM): How's your pit patient?

251
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:33,206
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): She's febrile and has peritoneal signs.

252
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:34,649
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You all right, Dr. Yang?

253
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,796
Dr. Cristina Yang: Fine.

254
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:38,278
Dr. Cristina Yang: On my way back to clinic.

255
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:41,224
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): I think she had some sort of illegal surgery done in Mexico.

256
00:10:41,543 --> 00:10:42,264
Alex Karev / Meredith Grey (PVM): Botched abortion?

257
00:10:42,485 --> 00:10:42,706
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): No.

258
00:10:42,806 --> 00:10:46,671
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): She has four laparoscopic scars on her abdomen and won't say what they're from.

259
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:47,772
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey (PVM): And the parents are clueless.

260
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:48,393
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey OR Meredith Grey (PVM): She's a minor.

261
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:50,115
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): 17, freshman in college.

262
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:51,375
Attending Doctor / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You order her up for a CT?

263
00:10:51,475 --> 00:10:51,735
Junior Doctor / Resident / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Yes.

264
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,642
Attending Doctor / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): So while she's there, the nurses couldn't get a Foley on Mr. Garay.

265
00:10:55,701 --> 00:10:58,004
Attending Doctor / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. Cristina Yang OR Izzie Stevens (PVM): He may need a cadet cath if you can't get a normal one in there.

266
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:02,870
Attending Doctor / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Write up post-op notes on all surgical floor patients that are esky surgery within the last 24 hours.

267
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:06,053
Attending Doctor / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Be sure to document their EKGs and x-rays.

268
00:11:06,455 --> 00:11:07,995
Attending Doctor / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Hunt them down if you can't find them.

269
00:11:07,975 --> 00:11:08,618
Junior Doctor / Resident / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Right away.

270
00:11:09,957 --> 00:11:10,038
Another Doctor / Resident / Digby Owens (PVM): Hey.

271
00:11:10,057 --> 00:11:10,519
Doctor or Resident / Steph OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Whoa.

272
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,725
Doctor or Resident / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Digby Owens (PVM): You got the flu?

273
00:11:16,065 --> 00:11:17,186
Doctor or Resident / Meredith Grey OR Digby Owens (PVM): Yeah, and thanks for it.

274
00:11:17,206 --> 00:11:18,527
Doctor or Resident / Digby Owens (PVM): It's making my life so much easier.

275
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:20,249
Doctor or Resident / Digby Owens (PVM): I didn't give it to you.

276
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:21,288
Doctor or Resident / Digby Owens (PVM): It's all over the hospital.

277
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:22,990
Doctor or Resident / Digby Owens (PVM): You should be in bed.

278
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:26,475
Doctor or Resident / Meredith Grey (PVM): Disease diagnosis and prescription from one man.

279
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:28,817
Doctor or Resident / Digby Owens (PVM): Seriously, I'll give you a ride home.

280
00:11:29,418 --> 00:11:30,817
Doctor or Resident / Meredith Grey OR Digby Owens (PVM): This is not going to make me go home.

281
00:11:31,538 --> 00:11:32,139
Doctor or Resident / Digby Owens (PVM): You go home.

282
00:11:33,422 --> 00:11:34,423
Doctor or Resident / Digby Owens (PVM): But I feel fine.

283
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:43,870
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): Hey, hey, hey, have you seen Shepard?

284
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:45,831
Alex Karev / Meredith Grey OR Izzie Stevens (PVM): Not as up close as Meredith has.

285
00:11:46,614 --> 00:11:46,715
Meredith Grey / Izzie Stevens (PVM): What?

286
00:11:46,735 --> 00:11:47,696
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey OR Izzie Stevens (PVM): Are you trying to get her in trouble?

287
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:48,418
Cristina Yang / Izzie Stevens (PVM): She's our friend.

288
00:11:48,576 --> 00:11:51,841
Cristina Yang / Izzie Stevens (PVM): George, this program will make or break our careers, OK?

289
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:53,745
Cristina Yang / Izzie Stevens (PVM): Some of us will make it through, and some of us won't.

290
00:11:53,807 --> 00:11:57,952
Cristina Yang / Izzie Stevens (PVM): And that decision depends entirely on recommendations from doctors like Shepard.

291
00:11:58,673 --> 00:12:00,518
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): There is a reason we don't sleep with the attendants.

292
00:12:00,538 --> 00:12:01,620
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey (PVM): It's not her fault it's Shepard's.

293
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:02,562
George O'Malley / Meredith Grey (PVM): He's the attending.

294
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:03,403
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): He should know better.

295
00:12:03,663 --> 00:12:04,745
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey OR Izzie Stevens (PVM): He's taking advantage of her.

296
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:07,971

00:15:35,854 --> 00:15:38,440

380
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,023

381
00:15:40,043 --> 00:15:40,845

396
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:10,360

398
00:16:12,283 --> 00:16:13,485

404
00:16:23,673 --> 00:16:28,298
Doctor / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Taylor OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): It's amazing stuff, isn't it?

405
00:16:28,317 --> 00:16:29,240

406
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:30,322

407

Medical Staff / Meredith Grey (PVM): OK.

408
00:16:31,263 --> 00:16:35,509

410
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,716

411
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:42,912
JP / Meredith Grey (PVM): Perfect.

412
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:45,196

413
00:16:45,274 --> 00:16:46,658
JP / Jamie's Parent (PVM): I was hoping to be in Portland right now.

414
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:50,085
Medical Staff / Izzie Stevens (PVM): You're gonna be under conscious sedation, JP, which means you'll be awake but groggy.

415
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,230
JP / Izzie Stevens (PVM): Is this gonna hurt?

416
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,695

419
00:17:00,648 --> 00:17:02,090
Athena / Digby Owens (PVM): Romantic.

420
00:17:02,591 --> 00:17:04,432
JP / Jamie's Parent (PVM): Like the therapist thing was funny and romantic?

421
00:17:04,452 --> 00:17:05,516
Athena / Digby Owens OR Jamie's Parent (PVM): That was funny.

422
00:17:05,615 --> 00:17:06,758
JP / Jamie's Parent (PVM): No, that was sad.

423
00:17:06,998 --> 00:17:11,183
Athena / Izzie Stevens OR Jamie's Parent (PVM): He called my therapist pretending to be his therapist to find out what I'd said about him.

424
00:17:11,345 --> 00:17:12,987
Medical Staff / Jamie's Parent (PVM): He's a little passive-aggressive, isn't he?

425
00:17:13,008 --> 00:17:13,428
Athena / Jamie's Parent (PVM): A little.

426
00:17:13,448 --> 00:17:14,971
Athena / Jamie's Parent (PVM): He is the king of passive-aggressive.

427
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,834
Athena / Jamie's Parent (PVM): And he's manipulative.

428
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:17,913
Athena / Jamie's Parent (PVM): And needy.

429
00:17:19,217 --> 00:17:20,077
Medical Staff / Izzie Stevens OR Jamie's Parent (PVM): That's the trifecta.

430
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:21,221
Athena / Digby Owens OR Izzie Stevens (PVM): What do I win?

431
00:17:25,185 --> 00:17:25,547
JP / Izzie Stevens (PVM): What?

432
00:17:27,911 --> 00:17:28,510
Athena / Digby Owens (PVM): Duh.

433
00:17:30,971 --> 00:17:32,713
Doctor / Digby Owens (PVM): I prefer we stop meeting like this, Mr. Owens.

434
00:17:33,414 --> 00:17:33,895
Digby Owens: Digby.

435
00:17:35,116 --> 00:17:36,721
Doctor / Digby Owens (PVM): So how's the trumpet playing?

436
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,502
Digby Owens: Very safe compared to your hobby.

437
00:17:40,487 --> 00:17:42,209
Doctor / Digby Owens (PVM): Getting shot is a little more risky.

438
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:43,289
Digby Owens: That's kind of the point.

439
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,034
Doctor / Digby Owens (PVM): He's running a fever.

440
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:48,057
Doctor / Digby Owens OR Digby Owens (PVM): Due to the extra stress on his body from the gunshot.

441
00:17:48,077 --> 00:17:55,951
Doctor: Digby, the impact of the bullet in your chest fractured a rib and caused a hemopneumothorax.

442
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:56,730
Digby Owens: That sucks, I guess.

443
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,733
Doctor: Well, there's blood in your collapsed lung.

444
00:17:59,103 --> 00:18:01,226
Doctor: The price of body art went up since your last gunshot.

445
00:18:01,826 --> 00:18:03,048
Digby Owens: Eh, no pain, no gain, right?

446
00:18:03,489 --> 00:18:04,391
Doctor: That's one way to look at it.

447
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,634
Digby Owens: And we have that in common, you docs and me.

448
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:07,473
Doctor / Digby Owens OR Digby Owens (PVM): Do it.

449
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,818
Digby Owens: Yeah, the way you guys push and push and push.

450
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:15,125
Digby Owens: When I was wrestling, if you wanted to pin me, you was gonna have to kill me.

451
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:16,887
Doctor / Digby Owens (PVM): Iowa style.

452
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:18,171
Digby Owens: Iowa State style.

453
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:20,534
Doctor / Digby Owens OR Digby Owens (PVM): Back home, we were sworn enemies.

454
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,659
Digby Owens: But here in Seattle, man, we're brothers.

455
00:18:26,643 --> 00:18:30,548
Digby Owens: Now, so what are we going to do about this, uh, hemo-numo-jurassic?

456
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:33,751
Doctor: We're going to insert a chest tube to drain the blood and then reinflate your lung.

457
00:18:35,977 --> 00:18:36,395
Digby Owens: Oh, please.

458
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:38,681
Digby Owens: Tell me I get to watch.

459
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:47,393
Digby Owens: Oh, man.

460
00:18:47,413 --> 00:18:50,278
Doctor / Meredith Grey OR Digby Owens (PVM): I will stop.

461
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:52,140
Claire Rice: Before you guys start, I know you're mad.

462
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,582
Claire's Mother / Meredith Grey (PVM): Disbelief, Claire.

463
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:53,981
Claire's Mother / Meredith Grey (PVM): Just...

464
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,131
Claire's Mother / Meredith Grey (PVM): Disbelief.

465
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:56,913
Claire's Father / Meredith Grey (PVM): I'm just concerned.

466
00:18:57,817 --> 00:18:59,480
Claire's Father / Meredith Grey (PVM): Where did you get the idea to do this?

467
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,163
Claire Rice: The internet.

468
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,670
Claire's Mother / Meredith Grey (PVM): But honey, there is a healthy way to lose weight.

469
00:19:06,614 --> 00:19:12,443
Claire Rice: Yeah, I've tried that, but it doesn't work for me like it does for you.

470
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,905
Claire's Mother / Meredith Grey (PVM): Hey, you don't need to lose weight.

471
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:17,147
Claire's Father / Meredith Grey (PVM): What are you waiting?

472
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,471
Claire's Father / Meredith Grey (PVM): And how much have you been working out?

473
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:23,819
Claire's Father / Meredith Grey (PVM): I mean, you know, most of the time when people hit their target weight, they have to work to stay there.

474
00:19:24,442 --> 00:19:26,987
Claire Rice: Everyone gains weight in college, Mom.

475
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,491
Claire Rice: It's stressful.

476
00:19:31,335 --> 00:19:35,781
Claire Rice: There's not enough time for exercise.

477
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:44,459
Claire Rice: I just thought if I wasn't worried about my diet, then I could focus more on my studies.

478
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:46,401
Claire's Mother / Meredith Grey (PVM): So you took yet another shortcut.

479
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:48,963
Claire's Father / Meredith Grey (PVM): Life doesn't work that way, Claire.

480
00:19:49,365 --> 00:19:49,726
Claire's Mother / Meredith Grey (PVM): Tina.

481
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:50,507
Claire's Father / Izzie Stevens (PVM): What?

482
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:51,627
Claire's Mother / Meredith Grey (PVM): You want to argue this?

483
00:19:53,872 --> 00:19:55,212
Claire's Mother / Meredith Grey (PVM): She has so much potential.

484
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,997
Claire's Mother / Meredith Grey OR Meredith Grey (PVM): If she would just apply herself.

485
00:19:57,336 --> 00:19:57,656
Claire Rice: OK.

486
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,804
Doctor: I think we should focus on taking care of your daughter.

487
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:08,338
Doctor: And Claire, your parents agree the best thing to do is to reverse the bypass.

488
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:08,819
Claire Rice: No.

489
00:20:10,403 --> 00:20:11,546
Jamie / Meredith Grey (PVM): No, it's my body.

490
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:15,471
Jamie / Meredith Grey (PVM): I do not want surgery again, please.

491
00:20:15,491 --> 00:20:19,298
Dr. Shepherd / Meredith Grey (PVM): There are serious complications, and this is about your health.

492
00:20:20,102 --> 00:20:21,242
Jamie / Meredith Grey (PVM): But I'd rather be thin.

493
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:23,708
Dr. Shepherd / Meredith Grey (PVM): Well, I'm afraid the choice isn't up to you.

494
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,482
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): It's called Rasmussen's encephalitis.

495
00:20:40,663 --> 00:20:44,169
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): What it amounts to is that this side of her brain, this part's all healthy.

496
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,411
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): It's working perfectly.

497
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:48,733
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): This black part of the brain, his, all of that is dead or dying.

498
00:20:49,634 --> 00:20:53,078
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): The condition has gotten radically worse since her CT scans three months ago.

499
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:56,123
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Left untreated, the disease is going to kill her.

500
00:20:58,144 --> 00:20:58,644
Jamie’s Mother / Meredith Grey (PVM): How soon?

501
00:20:59,728 --> 00:21:00,106
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Too soon.

502
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,432
Jamie’s Mother / Dr. Taylor (PVM): So is there a cure?

503
00:21:04,135 --> 00:21:07,720
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Yeah, the treatment requires the diseased portion of her brain be removed and sealed off.

504
00:21:08,721 --> 00:21:12,825
Dr. Shepherd / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Taylor (PVM): See, eventually, the spinal fluid will fill the cavity.

505
00:21:12,845 --> 00:21:13,884
Jamie’s Mother / Meredith Grey (PVM): Remove what?

506
00:21:13,903 --> 00:21:15,865
Dr. Shepherd / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Taylor (PVM): I mean, that's... Half her brain, yes.

507
00:21:24,894 --> 00:21:25,576
Jamie’s Mother / Meredith Grey (PVM): Half her brain?

508
00:21:25,654 --> 00:21:28,178
Jamie’s Father / Meredith Grey (PVM): That seems impossible.

509
00:21:28,897 --> 00:21:29,979
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Her age makes it possible.

510
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,041
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Her brain's not fully developed, so the remaining neurons will...

511
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,307
Dr. O'Malley / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Compensate for the loss.

512
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:38,089
Jamie’s Mother / Dr. Taylor OR Dr. Taylor (PVM): But will she be normal?

513
00:21:38,111 --> 00:21:39,211
Jamie’s Father / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Is there a risk to any surgery?

514
00:21:39,413 --> 00:21:41,335
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): And this is, you know, a major one.

515
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:47,221
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): But if, you know, we're successful, Jamie could walk out of this hospital in a couple of weeks, go on to live a relatively normal life.

516
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,286
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Look, I know this is a lot to digest, but the important thing to remember is that we can save a life.

517
00:21:51,786 --> 00:21:52,185
George O'Malley / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Thank you.

518
00:21:52,247 --> 00:21:53,708
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Dr. O'Malley.

519
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:54,788
George O'Malley: Yes, what?

520
00:21:55,548 --> 00:22:00,756
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): I'm sorry to bother you, but if the parents consent, I thought you'd like to scrub in on a hemispherectomy.

521
00:22:00,776 --> 00:22:02,317
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Are you in or not?

522
00:22:02,336 --> 00:22:02,576
George O'Malley: Uh, in.

523
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:16,978
George O'Malley: Gang, I'm scrubbing in on a hemispherectomy with Shepard.

524
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:18,160
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): Get out.

525
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,122
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey (PVM): I would kill for that.

526
00:22:19,162 --> 00:22:22,470
Alex Karev / Meredith Grey (PVM): We're going to cut out half the girl's brain, and it's going to work.

527
00:22:23,391 --> 00:22:24,073
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): It's outrageous.

528
00:22:25,576 --> 00:22:27,661
Alex Karev / Meredith Grey (PVM): Almost makes it hard to hate him.

529
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:28,362
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey (PVM): Why do you hate him?

530
00:22:28,761 --> 00:22:30,424
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): Oh, no reason.

531
00:22:30,445 --> 00:22:31,528
Alex Karev / Meredith Grey (PVM): You know about him and Merida?

532
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:33,491
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Taylor (PVM): You know?

533
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:36,240
Dr. Cristina Yang: I'm going to figure out that I know everything.

534
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:36,682
Alex Karev / Meredith Grey (PVM): She knows.

535
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,486
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey (PVM): All about Dr. Sest.

536
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:39,808
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): It's been going on for like ever.

537
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:40,730
George O'Malley / Izzie Stevens (PVM): What?

538
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,634
Alex Karev / Meredith Grey OR Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Cristina Yang OR Izzie Stevens (PVM): And you didn't tell us?

539
00:22:41,973 --> 00:22:43,258
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): Oh, you're a gossip, huh?

540
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:43,837
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey (PVM): I am not.

541
00:22:44,098 --> 00:22:45,000
Dr. Cristina Yang: I am.

542
00:22:45,488 --> 00:22:48,351
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey (PVM): He's about to go into major brain surgery on no sleep.

543
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:49,652
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): Not very responsible.

544
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:50,552
Alex Karev / Meredith Grey (PVM): Shall I smash?

545
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:52,413
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Sex all night isn't about being responsible.

546
00:22:52,615 --> 00:22:53,934
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey (PVM): No, it's about sex all night.

547
00:22:54,217 --> 00:22:56,617
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey (PVM): I can't believe you're not more pissed off about this, you of all people.

548
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:57,960
George O'Malley / Meredith Grey (PVM): She works hard all day.

549
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,020
George O'Malley / Meredith Grey (PVM): She's good at her job.

550
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,541
George O'Malley / Meredith Grey (PVM): Why should you care how she unwinds?

551
00:23:00,883 --> 00:23:02,203
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey (PVM): I mean, you like to bake all night.

552
00:23:02,345 --> 00:23:03,346
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Some people like to drink.

553
00:23:03,404 --> 00:23:05,166
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Others like an occasional screaming orgasm.

554
00:23:05,346 --> 00:23:05,807
Izzie Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): Yeah, we do.

555
00:23:08,431 --> 00:23:09,832
Izzie Stevens / Digby Owens (PVM): Forget I said that.

556
00:23:09,852 --> 00:23:10,531
Izzie Stevens / Digby Owens (PVM): Pretend like I'm not here.

557
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,478
Izzie Stevens / Digby Owens (PVM): You look like you need to be spoon fed.

558
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:17,527
George O'Malley / Meredith Grey (PVM): You look like Alex.

559
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:23,336
George O'Malley / Meredith Grey (PVM): OK, about drinking, Dr. Taylor, the anesthesiologist, do you think he drinks?

560
00:23:24,076 --> 00:23:25,358
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): I said, whatever gets you through the day.

561
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,461
George O'Malley / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Cristina Yang (PVM): No, but I mean here at work.

562
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,144
George O'Malley / Meredith Grey (PVM): Earlier, I thought I smelled.

563
00:23:29,444 --> 00:23:30,067
George O'Malley / Meredith Grey (PVM): You know, do you think?

564
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,529
George O'Malley / Meredith Grey (PVM): I mean, his patients trust the.

565
00:23:34,594 --> 00:23:37,057
George O'Malley / Meredith Grey OR Digby Owens (PVM): So I should say something, right?

566
00:23:37,076 --> 00:23:38,058
Meredith Grey / Digby Owens (PVM): It's a can of worms, George.

567
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,365
George O'Malley / Digby Owens (PVM): And why are we talking about sex, anyway?

568
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:50,435
Digby Owens / Digby Owens (PVM): This is going to leave a pretty sexy scar, huh?

569
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:52,740
Doctor (likely Bailey or Meredith) / Digby Owens (PVM): Don't get any more crazy ideas.

570
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,324
Digby Owens / Digby Owens (PVM): You really think my ideas are crazy?

571
00:23:56,183 --> 00:23:57,026
Doctor (likely Bailey or Meredith) / Digby Owens (PVM): I'm leaning that way.

572
00:23:57,747 --> 00:23:59,067
Digby Owens / Digby Owens (PVM): We wrestle, he plays trumpet.

573
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,012
Patient / Digby Owens (PVM): I feel pretty dizzy.

574
00:24:02,993 --> 00:24:03,776
Meredith Grey / Digby Owens (PVM): You've lost some blood.

575
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,019
Meredith Grey / Digby Owens (PVM): This too shall pass.

576
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:09,124
Unknown / Digby Owens (PVM): Hey.

577
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,817
Alex Karev / Digby Owens (PVM): How come I don't see you down at the mat and bell time?

578
00:24:13,358 --> 00:24:14,361
George O'Malley / Digby Owens (PVM): Oh, man, no time.

579
00:24:14,882 --> 00:24:15,884
Alex Karev / Digby Owens (PVM): Bro, make time.

580
00:24:17,144 --> 00:24:18,207
Alex Karev / Digby Owens (PVM): I'll be expecting you.

581
00:24:19,528 --> 00:24:25,557
George O'Malley / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Digby Owens OR Digby Owens (PVM): Oh, man.

582
00:24:25,576 --> 00:24:26,460
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Handle with care.

583
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,843
Meredith Grey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): This thing's full of gunk, I know.

584
00:24:29,462 --> 00:24:33,430
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): We need to free the bowel from the adhesions caused from the abscess.

585
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,192
Meredith Grey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): This poor girl.

586
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:36,493
Dr. Bailey / George O'Malley (PVM): Cell phone.

587
00:24:36,828 --> 00:24:38,132
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): What was she thinking?

588
00:24:38,152 --> 00:24:39,432
Dr. Bailey / Meredith Grey (PVM): She wants her mother's approval.

589
00:24:40,134 --> 00:24:41,115
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): She wanted to please her.

590
00:24:41,557 --> 00:24:42,877
Dr. Bailey / Meredith Grey (PVM): And this damages the result?

591
00:24:42,979 --> 00:24:45,363
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Meredith Grey (PVM): Here, resect that.

592
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,903
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Needle tip bovie, please.

593
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,589
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): When you're done here, you have post-ops waiting.

594
00:24:51,451 --> 00:24:52,512
Meredith Grey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I know, Dr. Bailey.

595
00:24:52,794 --> 00:24:55,659
Dr. Bailey / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Christina's got the flu, so you need to pick up the slack in the clinic.

596
00:24:55,877 --> 00:24:57,740
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Look, I'm off the floors, OK?

597
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:01,227
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Sorry, that was inappropriate.

598
00:25:01,247 --> 00:25:03,088
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): It's not the only thing that's inappropriate.

599
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:07,483
Meredith Grey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Are we on the subject?

600
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:09,067
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Meredith Grey (PVM): You care to tell me what you think you're doing?

601
00:25:09,086 --> 00:25:11,150
Dr. Taylor / Meredith Grey (PVM): Look, I'll jump through hoops if you want me to.

602
00:25:11,588 --> 00:25:14,134
Dr. Taylor / Meredith Grey (PVM): But what I do when I leave this hospital is my business.

603
00:25:14,493 --> 00:25:16,477
George / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Meredith Grey (PVM): Half this hospital knows your business.

604
00:25:16,497 --> 00:25:18,640
George / Meredith Grey OR Meredith Grey (PVM): Flu isn't the only virus spreading around here.

605
00:25:19,421 --> 00:25:20,162
Dr. Taylor / Meredith Grey (PVM): I made a choice.

606
00:25:20,501 --> 00:25:22,644
Dr. Taylor / Meredith Grey OR Meredith Grey (PVM): And I know you don't respect me for that choice.

607
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:25,048
Dr. Taylor / Meredith Grey (PVM): But I'll live with the consequences.

608
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,791
George / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Meredith Grey (PVM): Then I'll have lots of hoops for you to jump through.

609
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:29,473
Dr. Taylor / Meredith Grey (PVM): I've done everything you've asked me to do.

610
00:25:29,934 --> 00:25:32,038
Dr. Taylor / Meredith Grey (PVM): I may not do it your way, but it gets done.

611
00:25:32,858 --> 00:25:34,883
Dr. Taylor / Meredith Grey (PVM): So whatever else you got, bring it on.

612
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:46,000
Dr. Taylor / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Okay, Dr. Gray, now that you've drained the organ, we can attempt to repair it.

613
00:25:46,923 --> 00:25:48,703
Meredith / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Now my day is perfect.

614
00:25:51,627 --> 00:25:51,949
Unknown (possibly Nurse or Assistant) / Unknown (PVM): Okay, bye.

615
00:25:55,673 --> 00:25:56,413
Meredith / Meredith Grey (PVM): I appreciate this.

616
00:25:56,453 --> 00:26:02,642
Meredith / Meredith Grey (PVM): The chance to scrub in on this kind of procedure is, well, yeah, I appreciate it.

617
00:26:04,006 --> 00:26:04,905
Unknown (possibly Nurse or Assistant) / Dr. Taylor OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Here you go.

618
00:26:04,925 --> 00:26:06,429
Unknown (possibly Nurse or Assistant) / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Triple espresso, not too hot.

619
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:08,351
Dr. Taylor / Dr. Taylor OR Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Oh, I love you.

620
00:26:08,371 --> 00:26:08,671
Dr. Taylor / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Seriously.

621
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:09,471
Dr. Taylor / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Ah, coffee.

622
00:26:09,592 --> 00:26:11,874
Dr. Taylor / Dr. Taylor OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Where would medicine be without it, huh?

623
00:26:11,894 --> 00:26:11,993
Meredith / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Yeah.

624
00:26:12,015 --> 00:26:13,336
Dr. Taylor / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Oh, I hope you have a new crossword, too.

625
00:26:13,355 --> 00:26:14,856
Dr. Taylor / Dr. Taylor OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): I'm going to be here a while.

626
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:15,979
Unknown (possibly Nurse or Assistant) / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Never go without.

627
00:26:16,818 --> 00:26:17,839
Dr. Taylor / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Big day for you, kid.

628
00:26:17,881 --> 00:26:18,381
Dr. Taylor / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Congrats.

629
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,122
JP / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Thanks.

630
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:20,624
Staff Member / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Hey, princess.

631
00:26:21,525 --> 00:26:22,526
Staff Member / Dr. Taylor (PVM): You ready to take a nap?

632
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:24,567
Child Patient / Dr. Cristina Yang OR Dr. Taylor OR Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Izzie Stevens (PVM): Hey, look what I can blow bubbles.

633
00:26:24,586 --> 00:26:24,988
Staff Member / Dr. Taylor OR Dr. Taylor OR Izzie Stevens (PVM): That's it.

634
00:26:25,008 --> 00:26:25,607
Staff Member / Dr. Taylor OR Dr. Taylor (PVM): You just breathe in.

635
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,529
Staff Member / Dr. Taylor OR Dr. Taylor (PVM): Oh, that's it.

636
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:28,570
Child Patient / Izzie Stevens (PVM): What?

637
00:26:28,592 --> 00:26:29,231
Staff Member / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Do you smell?

638
00:26:29,972 --> 00:26:30,232
Child Patient / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Smell what?

639
00:26:30,252 --> 00:26:31,193
Staff Member / Dr. Taylor (PVM): You can't have a mask.

640
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:43,642
Staff Member / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Taylor OR Steph (PVM): I'm sorry, Dr. Taylor, but did you just... Have you been drinking?

641
00:26:45,723 --> 00:26:46,404
Dr. Taylor: I beg your pardon?

642
00:26:47,326 --> 00:26:47,527
Staff Member / Izzie Stevens (PVM): What?

643
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:51,132
Staff Member / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Do you smell... I smell alcohol.

644
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:53,653
Dr. Taylor: Where the hell do you get off accusing me of something like that?

645
00:26:56,177 --> 00:26:57,259
Staff Member / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Taylor (PVM): George, you're out of wine.

646
00:26:58,019 --> 00:26:58,701
Staff Member / Meredith Grey (PVM): There are rules.

647
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,884
Staff Member / Meredith Grey (PVM): You know, there are rules for a reason.

648
00:27:00,943 --> 00:27:01,163
Staff Member / Meredith Grey (PVM): You just...

649
00:27:05,108 --> 00:27:06,813
Staff Member / Meredith Grey (PVM): There is a two-year-old girl on this table.

650
00:27:09,175 --> 00:27:11,622
Athena / Dr. Taylor OR Meredith Grey (PVM): You shouldn't take advantage of someone else's vulnerability.

651
00:27:11,662 --> 00:27:14,307
Dr. Taylor: Look, I don't need some punk intern telling me what's at stake here.

652
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:16,328
Dr. Taylor / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Get him out of here, Shep.

653
00:27:19,895 --> 00:27:20,135
Staff Member / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Shep.

654
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,423
Dr. Derek Shepherd: You're out, George.

655
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:34,387
Staff Member / Dr. Taylor (PVM): You damn well better be ready, Taylor.

656
00:27:34,813 --> 00:27:36,365
Dr. Taylor: I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

657
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,809
Athena / Jamie's Parent (PVM): Do you really seriously want to know why I'm leaving?

658
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:43,893
JP / Jamie's Parent (PVM): Seriously?

659
00:27:44,313 --> 00:27:48,837
Athena / Jamie's Parent OR Jamie's Parent (PVM): How about when you started insisting that I quit my job right when I started to make more money than you?

660
00:27:49,057 --> 00:27:50,942
Athena / Jamie's Parent OR Jamie's Parent (PVM): That should have been the last straw.

661
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:51,520
JP / Jamie's Parent (PVM): No, no.

662
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:59,413
Athena / Jamie's Parent OR Jamie's Parent (PVM): No, the last straw should have been when I found out that those mysterious phone calls that you'd been getting that you kept denying were from other women were really coming from your mother.

663
00:28:00,232 --> 00:28:01,233
JP / Jamie's Parent (PVM): This isn't healthy.

664
00:28:01,295 --> 00:28:02,537
Medical staff (possibly Meredith or nurse) / Meredith Grey OR Jamie's Parent OR Jamie's Parent (PVM): Just hold still, please.

665
00:28:02,557 --> 00:28:03,656
Athena / Meredith Grey OR Jamie's Parent (PVM): Don't you dare try to catch this.

666
00:28:03,938 --> 00:28:05,681
Medical staff (possibly Meredith or Bailey) / Meredith Grey OR Jamie's Parent (PVM): Okay, could the both of you just please stop?

667
00:28:05,921 --> 00:28:07,843
Athena / Meredith Grey OR Steph OR Jamie's Parent OR Jamie's Parent (PVM): You don't love me, JP.

668
00:28:07,863 --> 00:28:08,344
Athena / Jamie's Parent OR Jamie's Parent (PVM): You love to smother me.

669
00:28:08,324 --> 00:28:13,308
Athena / Steph OR Jamie's Parent OR Meredith Grey OR Izzie Stevens OR Jamie's Parent (PVM): And if I could just get you to admit that, then I could leave you with an ounce of respect.

670
00:28:13,588 --> 00:28:17,816
Medical staff (likely Bailey) / Izzie Stevens OR Jamie's Parent (PVM): Hey, Athena, I let you stay in here to keep him calm, so if you're just gonna keep on... Check that.

671
00:28:17,836 --> 00:28:21,880
Athena / Jamie's Parent (PVM): I can't respect a man desperate enough to swallow my exit strategy.

672
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:23,761
Athena / Jamie's Parent (PVM): That is the last straw.

673
00:28:23,843 --> 00:28:25,285
Medical staff (likely Bailey) / Jamie's Parent (PVM): Michelle, can you get her out of here?

674
00:28:25,345 --> 00:28:26,945
Michelle (nurse or orderly) / Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Taylor OR Jamie's Parent (PVM): Ma'am?

675
00:28:28,008 --> 00:28:28,788
Athena / Jamie's Parent (PVM): Fine.

676
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:31,152
Michelle (nurse or orderly) / Dr. Taylor OR Dr. Taylor (PVM): Come on.

677
00:28:31,172 --> 00:28:31,372
Athena / Izzie Stevens (PVM): What?

678
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:34,976
JP / Meredith Grey (PVM): What's happening?

679
00:28:35,415 --> 00:28:36,356
Medical staff (possibly Meredith or Cristina) / Izzie Stevens (PVM): The keys move farther down.

680
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:37,960
Athena / Meredith Grey (PVM): Oh, my God, what does that mean?

681
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:39,701
Medical staff (possibly Meredith or Cristina) / Meredith Grey (PVM): What did you do?

682
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,723
Athena / Meredith Grey (PVM): Don't you dare die, JP.

683
00:28:41,785 --> 00:28:42,306
Medical staff (possibly Meredith or Cristina) / Meredith Grey (PVM): Oh, please.

684
00:28:42,546 --> 00:28:43,586
Medical staff (possibly Meredith or Bailey) / Meredith Grey (PVM): Please, just shut up.

685
00:28:43,748 --> 00:28:44,650
Team Member (likely doctor or nurse) / Meredith Grey (PVM): Just breathe, JP.

686
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:45,852
Another Team Member (doctor or nurse) / Meredith Grey (PVM): Just breathe.

687
00:28:49,198 --> 00:28:49,538
JP / Jamie's Parent (PVM): Got it.

688
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:01,198
Team Member (doctor or nurse) / Meredith Grey OR Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Izzie Stevens (PVM): Very impressive, JP.

689
00:29:01,939 --> 00:29:02,200
Team Member (doctor or nurse) / Meredith Grey OR Izzie Stevens (PVM): You OK?

690
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:02,618
Another Team Member / Meredith Grey OR Izzie Stevens (PVM): Are you OK?

691
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:02,839
JP / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Yeah.

692
00:29:03,221 --> 00:29:04,182
Team Member (doctor or nurse) / Meredith Grey (PVM): You'll be fine.

693
00:29:10,795 --> 00:29:14,063
JP / Jamie's Parent (PVM): You did that on purpose, didn't you?

694
00:29:15,226 --> 00:29:16,386
Team Member (doctor or nurse) / Izzie Stevens (PVM): Can I offer you some advice?

695
00:29:17,852 --> 00:29:21,200
Team Member (doctor or nurse) / Meredith Grey OR Izzie Stevens (PVM): Get in your car and go, for all of our sakes.

696
00:29:23,865 --> 00:29:25,851
JP / Meredith Grey (PVM): You're never gonna find where I parked it.

697
00:29:31,415 --> 00:29:32,396
Team Member (doctor or nurse) / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I need a shower.

698
00:29:32,836 --> 00:29:33,699
Another Team Member / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I need a shower.

699
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:37,343
Team Member (doctor or nurse) / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You need to go tell that girl's parents what kind of kid they're getting back.

700
00:29:37,363 --> 00:29:38,824
Team Member (doctor or nurse) / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You're not going to let me shower first?

701
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,125
Team Member (doctor or nurse) / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): That would be a hoop, would it not?

702
00:29:41,885 --> 00:29:42,886
Another Team Member / Meredith Grey (PVM): It would qualify.

703
00:29:42,927 --> 00:29:45,289
Team Member (doctor or nurse) / Meredith Grey (PVM): Shower first, then.

704
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:50,434
Another Team Member / Meredith Grey OR Izzie Stevens (PVM): Ew, it smells.

705
00:29:50,934 --> 00:29:54,838
Team Member (doctor or nurse) who was in surgery / Meredith Grey (PVM): That would be me, or more specifically, my patient's insides all over me.

706
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,643
Another Team Member / Meredith Grey OR Meredith Grey (PVM): That makes me strangely happy.

707
00:30:01,015 --> 00:30:02,655
Team Member (doctor or nurse) who was in surgery / Meredith Grey (PVM): I smell like karma.

708
00:30:03,297 --> 00:30:03,557
Another Team Member / Izzie Stevens (PVM): What?

709
00:30:04,298 --> 00:30:04,637
Team Member (doctor or nurse) who was in surgery / Meredith Grey (PVM): Nothing.

710
00:30:04,659 --> 00:30:06,621
Another Team Member / Meredith Grey (PVM): Oh, there's something vile stuck in your hair.

711
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:08,363
Team Member (doctor or nurse) who was in surgery / Meredith Grey (PVM): You know, just go stand over there, please.

712
00:30:13,307 --> 00:30:13,406
Another Team Member / Meredith Grey (PVM): Ugh.

713
00:30:13,867 --> 00:30:16,069
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): How much do I love being a surgeon right now?

714
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,394
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey OR Izzie Stevens (PVM): Karma?

715
00:30:18,413 --> 00:30:20,316
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey OR Meredith Grey (PVM): What does karma have to do with anything?

716
00:30:20,816 --> 00:30:26,000
Meredith Grey / Izzie Stevens (PVM): I'm just saying, you've been given all the best surgeries, and now you smell like putrid goo.

717
00:30:26,843 --> 00:30:27,923
Meredith Grey / Izzie Stevens (PVM): And you're giving off a stench.

718
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,065
Cristina Yang / Izzie Stevens (PVM): Karma's a bitch.

719
00:30:30,951 --> 00:30:32,953
Miranda Bailey / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Dr. Shepherd needs an intern in surgery.

720
00:30:32,973 --> 00:30:33,977
Miranda Bailey / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Which one of you is clear to go?

721
00:30:33,997 --> 00:30:34,576
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I'm good, Dr. Bailey.

722
00:30:34,596 --> 00:30:35,419
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Where do you want me?

723
00:30:35,439 --> 00:30:36,681
Miranda Bailey / Meredith Grey (PVM): You need to lie down somewhere.

724
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,060
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): I'm fine.

725
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:38,983
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): I'm completely healthy.

726
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:39,345
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Gray.

727
00:30:40,385 --> 00:30:40,807
Meredith Grey: Of course.

728
00:30:41,729 --> 00:30:42,829
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): What is your problem?

729
00:30:43,192 --> 00:30:44,052
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Um, you.

730
00:30:44,614 --> 00:30:48,759
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey OR Izzie Stevens (PVM): Because apparently you can help Dr. McDreamy in ways the rest of us can't.

731
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:53,326
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You did not just say... Yes, I did.

732
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:54,848
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Hey!

733
00:30:54,868 --> 00:30:57,252
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Hemispherectomy and OR1 with Dr. Shepherd.

734
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:57,733
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Go.

735
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:14,798
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Steph (PVM): Apparently, I'm not the only one with hoops.

736
00:31:14,817 --> 00:31:18,103
Cristina Yang / Digby Owens OR Steph (PVM): If you're gonna get up, you might as well get up.

737
00:31:18,123 --> 00:31:18,522
Miranda Bailey / Digby Owens (PVM): Doctor.

738
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:24,471
Izzie Stevens / Digby Owens OR Digby Owens (PVM): Digby's post-op CBC shows a severe spike in the white blood cell count.

739
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:24,852
Miranda Bailey / Digby Owens (PVM): What is it?

740
00:31:25,432 --> 00:31:27,054
Izzie Stevens / Digby Owens OR Digby Owens (PVM): It's 27 with 16% bands.

741
00:31:27,855 --> 00:31:28,634
Dr. House / Digby Owens (PVM): Something else is wrong.

742
00:31:29,175 --> 00:31:30,557
Dr. Foreman / Digby Owens (PVM): That's a little high for simple stress.

743
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:35,805
Dr. House / Digby Owens (PVM): Check for any other possible sources of infection or recent illness.

744
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:40,954
Dr. Chase / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Taylor (PVM): All right, we're going to start the procedure with the left temporal rectum.

745
00:31:40,976 --> 00:31:43,240
Dr. Chase / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Thanks for joining us, Dr. Yang.

746
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:57,085
Dr. Chase / Dr. Taylor OR Dr. Taylor OR Jamie's Parent (PVM): After the temporal, we'll do the frontal and then the occipital rectum.

747
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:05,121
Dr. Cameron / Meredith Grey (PVM): We were able to reverse the gastric bypass, but we did lose a significant portion of her bowel.

748
00:32:05,442 --> 00:32:08,968
Dr. Cameron / Meredith Grey (PVM): And because of the short gut syndrome, Claire will never eat normally again.

749
00:32:08,988 --> 00:32:09,048
Claire's Parent / Meredith Grey (PVM): OK.

750
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:11,270
Claire's Parent / Izzie Stevens (PVM): What?

751
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:11,751
Claire / Meredith Grey (PVM): Can we?

752
00:32:12,374 --> 00:32:13,375
Claire's Parent / Meredith Grey (PVM): How do we help her here?

753
00:32:14,155 --> 00:32:17,182
Dr. Cameron / Meredith Grey (PVM): Well, getting proper nutrition will be a lifelong problem for Claire.

754
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:17,843
Claire's Parent / Meredith Grey (PVM): Great.

755
00:32:17,863 --> 00:32:19,865
Claire's Parent / Meredith Grey (PVM): As if we already don't have our hands full with her.

756
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,290
Claire / Meredith Grey (PVM): She gets good grades.

757
00:32:23,845 --> 00:32:24,986
Claire / Meredith Grey (PVM): She stays out of trouble.

758
00:32:25,006 --> 00:32:26,326
Claire / Meredith Grey (PVM): She's smart.

759
00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:30,353
Claire's Parent / Meredith Grey (PVM): I just think she feels like nothing she does is good enough for you.

760
00:32:30,373 --> 00:32:33,076
Claire's Parent / Meredith Grey (PVM): If you somehow think that I'm responsible for this.

761
00:32:33,096 --> 00:32:36,660
Claire's Parent / Meredith Grey (PVM): I think Claire is killing herself to please you.

762
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,182
Claire / Meredith Grey (PVM): Please.

763
00:32:41,404 --> 00:32:43,769
Claire's Parent / Meredith Grey (PVM): You have no idea what's going on in that girl's mind.

764
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:44,930
Claire / Meredith Grey (PVM): You're her mother.

765
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,791
Claire / Meredith Grey (PVM): She worships the ground you walk on.

766
00:32:50,096 --> 00:32:51,656
Claire / Meredith Grey (PVM): She didn't do this for herself.

767
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:59,153
Claire's Parent / Meredith Grey OR Izzie Stevens (PVM): I think that this situation is completely ridiculous.

768
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:00,413
Claire / Izzie Stevens (PVM): Shut up.

769
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:09,846
Doctor (possibly Dr. Yang or Dr. Shepherd) / Digby Owens (PVM): What is it?

770
00:33:10,567 --> 00:33:12,067
Dick B. / Digby Owens (PVM): I'm freezing, doc.

771
00:33:12,086 --> 00:33:13,048
Dick B. / Digby Owens (PVM): I can't stop shaking.

772
00:33:13,348 --> 00:33:15,451
Nurse or Intern / Meredith Grey (PVM): His temp's way up and BP's dropping, doctor.

773
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:20,116
Doctor (possibly Dr. Yang or Dr. Shepherd) / Digby Owens (PVM): All right, Dick B. Have you had any recent illnesses, new piercings, tattoos, wounds?

774
00:33:20,557 --> 00:33:21,778
Dick B.: New tat on my calf.

775
00:33:30,483 --> 00:33:32,249
Doctor or Nurse / Digby Owens OR Digby Owens (PVM): Oh, my God.

776
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:33,991
Doctor or Nurse / Digby Owens (PVM): It was nowhere near that nasty this morning.

777
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:34,772
Doctor / Digby Owens (PVM): But it was infected.

778
00:33:35,414 --> 00:33:36,416
Doctor / Digby Owens OR Digby Owens (PVM): Why didn't you say anything?

779
00:33:36,438 --> 00:33:37,117
Dick B.: Ah, it was nothing.

780
00:33:38,741 --> 00:33:40,527
Dick B.: I'm not here to complain about a little pain.

781
00:33:41,347 --> 00:33:44,295
Doctor / Digby Owens OR Digby Owens (PVM): Well, the infection's been exacerbated by the stress in your body from the gunshot.

782
00:33:44,914 --> 00:33:45,778
Doctor / Digby Owens (PVM): Get him to ICU.

783
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,865
Doctor / Digby Owens (PVM): We'll get you started on some antibiotics.

784
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:01,347
Dr. Yang / Dr. Taylor OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): We'll encounter the anterior cerebral artery.

785
00:34:01,808 --> 00:34:08,840
Dr. Shepherd / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Taylor OR Dr. Taylor (PVM): Yes, and we're going to need to... The branches of the artery need to be coagulated and divided.

786
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,402
Dr. Yang / Dr. Taylor (PVM): You know, Taylor, her anesthesia is awful light.

787
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:15,268
Dr. Yang / Dr. Taylor OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Come on, Taylor.

788
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:16,411
Dr. Yang / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): She's waking up.

789
00:34:20,498 --> 00:34:21,059
Dr. Yang or Dr. Shepherd / Meredith Grey (PVM): Dr. Taylor.

790
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:23,282
Dr. Yang or Dr. Shepherd / Meredith Grey (PVM): He's asleep.

791
00:34:24,864 --> 00:34:25,364
Dr. Yang or Dr. Shepherd / Meredith Grey (PVM): Taylor!

792
00:34:34,862 --> 00:34:35,884
Dr. Yang or Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor OR Digby Owens OR Izzie Stevens (PVM): Dr. Taylor!

793
00:34:37,364 --> 00:34:38,045
Dr. Taylor / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Oh, god.

794
00:34:38,065 --> 00:34:38,346
Dr. Taylor / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Sorry.

795
00:34:38,425 --> 00:34:38,726
Dr. Taylor / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Sorry.

796
00:34:38,907 --> 00:34:39,246
Dr. Taylor / Dr. Taylor (PVM): I'm on it.

797
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:44,152
George / Dr. Taylor OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): My bad, Chuck.

798
00:34:44,172 --> 00:34:44,811
Dr. Taylor / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): He was right, wasn't he?

799
00:34:46,514 --> 00:34:47,275
Dr. Taylor / Dr. Taylor (PVM): I nodded off.

800
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:47,695
George / Dr. Taylor OR Dr. Taylor (PVM): Come on.

801
00:34:47,715 --> 00:34:49,277
Dr. Taylor / Dr. Taylor OR Dr. Taylor (PVM): Yeah, whatever you got to do to get through the day, all right?

802
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:50,538
Dr. Taylor: Steph, get me some coffee.

803
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:51,318
Steph: Yes, doctor.

804
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:52,920
Dr. Taylor / Dr. Taylor (PVM): I'll be fine.

805
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,701
Dr. Taylor / Dr. Taylor (PVM): It won't happen again.

806
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:55,782
Dr. Taylor / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Yeah, not in here it won't.

807
00:34:55,902 --> 00:34:57,244
Dr. Taylor: Steph, call Dr. Pennington.

808
00:34:57,844 --> 00:34:59,405
Dr. Taylor: Hopkins, take over until she gets here.

809
00:35:00,007 --> 00:35:01,208
Dr. Taylor / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Get out of here and get it together.

810
00:35:09,034 --> 00:35:09,755
George / Digby Owens (PVM): What happened?

811
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:12,900
Hopkins / Dr. Taylor OR Digby Owens (PVM): He went into multisystem organ failure, secondary to overwhelming sepsis.

812
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,043
Hopkins / Digby Owens (PVM): Now he's all.

813
00:35:14,483 --> 00:35:16,688
Steph / Digby Owens (PVM): If it fixes his BP, that should help his mental status.

814
00:35:17,228 --> 00:35:19,331
Hopkins / Digby Owens OR Dr. Taylor (PVM): He's maxed out on presto.

815
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:20,052
Steph / Digby Owens OR Dr. Taylor (PVM): We got V-tach.

816
00:35:21,114 --> 00:35:21,815
Hopkins / Digby Owens (PVM): He's looking bad.

817
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:25,282
Hopkins / Digby Owens OR Digby Owens (PVM): Put the D-fib pads on him and give him 150 on amiodarone.

818
00:35:27,905 --> 00:35:28,007
Steph / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Yeah.

819
00:35:28,027 --> 00:35:29,088
Steph / Digby Owens (PVM): I lost his pulse.

820
00:35:29,108 --> 00:35:29,909
Hopkins / Digby Owens (PVM): D-fib, get the pads.

821
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:32,994
Hopkins / Meredith Grey OR Digby Owens OR Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Digby Owens (PVM): Get the paddles in charge of 200.

822
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:33,135
Hopkins / Meredith Grey OR Digby Owens OR Digby Owens (PVM): Clear.

823
00:35:40,625 --> 00:36:03,239
Dr. Taylor / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Taylor OR Digby Owens (PVM): This packing we hope will, uh...

824
00:36:03,893 --> 00:36:04,856
Dr. Taylor / Dr. Taylor (PVM): prevent hemorrhaging.

825
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:06,697
Dr. Shepherd / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Taylor (PVM): Dr. Yang, do you want to add something to that?

826
00:36:06,717 --> 00:36:09,641
Dr. Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): We'll allow the cerebral spinal fluid to eventually fill the cavity.

827
00:36:10,442 --> 00:36:11,202
Dr. Shepherd / Meredith Grey (PVM): Very nice.

828
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:12,364
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): You two, you want to close up?

829
00:36:12,744 --> 00:36:13,987
Dr. Karev / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Taylor (PVM): Yes, Doc.

830
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:14,567
Meredith Grey / Dr. Taylor (PVM): I'm going to go to bed.

831
00:36:16,168 --> 00:36:17,791
Dr. Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): That was unreal.

832
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:20,313
Dr. Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): I mean, that's all there is.

833
00:36:20,454 --> 00:36:23,416
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): I was feeling sick until I came here.

834
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:24,398
Meredith Grey / Dr. Taylor (PVM): I was tired.

835
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,221
Meredith Grey / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Now I'm tired again.

836
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:28,003
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Taylor (PVM): It's back to reality.

837
00:36:29,324 --> 00:36:32,788
Dr. Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): So forget about your troubles

838
00:36:36,025 --> 00:36:36,726
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Let me explain.

839
00:36:36,746 --> 00:36:37,146
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Taylor (PVM): It's fine.

840
00:36:37,266 --> 00:36:38,550
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): No, there is a code among doctors.

841
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,572
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): We're not supposed to ask each other questions.

842
00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:42,657
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Not within the walls of this hospital.

843
00:36:42,898 --> 00:36:43,960
Dr. Bailey / Jamie's Parent (PVM): Okay, I was out of line.

844
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:44,721
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): No, you weren't.

845
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:45,242
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Taylor (PVM): I was.

846
00:36:46,925 --> 00:36:47,646
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Taylor (PVM): I was out of line.

847
00:36:48,869 --> 00:36:52,456
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Somebody should have taken responsibility, and it should have been the guy doing the cutting.

848
00:36:52,576 --> 00:36:53,277
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Taylor (PVM): It should have been me.

849
00:36:54,518 --> 00:36:55,942
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): You didn't deserve what happened to you today.

850
00:36:56,523 --> 00:36:57,344
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): You did the right thing.

851
00:36:57,744 --> 00:36:58,606
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Code or no code.

852
00:37:08,695 --> 00:37:10,697
Meredith Grey / Dr. Taylor (PVM): You saw me leave the house this morning, didn't you?

853
00:37:11,739 --> 00:37:12,378
Claire / Jamie's Parent (PVM): Oh, is that you?

854
00:37:12,418 --> 00:37:17,304
Doctor / Dr. Taylor OR Jamie's Parent (PVM): I'm not using her.

855
00:37:18,827 --> 00:37:19,967
Doctor / Dr. Taylor (PVM): And I don't favor her.

856
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,632
Claire / George O'Malley (PVM): She's pretty great, you know.

857
00:37:26,576 --> 00:37:26,815
Doctor / Unknown (PVM): Mm-hmm.

858
00:37:26,835 --> 00:37:26,936
Claire / Dr. Taylor (PVM): Yeah.

859
00:37:26,956 --> 00:37:30,400
Doctor / Dr. Taylor (PVM): So come on, let's go tell Jamie's parents she's going to be fine, barring any complications.

860
00:37:34,396 --> 00:37:35,416
Claire / Meredith Grey (PVM): Did you fix me?

861
00:37:36,157 --> 00:37:38,141
Doctor / Meredith Grey (PVM): No, not completely.

862
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:41,907
Claire / Meredith Grey (PVM): So I won't get fat?

863
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:42,166
Doctor / Meredith Grey (PVM): No.

864
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:47,014
Claire / Meredith Grey OR Meredith Grey (PVM): Oh, that's awesome.

865
00:37:47,034 --> 00:37:50,378
Doctor / Meredith Grey (PVM): Claire, I've asked social services to contact your parents.

866
00:37:51,981 --> 00:37:52,481
Claire / Meredith Grey (PVM): Why?

867
00:37:53,103 --> 00:37:55,105
Doctor / Meredith Grey (PVM): They can help you.

868
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:58,831
Claire / Meredith Grey (PVM): With what?

869
00:37:58,851 --> 00:38:03,356
Doctor / Meredith Grey (PVM): You don't know this yet, but life isn't supposed to be like this.

870
00:38:04,972 --> 00:38:06,514
Doctor / Meredith Grey (PVM): It's not supposed to be this hard.

871
00:38:06,936 --> 00:38:13,905
Narrator / Digby Owens OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Well, don't worry with your suitcase, dear.

872
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:15,005
