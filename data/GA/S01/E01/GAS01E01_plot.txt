A character narrates about 'the game' of surgery, stating that people either have what it takes or they don't. The narrator mentions their mother was one of the greats, but feels personally unprepared. In a house, two people wake up together after what appears to be a one-night stand. One character finds the situation humiliating. The other insists the first must leave because they are late for their first day of work. They discuss whether one of them lives there; it is revealed that the house belonged to the second character's mother and is being sold. The second character clarifies their mother is not dead. They agree not to exchange personal details. As the second character goes to shower, the first is told to be gone when they return. Before leaving, the names 'Derek' and 'Meredith' are exchanged. Both characters are present. A group of new surgical interns gathers at a hospital. An authoritative figure addresses them, explaining that they are now doctors, not students, and that their residency will be both the best and worst time of their lives. The speaker warns that many will not make it through the program. The narrator again expresses self-doubt. In a hospital corridor, several interns, including Christina, George, and others, discuss the gender ratio among the new interns and rumors about one being a model. They talk about which resident they are assigned to, referring to one as 'the Nazi.' George introduces himself, referencing a previous meeting with a female intern. The group is called to attention as names are read off. A female resident, later identified as Dr. Bailey, introduces herself to the group of interns and lays out five strict rules for their conduct, including not waking her unless a patient is dying and always running to answer pages. She makes it clear she dislikes them and expects them to memorize her rules. The group responds affirmatively. A medical emergency is called: a 15-year-old girl named Katie Bryce is brought in with seizures. Dr. Bailey and Dr. Burke are present, along with several interns including Izzy, Christina, George, and Meredith. Orders are given for medication and tests. Meredith is assigned responsibility for Katie and told to take her for a CT scan. Izzy is assigned to perform rectal exams. In a hospital area, Dr. Bailey is approached by an intern (likely Christina) who reports that Katie Bryce's labs are clear. The intern mentions a rumor that the best intern will be allowed to perform a procedure on the first shift. Dr. Bailey dismisses the intern. In a patient room, an intern (likely Izzy) talks with a patient about missing bacon after surgery. Another intern (likely George) is told he is lost, but he denies it. The patient, Katie Bryce, complains about missing her pageant and discusses her talent, rhythmic gymnastics. Izzy prepares to perform a rectal exam on Katie. In a break area, several interns discuss their difficulties. One complains about performing 17 rectal exams and feeling disliked by Dr. Bailey. The group gossips about Meredith, revealing her mother is Ellis Gray, a famous surgeon. They express envy and discuss the pressure of living up to such a legacy. Katie Bryce is described as a difficult patient. Dr. Burke gathers the interns and announces that the honor of performing the first surgery goes to George O'Malley, who will scrub in for an appendectomy. George is surprised and congratulated. Two doctors discuss George O'Malley's selection for surgery. One doubts George's abilities, noting he barely made the cut for the program. The other insists on choosing George, suggesting it is a tradition to pick one intern to 'terrorize' so the others fall in line. Katie Bryce's status is briefly updated. Katie Bryce's parents arrive and ask about her condition. An intern (likely Meredith) is unable to answer their questions and goes to find the attending doctor. Dr. Shepherd is identified as the new attending on Katie's case. Meredith approaches Dr. Shepherd, who is revealed to be the same Derek from the earlier scene. They awkwardly discuss their previous encounter and agree to keep it secret. Meredith insists their relationship must remain professional now that he is her attending. In the operating gallery, a group of interns watches George O'Malley's surgery. They place bets on whether he will succeed or fail. George begins the appendectomy under supervision. He successfully removes the appendix but then makes a mistake, causing a complication. Dr. Burke takes over, and George is removed from the OR. The other interns refer to George as '007,' meaning 'license to kill.' George, distressed, asks other interns if people are calling him 007. They deny it, but he suspects otherwise. A code is called for Katie Bryce, and the interns rush away. In a hospital corridor, an intern laments that surgery is a tough specialty and jokes about geriatrics being easier. The intern expresses a desire to move out of their mother's house. An intern arrives at Katie Bryce's room after a 911 page, only to find Katie is fine but bored and wants to watch her pageant on TV. The intern is frustrated and tells Katie to go to sleep. An intern (likely Meredith) asks another intern for help starting a central line on a patient with difficult veins. The intern admits never having done one before. They consider asking Dr. Bailey for help. The intern approaches Dr. Bailey, who is sleeping, to ask for help with a central line. Dr. Bailey is annoyed and tells the intern not to wake her unless the patient is near death. In a patient care area, an intern suggests starting antibiotics for a patient with post-op pneumonia. A nurse questions the diagnosis, suggesting alternative possibilities. The intern is dismissive. Another intern, Alex, introduces himself and makes a derogatory comment about nurses. The group discusses another intern, Katie, and relationships. Katie Bryce begins having multiple grand mal seizures. Dr. Bailey asks Meredith how to proceed. Meredith gives medication orders but the seizures continue. Dr. Bailey and the team attempt various interventions, including phenobarbital. Katie's heart stops, and the team performs resuscitation. After several attempts, Katie's heart rhythm returns. Dr. Bailey reprimands the team for not paging her immediately. Katie's parents confront Dr. Shepherd about their daughter's condition, frustrated by the lack of answers. Dr. Shepherd assures them he is working hard but cannot yet provide a diagnosis. The parents demand another doctor. Dr. Burke discusses an upcoming bypass surgery with a patient named Mr. Savage and his wife, Gloria. He explains the procedure and risks. An intern reassures Gloria, promising her husband will be fine. Dr. Burke admonishes the intern for making promises to patients' families. In a break room, Meredith is suturing a banana to stay awake. Christina confronts her about getting to scrub in on Katie's surgery. Meredith apologizes for being mean when tired. Dr. Shepherd enters and asks the interns for help diagnosing Katie Bryce, explaining her condition is a mystery. He offers the incentive that whoever finds the answer can scrub in on the surgery. An intern pages Dr. Bailey about the patient in 4B, who is still short of breath. Dr. Bailey dismisses the concern, attributing it to the patient's age and tells the intern not to page her again. Christina approaches Meredith and proposes working together to solve Katie's case, offering Meredith the chance to scrub in if they succeed. Meredith agrees. They review Katie's symptoms and rule out various causes. Meredith reveals to Christina that she had sex with Dr. Shepherd. Christina asks if it was good. They continue brainstorming possible diagnoses. Christina and Meredith discuss the implications if no one can diagnose Katie and she dies. They reflect on Katie's life and her pageant talent, rhythmic gymnastics. Meredith suddenly has an idea related to Katie's fall during pageant practice. Meredith and Christina approach Dr. Shepherd with their theory that Katie's seizures are due to a subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a minor fall during rhythmic gymnastics. Dr. Shepherd is initially skeptical but orders further investigation. Dr. Shepherd and the interns confirm that Katie has a minute subarachnoid hemorrhage. Dr. Shepherd praises Meredith and Christina for their work and tells Meredith she will scrub in on the surgery. Christina is disappointed about not being chosen for the surgery. Meredith reflects on the competitive nature of the program and the unpredictability of outcomes. Dr. Burke informs Gloria that her husband, Tony, died during surgery due to extensive heart damage. Gloria is devastated. Dr. Burke tells the intern who promised Gloria a good outcome that only God can make such promises and instructs the intern to deliver the bad news. Christina confronts Meredith about being chosen for the surgery, accusing her of getting ahead because of her relationship with Dr. Shepherd and her famous mother. Meredith insists she earned her place. Christina tells her to deal with the consequences of her actions. The intern delivers the news to Gloria that Tony has died. Gloria is distraught and asks for privacy. In a hospital room, Meredith helps prepare Katie Bryce for surgery, promising to make her look 'cool' despite having to shave her head. Meredith asks Dr. Shepherd if she was chosen for the surgery because they slept together. Dr. Shepherd jokes but assures her she earned it. He encourages her not to let their personal history interfere with her opportunity. In a quiet moment, George and another intern discuss their doubts about being surgeons. George reflects on his parents' pride and his own insecurities. Meredith shares that her mother tried to talk her out of medical school. They agree that being seen as a 'superhero' sounds good and hope they will survive the program. A senior doctor quizzes an intern about a patient with post-op fever. The intern struggles to answer. Another intern correctly lists the five Ws of post-op fever and suggests the patient may have a pulmonary embolus. The senior doctor instructs the team to follow the correct diagnostic steps and requests the intern be removed from the case. The senior doctor recognizes Meredith as Ellis Gray's daughter and welcomes her. Dr. Shepherd gathers the surgical team and declares it a 'beautiful night to save lives.' He encourages the team to have fun. Meredith narrates about the challenges of being a surgeon and the reasons to quit, but concludes that she loves the work. In a break area, Meredith and Christina agree not to have an emotional conversation. Christina tells Meredith to get some sleep, and they exchange banter about who looks worse. After surgery, an intern expresses amazement at the experience, describing it as a high better than drugs. Another intern agrees. One says they should go do something, and the other encourages them. They part ways, saying 'see you around.' Meredith narrates that she and the other interns survived their first shift. She reflects that the other interns are good people and decides not to sell her mother's house, planning to get roommates instead. Meredith visits her mother, who is in a care facility and does not recognize her. Meredith introduces herself. Her mother, Ellis, vaguely recalls being a doctor. Meredith confirms that her mother was a surgeon.
