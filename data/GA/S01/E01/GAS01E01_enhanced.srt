1
00:00:03,952 --> 00:00:04,950
NARRATOR (LLM_UNCERTAIN): The game -

2
00:00:05,942 --> 00:00:09,683
NARRATOR (LLM_UNCERTAIN): they say a person either has what it takes to play or they don't.

3
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:13,160
NARRATOR (LLM_UNCERTAIN): My mother was one of the greats.

4
00:00:13,974 --> 00:00:15,410
NARRATOR (LLM_UNCERTAIN): Me, on the other hand -

5
00:00:15,746 --> 00:00:17,605
NARRATOR (LLM_UNCERTAIN): I'm kind of screwed.

6
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:39,551
DR. MEREDITH GREY (DB_VALIDATED, original: MEREDITH): This is, uh...

7
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:41,875
DR. MEREDITH GREY (DB_VALIDATED, original: MEREDITH): Humiliating on so many levels.

8
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:42,868
DR. MEREDITH GREY: You have to go.

9
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,996
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: Why don't you just come back down here, and we'll pick up where we left off?

10
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:48,209
DR. MEREDITH GREY: No, seriously. You have to go. I'm late,

11
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:50,987
DR. MEREDITH GREY: which isn't what you want to be on  your first day of work, so...

12
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:53,652
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: So, uh, you actually live here.

13
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:54,610
DR. MEREDITH GREY: No.

14
00:00:55,616 --> 00:00:57,536
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Yes, kind of.

15
00:01:00,762 --> 00:01:02,790
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: It's nice - a little dusty -

16
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:04,453
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: odd, but it's nice.

17
00:01:05,852 --> 00:01:07,153
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: So, how do you kind of live here?

18
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:11,259
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I moved two weeks ago from Boston.  It was my mother's house. I'm selling it.

19
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:12,246
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: Oh, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:13,751
DR. MEREDITH GREY: For what?

21
00:01:14,146 --> 00:01:15,254
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: You said "was."

22
00:01:15,396 --> 00:01:17,954
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Oh, my mother's not dead. She's -

23
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:19,923
DR. MEREDITH GREY: You know what? We don't have to do the thing.

24
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,200
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: Oh, we can do anything you want.

25
00:01:22,385 --> 00:01:25,504
DR. MEREDITH GREY: No, the thing - exchange the details, pretend we care.

26
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,843
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I'm gonna go upstairs and take a shower, okay?

27
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:31,635
DR. MEREDITH GREY: And when I get back down here, you won't be here, so, um...

28
00:01:32,328 --> 00:01:35,281
DR. MEREDITH GREY: goodbye, um...

29
00:01:37,817 --> 00:01:38,722
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: Derek.

30
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:40,894
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Derek. Right. Meredith.

31
00:01:40,974 --> 00:01:41,591
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: Meredith.

32
00:01:41,662 --> 00:01:43,526
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Yeah. Mm-hmm.

33
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:45,598
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: - Nice meeting you. - Bye, Derek.

34
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:08,287
DR. RICHARD WEBBER (LLM_UNCERTAIN): Each of you comes here today hopeful,

35
00:02:08,402 --> 00:02:09,925
DR. RICHARD WEBBER: wanting in on the game.

36
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:13,568
DR. RICHARD WEBBER (LLM_UNCERTAIN): A month ago, you were in med school,  being taught by doctors.

37
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:15,793
DR. RICHARD WEBBER (LLM_UNCERTAIN): Today...

38
00:02:16,713 --> 00:02:18,399
DR. RICHARD WEBBER (LLM_UNCERTAIN): you are the doctors.

39
00:02:20,844 --> 00:02:23,034
DR. RICHARD WEBBER: The 7 years you spend here as a surgical resident

40
00:02:23,048 --> 00:02:25,248
DR. RICHARD WEBBER: will be the best and worst of your life.

41
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,301
DR. RICHARD WEBBER (LLM_UNCERTAIN): You will be pushed to the breaking point.

42
00:02:28,038 --> 00:02:29,016
DR. RICHARD WEBBER (LLM_UNCERTAIN): Look around you.

43
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,962
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Say hello to your competition.

44
00:02:31,836 --> 00:02:34,509
DR. RICHARD WEBBER: Eight of you will switch to an easier specialty.

45
00:02:34,584 --> 00:02:36,451
DR. RICHARD WEBBER (LLM_UNCERTAIN): Five of you will crack under the pressure.

46
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:38,173
DR. RICHARD WEBBER: Two of you will be asked to leave.

47
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:40,286
DR. RICHARD WEBBER: This is your starting line.

48
00:02:40,562 --> 00:02:42,109
DR. RICHARD WEBBER (LLM_UNCERTAIN): This is your arena.

49
00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:44,094
DR. RICHARD WEBBER: How well you play...

50
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:47,223
DR. RICHARD WEBBER: that's up to you.

51
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:49,701
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Like I said...

52
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:52,163
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I'm screwed.

53
00:03:03,453 --> 00:03:07,086
UNIDENTIFIED RESIDENT OR STAFF (LLM_UNCERTAIN): Okay, Martin, Robinson, Bond, Hawkins.

54
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:13,139
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Only 6 women out of 20.

55
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:15,465
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Yeah. I hear one of them's a model.

56
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:18,521
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Seriously, that's gonna help  with the respect thing?

57
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:21,695
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: - You're Cristina, right? - Patton, Monroe...

58
00:03:23,307 --> 00:03:25,135
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Which resident are you assigned to?  I got bailey.

59
00:03:25,308 --> 00:03:26,850
DR. MEREDITH GREY (DB_VALIDATED, original: MEREDITH GREY): The Nazi? Me too.

60
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:28,818
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: You got the Nazi? So did I.

61
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,723
DR. MEREDITH GREY: At least we'll be tortured together, right?

62
00:03:31,281 --> 00:03:33,497
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: I'm George O’Malley.

63
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:37,274
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Uh, we met at the mixer. You had on a black dress

64
00:03:37,287 --> 00:03:40,981
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: with a slit up the side, strappy sandals...

65
00:03:42,864 --> 00:03:45,365
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Now you think I'm gay. No, I'm not gay.

66
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:50,725
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: It's - it's just that you were - you  were very unforgettable.

67
00:03:50,884 --> 00:03:53,783
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: O’Malley, Yang, Grey, Stevens.

68
00:03:54,574 --> 00:03:56,174
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: And I'm totally forgettable.

69
00:03:57,358 --> 00:03:58,888
DR. CRISTINA YANG: - Bailey? - End of the hall.

70
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:01,847
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: That's the Nazi?

71
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,022
DR. ISOBEL STEVENS (DB_VALIDATED, original: IZZIE STEVENS): I thought the Nazi would be a guy.

72
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,306
DR. CRISTINA YANG: I thought the Nazi would be a Nazi.

73
00:04:07,424 --> 00:04:09,076
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Maybe it's professional jealousy.

74
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:12,221
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Maybe she's brilliant, and they call her a Nazi because they're jealous.

75
00:04:12,421 --> 00:04:13,362
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Maybe she's nice.

76
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:14,913
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Let me guess - you're the model.

77
00:04:16,106 --> 00:04:18,995
DR. ISOBEL STEVENS: Hi, I'm Isobel Stevens, but everyone calls me "Izzie."

78
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,043
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: I have five rules. Memorize them.

79
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:26,870
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Rule number one - don't bother sucking up.  I already hate you. That's not gonna change.

80
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:31,324
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Trauma protocol, phone list, pagers - nurses will page you.

81
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:35,752
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: You will answer every page at a run -  a run - that's rule number two.

82
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:39,500
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Your first shift starts now and  lasts 48 hours.

83
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:43,903
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: You're interns, grunts, nobodies, bottom of the surgical food chain.

84
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:48,173
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: You run labs, write orders, work every second night until you drop, and don't complain.

85
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,124
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: On-call rooms - attendings hog them.

86
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:53,850
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Sleep when you can where you can, which brings me to rule number three.

87
00:04:53,913 --> 00:04:57,994
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: If I'm sleeping, don't wake me unless your patient is actually dying.

88
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,790
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Rule number four - the dying patient better not be dead when I get there.

89
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:04,732
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Not only will you have killed someone, you would have woke me for no good reason. We clear?

90
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:05,997
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Yes?

91
00:05:06,093 --> 00:05:08,716
DR. MEREDITH GREY: You said five rules. That was only four.

92
00:05:09,774 --> 00:05:12,346
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Rule number five - when I move, you move.

93
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:15,134
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Get out of my way!

94
00:05:30,382 --> 00:05:31,161
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: What do we got?

95
00:05:31,244 --> 00:05:36,103
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Katie Bryce, 15-year-old female, new onset seizures, intermittent for the past week.

96
00:05:36,178 --> 00:05:39,850
PARAMEDIC (LLM_UNCERTAIN): I.V. lost en route, started grand mal seizing as we descended.

97
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:41,350
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY (DB_VALIDATED, original: DR. BAILEY): All right, get her on her side.

98
00:05:42,062 --> 00:05:44,526
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Izzie, 10 milligrams diazepam I.M.

99
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:47,505
DR. MEREDITH GREY: No, no. The white lead is on the right.

100
00:05:47,572 --> 00:05:49,644
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Righty, whity - smoke over fire.

101
00:05:49,768 --> 00:05:52,819
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: A large-bore I.V. Don't let the blood hemolyze. Let's go!

102
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:00,177
DR. MEREDITH GREY: What do we have? A wet fish on dry land.

103
00:06:00,238 --> 00:06:01,872
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Absolutely, Dr. Burke.

104
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:05,415
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Dr. Bailey, let's shotgun her.

105
00:06:05,497 --> 00:06:09,593
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY (DB_VALIDATED, original: DR. BAILEY): That means every test in the book - C.T., CBC, chem-7, tox screen.

106
00:06:09,654 --> 00:06:12,706
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Cristina, you're on labs. George, patient work-ups.

107
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:14,769
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Meredith, get Katie for a C.T.

108
00:06:14,862 --> 00:06:16,930
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: She's your responsibility now.

109
00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:18,435
DR. ISOBEL STEVENS: Wait. What about me?

110
00:06:20,057 --> 00:06:22,317
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Honey, you get to do rectal exams.

111
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:39,350
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY (LLM_UNCERTAIN): What are you doing here?

112
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,119
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Katie Bryce's labs came out clear. There's nothing

113
00:06:42,132 --> 00:06:44,132
DR. CRISTINA YANG: in the results that explain her seizures.

114
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:45,911
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: - I just thought you wanna know. - Okay.

115
00:06:46,192 --> 00:06:50,149
DR. CRISTINA YANG: I heard every year, the attending on call picks the best intern

116
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,005
DR. CRISTINA YANG: and lets them perform a procedure during the first shift.

117
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:57,803
DR. CRISTINA YANG: I'm just saying it's what I heard.

118
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,031
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Go away... now.

119
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:02,653
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Yeah, sounds good.

120
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:03,564
MR. TONY SAVITCH: He'll be fine?

121
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:04,478
DR. ISOBEL STEVENS (DB_VALIDATED, original: IZZIE STEVENS): You'll be fine.

122
00:07:04,603 --> 00:07:07,596
MR. TONY SAVITCH: If you don't count the fact that my bacon days are over, sure.

123
00:07:07,696 --> 00:07:10,644
DR. ISOBEL STEVENS (DB_VALIDATED, original: IZZIE STEVENS): So, bypass surgery tomorrow with Dr. Burke - I hear he's good.

124
00:07:10,716 --> 00:07:14,581
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: And, after that, you can have all the bacon-flavored soy product you can eat.

125
00:07:14,653 --> 00:07:16,112
MR. TONY SAVITCH: Mmm. Kill me now.

126
00:07:16,225 --> 00:07:19,055
DR. ISOBEL STEVENS (DB_VALIDATED, original: IZZIE STEVENS): I wish I could, but I'm a healer.

127
00:07:22,144 --> 00:07:23,148
NURSE (LLM_UNCERTAIN): You're lost.

128
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:25,723
DR. MEREDITH GREY (DB_VALIDATED, original: MEREDITH GREY): I'm not lost.

129
00:07:25,826 --> 00:07:26,870
DR. MEREDITH GREY (DB_VALIDATED, original: MEREDITH GREY): How are you feeling?

130
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,512
KATIE BRYCE: How do you think I'm feeling?

131
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,007
KATIE BRYCE: I'm missing my pageant.

132
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:31,329
DR. MEREDITH GREY (DB_VALIDATED, original: MEREDITH GREY): You're missing your pageant?

133
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:33,007
KATIE BRYCE: The Spokane teen miss.

134
00:07:33,101 --> 00:07:35,721
KATIE BRYCE: I was in the top 10 after the first 2 rounds.

135
00:07:35,814 --> 00:07:37,033
KATIE BRYCE: This is my year.

136
00:07:37,134 --> 00:07:38,235
KATIE BRYCE: I could have won.

137
00:07:38,855 --> 00:07:39,711
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY (DB_VALIDATED, original: GEORGE O'MALLEY): Hello.

138
00:07:40,612 --> 00:07:43,058
KATIE BRYCE: You're so lost. What are you, like, new?

139
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:49,899
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Okay, so I'm just gonna insert my fingers into your rectum.

140
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:57,759
PATIENT (RECTAL EXAM): No.

141
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:01,552
PATIENT (RECTAL EXAM): Out.

142
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:03,074
ANOTHER PATIENT OR NURSE: Out.

143
00:08:05,182 --> 00:08:07,271
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Bet you missed a lot when you first started out.

144
00:08:10,754 --> 00:08:12,668
KATIE BRYCE: I twisted my ankle in talent rehearsal.

145
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,757
KATIE BRYCE: I do rhythmic gymnastics, which is, like, really cool.

146
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:16,949
KATIE BRYCE: Nobody else does it.

147
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,567
KATIE BRYCE: And I tripped over my ribbon. And I didn't get stuck with someone this clueless,

148
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:24,271
KATIE BRYCE: and that was, like, a nurse.

149
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:26,841
KATIE BRYCE: You and I are gonna have so much fun together.

150
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:36,999
DR. CRISTINA YANG: This shift is a marathon, not a sprint. Eat.

151
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:37,894
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: I can't.

152
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,000
DR. ISOBEL STEVENS (DB_VALIDATED, original: IZZIE STEVENS): You should eat something.

153
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:43,246
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY (DB_VALIDATED, original: GEORGE O'MALLEY): You try eating after performing 17 rectal exams. The Nazi hates me.

154
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:46,265
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: The Nazi’s a resident. I have attendings hating me.

155
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:47,767
DR. CRISTINA YANG: You know Meredith is inbred?

156
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:50,341
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Like it's uncommon around here to be a doctors' parents -

157
00:08:50,403 --> 00:08:52,554
DR. CRISTINA YANG: No, royally inbred - her mother is Ellis Grey.

158
00:08:52,596 --> 00:08:53,755
DR. ISOBEL STEVENS: Shut up. The Ellis Grey?

159
00:08:54,043 --> 00:08:54,852
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY (DB_VALIDATED, original: GEORGE O'MALLEY): Who's Ellis Grey?

160
00:08:55,855 --> 00:08:58,355
DR. CRISTINA YANG (DB_VALIDATED, original: CRISTINA YANG): The Grey Method. Where'd you go to med school - Mexico?

161
00:08:58,447 --> 00:09:01,057
DR. ISOBEL STEVENS (DB_VALIDATED, original: IZZIE STEVENS): She was one of the first big chick surgeons.

162
00:09:01,203 --> 00:09:04,028
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY (DB_VALIDATED, original: GEORGE O'MALLEY): She's a living legend. Yeah, she won the harper Avery twice.

163
00:09:04,105 --> 00:09:05,568
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY (DB_VALIDATED, original: GEORGE O'MALLEY): So I didn't know one thing.

164
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:07,028
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Talk about parental pressure.

165
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:09,179
DR. CRISTINA YANG: God, I would kill to have Ellis Grey as a mother.

166
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:11,032
DR. CRISTINA YANG: I'd kill to be Ellis Grey.

167
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,639
DR. MEREDITH GREY: All I need is one good case.

168
00:09:14,157 --> 00:09:16,577
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Katie Bryce is a pain in the ass.

169
00:09:16,658 --> 00:09:20,395
DR. MEREDITH GREY: If I hadn't taken the hippocratic oath, I'd Kevorkian her with my bare hands.

170
00:09:21,957 --> 00:09:22,875
DR. MEREDITH GREY: What?

171
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,522
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Good afternoon, interns.

172
00:09:27,052 --> 00:09:30,605
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: It's posted, but I thought I'd share the good news personally.

173
00:09:30,677 --> 00:09:33,950
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: As you know, the honor of performing the first surgery

174
00:09:33,993 --> 00:09:37,375
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: is reserved for the intern that shows the most promise.

175
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:40,980
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: As I'm running the O.R. today, I get to make that choice.

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,332
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: George O’Malley.

177
00:09:44,414 --> 00:09:45,126
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Me?

178
00:09:45,306 --> 00:09:47,481
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: You'll scrub in for an appendectomy this afternoon.

179
00:09:47,575 --> 00:09:48,629
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Congratulations.

180
00:09:48,947 --> 00:09:49,735
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Enjoy it.

181
00:09:56,489 --> 00:09:57,588
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Did he say me?

182
00:09:58,067 --> 00:10:01,884
DR. ALEX KAREV (LLM_UNCERTAIN): I've seen his file. George O’Malley barely made the cut to get in this program.

183
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:03,129
DR. ALEX KAREV (LLM_UNCERTAIN): He's not your guy.

184
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:04,265
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: He's my guy, all right.

185
00:10:04,352 --> 00:10:08,413
DR. ALEX KAREV (LLM_UNCERTAIN): Every year, you pick your guy, and every year, your guy suffers more than any other intern.

186
00:10:08,469 --> 00:10:10,552
DR. ALEX KAREV: Terrorize one, and the rest fall in line.

187
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:14,597
DR. ALEX KAREV (LLM_UNCERTAIN): I get it, I respect it, but George O’Malley’s a puppy.

188
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:16,466
NURSE OLIVIA HARPER (LLM_UNCERTAIN): - Katie Bryce - 3604? - It's right there.

189
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,341
MR. BRYCE (DB_VALIDATED, original: KATIE BRYCE'S PARENT): Thank you.

190
00:10:17,514 --> 00:10:19,967
MR. BRYCE (DB_VALIDATED, original: KATIE BRYCE'S PARENT): Katie, honey, mom and dad are here.

191
00:10:20,056 --> 00:10:23,441
DR. MEREDITH GREY (LLM_UNCERTAIN): They gave her a sedative for the C.T. scan, so she's a little groggy.

192
00:10:23,517 --> 00:10:24,796
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Will she be all right?

193
00:10:24,946 --> 00:10:29,109
MR. BRYCE: Our doctor at home said that she might need an operation. Is that true?

194
00:10:29,173 --> 00:10:30,316
DR. MEREDITH GREY: What kind of operation?

195
00:10:30,408 --> 00:10:32,783
DR. MEREDITH GREY: She's, um - well...

196
00:10:33,615 --> 00:10:35,687
DR. MEREDITH GREY: You know what? I'm not the doctor.

197
00:10:35,871 --> 00:10:40,971
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I'm a doctor, but I'm not Katie's doctor, so I'll go get him for you.

198
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,682
DR. MEREDITH GREY (LLM_UNCERTAIN): What?

199
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:49,025
DR. MEREDITH GREY (LLM_UNCERTAIN): Katie's parents have questions. Do you talk to them, or do I ask Burke?

200
00:10:49,153 --> 00:10:51,427
DR. CRISTINA YANG (LLM_UNCERTAIN): No, Burke's off the case. Katie belongs to the new

201
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,725
DR. CRISTINA YANG (LLM_UNCERTAIN): attending now, Dr. Shepherd. He's over there.

202
00:11:15,403 --> 00:11:16,684
DR. MEREDITH GREY (LLM_UNCERTAIN): Dr. Shepherd.

203
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:18,067
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Dr. Shepherd?

204
00:11:18,774 --> 00:11:20,234
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): This morning, it was Derek.

205
00:11:20,636 --> 00:11:22,188
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Now it's Dr. Shepherd.

206
00:11:22,369 --> 00:11:24,422
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Dr. Shepherd, we should pretend it never happened.

207
00:11:24,498 --> 00:11:28,384
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): What never happened - you sleeping with me last night, or you throwing me out this morning?

208
00:11:28,456 --> 00:11:30,663
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Because both are fond memories I'd like to hold onto.

209
00:11:30,754 --> 00:11:33,145
DR. MEREDITH GREY: No, there will be no memories.

210
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,023
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I'm not the girl in the bar anymore, and you're not the guy.

211
00:11:36,222 --> 00:11:37,480
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): This can't exist.

212
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:38,951
DR. MEREDITH GREY: You get that, right?

213
00:11:39,222 --> 00:11:41,158
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): You took advantage of me, and now you want to forget about it.

214
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,067
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I was drunk, vulnerable, and good-looking, and you took advantage.

215
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:47,385
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Okay, I was the one who was drunk, and you are not that good-looking.

216
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,578
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Maybe not today.

217
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:52,373
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Last night, I was very good-looking. I had my red shirt on. You took advantage.

218
00:11:52,475 --> 00:11:54,114
DR. CRISTINA YANG: I did not take advantage.

219
00:11:54,126 --> 00:11:55,777
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Want to take advantage again - say, friday night?

220
00:11:57,615 --> 00:11:58,495
DR. MEREDITH GREY: No.

221
00:11:59,703 --> 00:12:02,274
DR. MEREDITH GREY: You're an attending, and I'm your intern.

222
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:04,850
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Stop looking at me like that.

223
00:12:05,027 --> 00:12:05,710
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Like what?

224
00:12:05,777 --> 00:12:07,205
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Like you've seen me naked.

225
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,278
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Dr. Shepherd, this is inappropriate.

226
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:14,399
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Has that ever occurred to you?

227
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:22,407
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY (DB_VALIDATED, original: INTERN (LIKELY GEORGE O'MALLEY OR ANOTHER INTERN RECITING STEPS)): Open, identify, ligate, remove, irrigate, close.

INTERN (LIKELY ANOTHER INTERN ECHOING THE MANTRA) (LLM_UNCERTAIN): Open, identify, ligate, remove, irrigate, close.

229
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:26,890

230
00:12:26,989 --> 00:12:28,929
DR. CRISTINA YANG (DB_VALIDATED, original: CRISTINA YANG): No, code brown, right in his pants.

231
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:31,552
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: He's all about the flop sweat. He's gonna sweat himself unsterile.

232
00:12:31,613 --> 00:12:33,270
DR. CRISTINA YANG: 10 bucks says he messes up the Mcburney.

233
00:12:33,332 --> 00:12:34,110
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: $15 says he cries.

234
00:12:34,162 --> 00:12:35,580
DR. ALEX KAREV: I'll put $20 on a total meltdown.

235
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:38,001
DR. MEREDITH GREY (DB_VALIDATED, original: MEREDITH GREY): $50 says he pulls the whole thing off.

236
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:43,813
DR. MEREDITH GREY: That's one of us down there, the first one of us.

237
00:12:43,885 --> 00:12:45,294
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Where's your loyalty?

238
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,842
CRISTINA YANG AND ALEX KAREV: - $75 says he can't even I.D. the appendix. - I'll take that action.

239
00:12:50,993 --> 00:12:53,602
DR. PRESTON BURKE: Okay, O’Malley, let's see what you can do.

240
00:12:54,642 --> 00:12:55,903

243
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,164

244
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,261
DR. PRESTON BURKE: More pressure.

245
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:16,966

246
00:13:20,913 --> 00:13:21,568

DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Thank you.

258
00:14:02,385 --> 00:14:06,815

259
00:14:07,302 --> 00:14:11,115
DR. PRESTON BURKE: and simultaneously pull up on the purse strings,

260
00:14:11,274 --> 00:14:12,952
DR. PRESTON BURKE: but be careful not to...

261
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,134
DR. PRESTON BURKE: break them.

262
00:14:16,414 --> 00:14:18,318
DR. PRESTON BURKE: You ripped the cecum.

263
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,424
DR. PRESTON BURKE: You've got a bleeder.

264
00:14:19,506 --> 00:14:21,427
DR. PRESTON BURKE: You're filling with stool. What do you do now?

265
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:22,307
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Uh...

266
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,474
DR. PRESTON BURKE: Think. You start the suction, and you start digging

267
00:14:26,486 --> 00:14:29,066
DR. PRESTON BURKE: for those purse strings before she bleeds to death.

268
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,586
DR. PRESTON BURKE: Give him a clamp.

269
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:31,729

270
00:14:32,158 --> 00:14:33,086

271
00:14:33,284 --> 00:14:34,325

273
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,522

274
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:42,812

275
00:14:44,498 --> 00:14:45,557

276
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:46,827

277
00:14:47,524 --> 00:14:48,835

282
00:14:59,852 --> 00:15:01,030
DR. CRISTINA YANG: License to kill.

283
00:15:11,173 --> 00:15:14,339
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: 007. They're calling me "007," aren't they?

284
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:16,283
DR. CRISTINA YANG (DB_VALIDATED, original: CRISTINA): - No one's calling you 007. - No one's calling you 007.

285
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,607
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: On the elevator, murphy whispered, "007."

286
00:15:18,683 --> 00:15:21,187
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: How many times do we have to go through this, George? 5, 10?

287
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:22,643
DR. CRISTINA YANG (DB_VALIDATED, original: CRISTINA): Give me a number, or else I'm gonna hit you.

288
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:24,827
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Murphy whispered, "007," and everyone laughed.

289
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,225
DR. ISOBEL STEVENS (DB_VALIDATED, original: IZZIE): He wasn't talking about you.

290
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,183
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Are you sure?

291
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,386
DR. CRISTINA YANG (DB_VALIDATED, original: CRISTINA): Would we lie to you?

292
00:15:28,724 --> 00:15:29,554
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Yes.

293
00:15:29,673 --> 00:15:31,378
DR. CRISTINA YANG (DB_VALIDATED, original: CRISTINA): 007 is a state of mind.

294
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:34,342
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Says the girl who finished first in her class at Stanford.

295
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:41,095
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Oh, man. It's 911 for Katie Bryce.

296
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:43,664
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I got to go.

297
00:15:50,477 --> 00:15:52,518
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Maybe I should have gone into geriatrics.

298
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,067
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: No one minds when you kill an old person.

299
00:15:55,171 --> 00:16:00,250
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Surgery is hot. It's the marines. It's macho. It's hostile. It's hard-core.

300
00:16:00,644 --> 00:16:04,539
DR. CRISTINA YANG (DB_VALIDATED, original: CRISTINA): Geriatrics is for freaks who live with their mothers and never have sex.

301
00:16:07,094 --> 00:16:09,178
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: I've got to get my own place.

302
00:16:16,116 --> 00:16:17,417
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Excuse me! Excuse me!

303
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:21,907
KATIE BRYCE: Took you long enough.

304
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,864
DR. MEREDITH GREY: You're okay? The nurse paged me "911."

305
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:27,052
KATIE BRYCE: I had to go all "exorcist" to get her to even pick up the phone.

306
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,159
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Wait.

307
00:16:30,395 --> 00:16:31,677
DR. MEREDITH GREY: There's nothing wrong with you?

308
00:16:31,748 --> 00:16:32,602
KATIE BRYCE: I'm bored.

309
00:16:34,687 --> 00:16:35,783
DR. MEREDITH GREY: You little...

310
00:16:36,678 --> 00:16:39,326
DR. MEREDITH GREY: - I'm not a cruise director. - You don't have to wig out.

311
00:16:39,654 --> 00:16:43,477
KATIE BRYCE: The pageant's supposed to be on cable, but this crappy hospital doesn't get the channel.

312
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,334
KATIE BRYCE: If that cow kylie wood is gonna walk off with my crown, I have to see it.

313
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:48,736
KATIE BRYCE: Can you call someone?

314
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:54,030
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Okay, this is an actual hospital.

315
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,879
DR. MEREDITH GREY: There are sick people here.

316
00:16:56,053 --> 00:16:58,688
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Go to sleep, and stop wasting my time.

317
00:16:58,782 --> 00:17:01,331
KATIE BRYCE: But I can't sleep. My head's all full.

318
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:02,769
DR. MEREDITH GREY: That's called "thinking."

319
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:03,808
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Go with it.

320
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:18,269
DR. ISOBEL STEVENS (DB_VALIDATED, original: IZZIE): What do you need?

321
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,355
NURSE (LLM_UNCERTAIN): Mr. Jones has junky veins, and he really needs antibiotics.

322
00:17:22,405 --> 00:17:24,068
DR. ISOBEL STEVENS (DB_VALIDATED, original: IZZIE): I should start a central line.

323
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:25,192
DR. PRESTON BURKE: So start one.

324
00:17:26,236 --> 00:17:27,407
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: You don't know how.

325
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:29,009
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: I've never done one.

326
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,107
NURSE: Well, you know what that means.

327
00:17:34,217 --> 00:17:35,906
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Can't we just page someone else?

328
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,330
NURSE: She's the on-call resident.

329
00:17:38,743 --> 00:17:39,573
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Okay.

330
00:17:40,547 --> 00:17:42,077
DR. ISOBEL STEVENS: Okay, I'll just - I'll wake her.

331
00:17:49,231 --> 00:17:51,805
DR. ISOBEL STEVENS (DB_VALIDATED, original: IZZIE): - Dr. Bailey, I don't mean to bother you. - Then don't.

332
00:17:51,892 --> 00:17:54,192
DR. ISOBEL STEVENS (DB_VALIDATED, original: IZZIE): - It's Mr. Jones. - Is he dying?

333
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:54,990
DR. ISOBEL STEVENS (DB_VALIDATED, original: IZZIE): No.

334
00:17:55,092 --> 00:17:56,864
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Then stop talking to me.

335
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,095
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: What is it?!

336
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:17,696
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Next time you wake me, he better be so close to dead, there's a tag on his toe.

337
00:18:26,913 --> 00:18:28,740
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Here. Take these to the lab.

338
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,565
DR. ISOBEL STEVENS (DB_VALIDATED, original: IZZIE STEVENS): 4-b's got post-op pneumonia.

339
00:18:36,642 --> 00:18:37,634
DR. ALEX KAREV (DB_VALIDATED, original: ALEX KAREV): Let's start antibiotics.

340
00:18:37,737 --> 00:18:40,098
DR. ISOBEL STEVENS (DB_VALIDATED, original: IZZIE STEVENS): Are you sure that's the right diagnosis?

341
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,941
DR. ALEX KAREV: Well, I don't know. I'm only an intern.

342
00:18:42,048 --> 00:18:46,692
DR. ALEX KAREV: Why don't you go spend 4 years in med school and then let me know if it's the right diagnosis?

343
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:49,938
DR. ISOBEL STEVENS (DB_VALIDATED, original: IZZIE STEVENS): She's short of breath. She's got fever. She's post-op.

344
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:51,382
DR. ALEX KAREV: Start the antibiotics.

345
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,450
DR. ALEX KAREV: God, I hate nurses.

346
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,525
DR. ALEX KAREV: I'm Alex.

347
00:18:59,153 --> 00:19:01,576
DR. ALEX KAREV: I'm with Jeremy. You're with the Nazi, right?

348
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:05,319
DR. ISOBEL STEVENS (DB_VALIDATED, original: IZZIE STEVENS): She may not have pneumonia, you know? She could be splinting, or have a P.E.

349
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,275
DR. ALEX KAREV: Like I said, I hate nurses.

350
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:09,593
DR. MEREDITH GREY: What did you just say?

351
00:19:11,053 --> 00:19:12,768
DR. ISOBEL STEVENS (DB_VALIDATED, original: IZZIE STEVENS): Did you just call me a nurse?

352
00:19:12,896 --> 00:19:14,422
DR. ALEX KAREV: Well, if the white cap fits.

353
00:19:17,844 --> 00:19:19,071
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Damn it, Katie.

354
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:21,896
DR. ALEX KAREV: Is she seeing anybody?

355
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:22,988
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: I don't know.

356
00:19:23,407 --> 00:19:24,304
DR. ALEX KAREV: She's hot.

357
00:19:24,513 --> 00:19:25,517
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: I'm friends with her.

358
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:29,553
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: I mean kind of friends - not actually friends, exactly,

359
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:33,505
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: but we're tight, and we hang out - really, only just today.

360
00:19:33,582 --> 00:19:35,665
DR. ALEX KAREV: - Dude. - Dude, stop talking.

361
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:51,387
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY (DB_VALIDATED, original: DR. BAILEY): What took you so long?

362
00:19:52,296 --> 00:19:54,883
NURSE (LLM_UNCERTAIN): She's having multiple grand mal seizures.

363
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,108
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Now, how do you want to proceed?

364
00:19:57,421 --> 00:19:59,647
NURSE: Dr. Grey, are you listening to me?!

365
00:20:00,544 --> 00:20:04,685
NURSE: She's got diazepam - 2 milligrams lorazepam - I just gave the second dose.

366
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:07,589
NURSE (LLM_UNCERTAIN): Dr. Grey, you need to tell us what you want to do.

367
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:09,483
NURSE (LLM_UNCERTAIN): Dr. Grey!

368
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,253
DR. MEREDITH GREY (DB_VALIDATED, original: MEREDITH GREY): - Okay, she's full on lorazepam? - She's had 4 milligrams.

369
00:20:18,376 --> 00:20:20,213
DR. MEREDITH GREY: You paged Dr. Bailey and Dr. Shepherd?

370
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,448
NURSE: Lorazepam's not working.

371
00:20:21,673 --> 00:20:23,695
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Phenobarbital - load her with phenobarbital.

372
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,035
NURSE: Pheno's in.

373
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,085
NURSE: No change.

374
00:20:28,304 --> 00:20:30,223
DR. MEREDITH GREY: - You paged Dr. Shepherd? - I just told you.

375
00:20:31,371 --> 00:20:33,193
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Well, page him again, stat.

376
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:34,198
NURSE (LLM_UNCERTAIN): What do you want to do?

377
00:20:34,632 --> 00:20:37,028
NURSE (LLM_UNCERTAIN): Dr. Grey, you need to tell us what you want to do.

378
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:40,449
NURSE (LLM_UNCERTAIN): - Heart stopped. - Code blue! Code blue!

379
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:43,280
NURSE (LLM_UNCERTAIN): Code blue! Code blue!

380
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:49,814
DR. MEREDITH GREY (DB_VALIDATED, original: MEREDITH GREY): Wait.

381
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:52,804
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Charge the pads to 200.

382
00:20:52,873 --> 00:20:53,607
NURSE: Charge.

383
00:20:53,822 --> 00:20:54,586
DR. MEREDITH GREY (DB_VALIDATED, original: MEREDITH GREY): Clear.

384
00:20:57,282 --> 00:20:58,662
NURSE: Still v-fib. Nothing.

385
00:20:58,755 --> 00:20:59,377
NURSE: Charging.

386
00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:00,416
NURSE: 19 seconds.

387
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:01,538
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Charge them to 300.

388
00:21:02,073 --> 00:21:03,780
NURSE: 300. Anything?

389
00:21:03,857 --> 00:21:04,738
NURSE: 27 seconds.

390
00:21:05,157 --> 00:21:06,319
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Charge to 360.

391
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:08,834
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Come on, Katie.

392
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:09,980
NURSE: 49 seconds.

393
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:12,198
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: At 60 seconds, you're supposed to admin her another drug.

394
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:12,869
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Charge again!

395
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:15,607
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Charge again.

396
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:21,638
DR. MEREDITH GREY (DB_VALIDATED, original: MEREDITH GREY): Anything?

397
00:21:21,838 --> 00:21:22,961
NURSE: I see sinus rhythm.

398
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:24,946
NURSE: Blood pressure's coming up.

399
00:21:25,097 --> 00:21:25,847
DR. MEREDITH GREY (DB_VALIDATED, original: MEREDITH GREY): All right.

400
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,884
NURSE: Pressure's returning.

401
00:21:28,136 --> 00:21:29,084
NURSE: Rate's coming back.

402
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,820
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: What the hell happened?

403
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:33,031
DR. MEREDITH GREY: She had a seizure, and her heart stopped.

404
00:21:33,144 --> 00:21:34,557
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY (DB_VALIDATED, original: DR. BAILEY): You were supposed to be monitoring her.

405
00:21:34,778 --> 00:21:37,177
NURSE (LLM_UNCERTAIN): - I checked on her - - I got her. Just - just go.

406
00:21:40,902 --> 00:21:41,880
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Somebody give me her -

407
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,059
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: give me her chart, please.

408
00:21:44,356 --> 00:21:46,856
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: You get a 911, you page me immediately,

409
00:21:46,923 --> 00:21:49,769
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: not in the 5 minutes it takes you to get to the emergency, immediately.

410
00:21:49,846 --> 00:21:53,247
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: You're on my team, and if somebody dies, it's my ass.

411
00:21:55,462 --> 00:21:56,256
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY: Meredith?

412
00:22:19,112 --> 00:22:20,673
DR. MEREDITH GREY: You tell anyone, ever...

413
00:22:31,873 --> 00:22:34,375
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): You said it was a seizure disorder.

414
00:22:34,502 --> 00:22:35,531
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Now you're saying it isn't?

415
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:37,077
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I'm saying that I don't know.

416
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:38,404
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): What do you think it could be?

417
00:22:38,544 --> 00:22:39,295
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I don't know.

418
00:22:39,387 --> 00:22:40,298
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): When will you know?

419
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,701
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I don't have an answer for you.

420
00:22:41,773 --> 00:22:45,930
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): - For now, Katie is stable, and - - Wait one damn minute.

421
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:50,452
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): We came here because this hospital is supposed to be the best in Washington.

422
00:22:51,142 --> 00:22:53,989
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): That's my kid in there - my kid -

423
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,862
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): and you have the audacity to stand here and tell me, "I don't know."

424
00:22:56,932 --> 00:22:57,511
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Mr. Bryce -

425
00:22:57,593 --> 00:23:01,112
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): No, I want someone else, a doctor who knows what they're doing.

426
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:03,651
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): You get me someone else, someone better than you.

427
00:23:03,718 --> 00:23:05,791
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Mr. Bryce, I assure you that I am working hard on Katie's case.

428
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:09,047
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): No, you're not. If you were, you'd be able to give me some answers.

429
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,786
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I put you on the bypass machine, which pumps blood for your heart.

430
00:23:13,036 --> 00:23:16,742
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Fix your ticker, take you off the machine - I'm done - simple procedure.

431
00:23:17,573 --> 00:23:19,588
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): So I shouldn't worry?

432
00:23:19,873 --> 00:23:21,509
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I'm very good at what I do.

433
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:23,144
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): But still it's surgery.

434
00:23:23,213 --> 00:23:24,403
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): There are some risks.

435
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,761
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I'll see you in the O.R. this afternoon, Mr. Savitch.

436
00:23:29,778 --> 00:23:32,313
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): You're not gonna leave me alone with that guy, are you?

437
00:23:33,941 --> 00:23:36,138
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Oh, I'll be outside the O.R. the whole time.

438
00:23:36,518 --> 00:23:38,845
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: No, Dr. Burke is very good.

439
00:23:39,306 --> 00:23:40,223
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Don't worry.

440
00:23:40,868 --> 00:23:41,780
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I'll see you after.

441
00:23:42,113 --> 00:23:43,694
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): He'll be fine, right?

442
00:23:43,771 --> 00:23:45,107
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Tony's gonna sail through it.

443
00:23:47,984 --> 00:23:50,627
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: You have nothing to worry about - I promise.

444
00:23:52,346 --> 00:23:53,442
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: I gotta go.

445
00:23:54,421 --> 00:23:55,317
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): What are you doing?

446
00:23:55,564 --> 00:23:59,520
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I'm suturing a banana with the vain hope that it wakes up my brain.

447
00:24:00,499 --> 00:24:02,455
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): What are you smiling at, 007?

448
00:24:03,473 --> 00:24:05,461
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I'm sorry. I get mean when I'm tired.

449
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:06,310
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: You know what?

450
00:24:06,707 --> 00:24:07,953
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: I don't care.

451
00:24:08,696 --> 00:24:12,834
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: I comforted a family, and I got to hang out in the O.R. today. All is well.

452
00:24:12,904 --> 00:24:14,353
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Does anybody know why we're here?

453
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:15,971
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Well, good morning.

454
00:24:18,011 --> 00:24:19,888
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I'm gonna do something pretty rare for a surgeon.

455
00:24:20,211 --> 00:24:21,942
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I'm gonna ask interns for help.

456
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,282
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I've got this kid, Katie Bryce.

457
00:24:24,378 --> 00:24:26,461
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Right now, she's a mystery.

458
00:24:27,353 --> 00:24:28,848
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): She doesn't respond to our meds.

459
00:24:29,028 --> 00:24:31,087
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): The labs are clean, the scans are pure,

460
00:24:31,332 --> 00:24:35,003
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): but she's having seizures - grand mal seizures with no visible cause.

461
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,779
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): She's a ticking clock.

462
00:24:37,037 --> 00:24:40,630
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): She's gonna die if I don't make a diagnosis, which is where you come in.

463
00:24:41,089 --> 00:24:42,262
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I can't do it alone.

464
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,167
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I need your extra minds, extra eyes.

465
00:24:45,381 --> 00:24:48,747
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I need you to play detective. I need you to find out why Katie is having seizures.

466
00:24:49,431 --> 00:24:53,040
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I know you're tired. You're busy. You got more work than you can possibly handle.

467
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,236
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I understand, so I'm gonna give you an incentive.

468
00:24:56,569 --> 00:24:59,037
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Whoever finds the answer rides with me.

469
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:00,671
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Katie needs surgery.

470
00:25:01,231 --> 00:25:05,733
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): You get to do what no interns get to do - scrub in to assist on an advanced procedure.

471
00:25:06,244 --> 00:25:08,140
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Dr. Bailey's gonna hand you Katie's chart.

472
00:25:08,211 --> 00:25:09,753
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): The clock is ticking fast, people.

473
00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:11,883
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): If we're gonna save Katie's life, we have to do it soon.

474
00:25:19,057 --> 00:25:20,057
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Did you just page me?

475
00:25:20,182 --> 00:25:21,853
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Yes. 4-B's still short of breath.

476
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,480
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Look, give the antibiotics time to work.

477
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:26,294
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): The antibiotics should have worked by now.

478
00:25:26,503 --> 00:25:28,300
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): She's old. She's freaking ancient.

479
00:25:28,431 --> 00:25:30,001
DR. MEREDITH GREY: She's lucky she's still breathing.

480
00:25:30,692 --> 00:25:34,916
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I got a shot to scrub in downstairs on a patient that wasn't alive during the civil war.

481
00:25:34,987 --> 00:25:36,436
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Don't page me again.

482
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,342
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Hey, I want in on shepherd's surgery.

483
00:25:43,435 --> 00:25:45,021
DR. MEREDITH GREY: You've been the intern on Katie since the start.

484
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:46,338
DR. MEREDITH GREY: You want to work together?

485
00:25:46,455 --> 00:25:48,876
DR. MEREDITH GREY: If we find the answer, we have a 50-50 chance of scrubbing in.

486
00:25:48,971 --> 00:25:52,128
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I'll work with you, but I don't want in on the surgery. You can have it.

487
00:25:52,221 --> 00:25:54,442
DR. CRISTINA YANG: You're kidding? It's the biggest opportunity any intern will ever get.

488
00:25:54,526 --> 00:25:56,630
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I don't want to spend any more time with Shepherd than I have to.

489
00:25:56,715 --> 00:25:57,807
DR. CRISTINA YANG: What do you have against shepherd?

490
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,469
DR. MEREDITH GREY: If we find the answer, the surgery's yours. Do you want to work together or not?

491
00:26:02,138 --> 00:26:02,814
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Deal.

492
00:26:02,891 --> 00:26:05,962
DR. MEREDITH GREY (DB_VALIDATED, original: MEREDITH GREY): So she doesn't have anoxia, chronic renal failure, or acidosis.

493
00:26:06,034 --> 00:26:08,445
DR. CRISTINA YANG (DB_VALIDATED, original: CRISTINA YANG): It's not a tumor, because her C.T.'s clean.

494
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:11,432
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Are you seriously not gonna tell me why you won't work with Shepherd?

495
00:26:11,498 --> 00:26:12,146
DR. MEREDITH GREY: No.

496
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,311
DR. CRISTINA YANG: What about infection?

497
00:26:13,393 --> 00:26:16,941
DR. MEREDITH GREY: No, there's no white count, and she has no C.T. lesions, no fevers,

498
00:26:17,316 --> 00:26:19,762
DR. CRISTINA YANG: nothing in her spinal tap. Just tell me.

499
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:24,730
DR. MEREDITH GREY: You can't comment, make a face, or react in any way.

500
00:26:26,715 --> 00:26:27,733
DR. MEREDITH GREY: We had sex.

501
00:26:31,676 --> 00:26:33,105
DR. CRISTINA YANG: What about an aneurysm?

502
00:26:33,566 --> 00:26:35,630
DR. MEREDITH GREY: No blood on the C.T. and no headaches.

503
00:26:35,701 --> 00:26:40,114
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Okay, there's no drug use, no pregnancy, no trauma.

504
00:26:42,453 --> 00:26:43,472
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Was he good?

505
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,202
DR. CRISTINA YANG: I mean, he looks like he'd be good. Was it any good?

506
00:26:48,957 --> 00:26:50,011
DR. MEREDITH GREY: We're out of answers.

507
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:53,759
DR. CRISTINA YANG: What if no one comes up with anything?

508
00:26:53,852 --> 00:26:55,049
DR. MEREDITH GREY: You mean what if she dies?

509
00:26:55,135 --> 00:26:55,971
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Yeah.

510
00:26:57,538 --> 00:27:01,143
DR. CRISTINA YANG: This is gonna sound really bad, but I really wanted that surgery.

511
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,459
DR. MEREDITH GREY: She's just never gonna get the chance to turn into a person.

512
00:27:05,592 --> 00:27:10,490
DR. MEREDITH GREY: The sum total of her existence will be almost winning miss teen whatever.

513
00:27:12,503 --> 00:27:14,394
DR. MEREDITH GREY: You know what her pageant talent is?

514
00:27:14,473 --> 00:27:15,449
DR. CRISTINA YANG: They have talent?

515
00:27:15,954 --> 00:27:17,670
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Rhythmic gymnastics.

516
00:27:17,931 --> 00:27:19,799
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Oh, come on.

517
00:27:20,362 --> 00:27:22,680
DR. CRISTINA YANG: What is rhythmic gymnastics? I can't even say it.

518
00:27:22,692 --> 00:27:25,021
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I don't know what it is.

519
00:27:27,711 --> 00:27:30,664
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I think it's something with a ball and a -

520
00:27:32,201 --> 00:27:32,948
DR. CRISTINA YANG: What?

521
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,682
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Meredith, what?

522
00:27:35,784 --> 00:27:37,132
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Get up. Come on.

523
00:27:38,486 --> 00:27:41,141
DR. CRISTINA YANG: The only thing that she would possibly need is an angiogram.

524
00:27:41,361 --> 00:27:43,353
DR. MEREDITH GREY (DB_VALIDATED, original: MEREDITH GREY): Oh. Oh, Dr. Shepherd, just one moment.

525
00:27:44,013 --> 00:27:46,115
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Katie competes in beauty pageants.

526
00:27:46,204 --> 00:27:48,076
DR. MEREDITH GREY (DB_VALIDATED, original: MEREDITH GREY): I know that, but we have to save her life, anyway.

527
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,021
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD (LLM_UNCERTAIN): She has no headaches, no neck pain, her C.T. is clean.

528
00:27:51,144 --> 00:27:54,073
DR. MEREDITH GREY: - There's no medical proof of an aneurysm. - Right.

529
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,847
DR. MEREDITH GREY: - But what if she has an aneurysm, anyway? - There are no indicators.

530
00:27:56,935 --> 00:27:59,910
DR. MEREDITH GREY: She twisted her ankle practicing for the pageant.

531
00:28:00,018 --> 00:28:03,730
DR. MEREDITH GREY: - I appreciate you trying to help, but - - She fell when she twisted her ankle, she fell.

532
00:28:04,109 --> 00:28:06,500
DR. CRISTINA YANG (DB_VALIDATED, original: CRISTINA YANG): It was no big deal, not even a bump on the head. She

533
00:28:06,513 --> 00:28:08,915
DR. MEREDITH GREY: got up, iced her ankle, and everything was fine.

534
00:28:08,992 --> 00:28:10,724
DR. MEREDITH GREY: It was a fall so minor, her doctor didn't even

535
00:28:10,738 --> 00:28:12,480
DR. CRISTINA YANG: think to mention it when I was taking her history,

536
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:14,661
DR. MEREDITH GREY: but she did fall.

537
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,112
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD (LLM_UNCERTAIN): You know what the chance is that a minor fall could burst an aneurysm?

538
00:28:17,181 --> 00:28:18,650
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: One in a million - literally.

539
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,773
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD (LLM_UNCERTAIN): Let's go.

540
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:28,413
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Where?

541
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:30,221
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: To find out if Katie's one in a million.

542
00:28:48,265 --> 00:28:49,313
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: I'll be damned.

543
00:28:50,277 --> 00:28:51,096
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: There it is.

544
00:28:53,654 --> 00:28:55,304
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: It's minute, but it's there.

545
00:28:56,728 --> 00:28:58,371
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: It's a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

546
00:28:59,675 --> 00:29:01,652
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: She's bleeding into her brain.

547
00:29:06,938 --> 00:29:09,946
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: She could have gone through her entire life without it ever being a problem.

548
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:11,580
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD (LLM_UNCERTAIN): - One tap in the right spot... - And it exploded.

549
00:29:11,643 --> 00:29:13,269
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: Exactly. Now I can fix it.

550
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:15,585
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: You two did great work.

551
00:29:15,778 --> 00:29:18,856
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: Love to stay and kiss your asses, but I got to tell Katie's parents she's having surgery.

552
00:29:18,942 --> 00:29:20,570
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: - Katie Bryce's chart, please. - Here you go.

553
00:29:22,336 --> 00:29:26,576
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Dr. Shepherd, you'd said that you'd pick someone to scrub in if we helped?

554
00:29:26,663 --> 00:29:29,597
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: Oh, yes, right. I'm sorry I can't take you both.

555
00:29:29,653 --> 00:29:30,913
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: It's gonna be a full house.

556
00:29:31,057 --> 00:29:32,536
DR. DEREK SHEPHERD: Meredith, I'll see you in O.R.

557
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:41,584
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Good. Thank you.

558
00:29:50,568 --> 00:29:51,480
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Cristina...

559
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:55,308
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Wow, that was quick.

560
00:30:55,388 --> 00:30:57,914
DR. PRESTON BURKE: His heart had too much damage to give him a bypass.

561
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,230
DR. PRESTON BURKE (DB_VALIDATED, original: DR. BURKE): I had to let him go.

562
00:31:01,305 --> 00:31:04,058
DR. PRESTON BURKE (DB_VALIDATED, original: DR. BURKE): It happens - rarely, but it does happen -

563
00:31:04,248 --> 00:31:05,598
DR. PRESTON BURKE: the worst part of the game.

564
00:31:07,878 --> 00:31:12,741
INTERN (LLM_UNCERTAIN): But I told his wife - I told Gloria that he would be fine.

565
00:31:14,284 --> 00:31:16,265
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: - I promised her that - - You what?

566
00:31:16,464 --> 00:31:19,751
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: - They have four little girls. - This is my case.

567
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:21,445
DR. PRESTON BURKE (DB_VALIDATED, original: DR. BURKE): Did you hear me promise?

568
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,184
DR. PRESTON BURKE: The only one that can keep a promise like that is

569
00:31:24,198 --> 00:31:26,025
DR. PRESTON BURKE: god, and I haven't seen him holding a scalpel lately.

570
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:29,276
DR. PRESTON BURKE: You never promise a patient's family a good outcome!

571
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:32,039
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: I thought...

572
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:34,630
DR. PRESTON BURKE: You're important enough to make promises to Mrs. Savitch?

573
00:31:34,784 --> 00:31:37,207
DR. PRESTON BURKE: You get to be the one to tell her that she's a widow.

574
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:50,204
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Izzie.

575
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,529
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): - Maybe Meredith couldn't - - Izzie.

576
00:32:00,157 --> 00:32:04,593
DR. CRISTINA YANG: - I'll tell him I changed my mind. - Don't do me any favors. It's fine.

577
00:32:05,212 --> 00:32:07,982
DR. CRISTINA YANG: - Cristina - - You did a cutthroat thing. Deal with it.

578
00:32:08,068 --> 00:32:11,105
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Don't come to me for absolution. You want to be a shark, be a shark.

579
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:13,486
DR. CRISTINA YANG: - I'm not - - Oh, yes, you are.

580
00:32:13,614 --> 00:32:16,497
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Only it makes you feel all bad in your warm, gooey places.

581
00:32:16,992 --> 00:32:18,018
DR. CRISTINA YANG: No, screw you.

582
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:20,199
DR. CRISTINA YANG: I don't get picked for surgeries 'cause I slept with my boss,

583
00:32:20,265 --> 00:32:22,395
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): and I didn't get into med school 'cause I have a famous mother.

584
00:32:22,461 --> 00:32:24,535
DR. CRISTINA YANG: Some of us have to earn what we get.

585
00:32:37,192 --> 00:32:40,427
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Gloria, there were complications in the surgery.

586
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,913
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Tony's heart had a lot of damage.

587
00:32:45,626 --> 00:32:49,634
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): We tried to take him off bypass, but...

588
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:53,874
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): there wasn't anything we could have done.

589
00:32:56,498 --> 00:32:58,205
DR. MEREDITH GREY: What are you talking about?

590
00:32:59,449 --> 00:33:00,195
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: He...

591
00:33:02,634 --> 00:33:03,740
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Tony died.

592
00:33:04,247 --> 00:33:05,173
DR. MEREDITH GREY: He's dead.

593
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:07,980
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: Gloria...

594
00:33:08,942 --> 00:33:09,838
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: I am so sorry.

595
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,696
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Please...

596
00:33:19,085 --> 00:33:20,201
DR. MEREDITH GREY: go away.

597
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:51,763
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I promised I'd make her look cool.

598
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:54,127
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Apparently, being a bald beauty queen is the worst

599
00:33:54,141 --> 00:33:56,114
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): thing that happened in the history of the world.

600
00:33:58,357 --> 00:34:01,367
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Did you choose me for the surgery because I slept with you?

601
00:34:01,903 --> 00:34:02,708
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Yes.

602
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:06,722
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I'm kidding.

603
00:34:07,867 --> 00:34:09,677
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I'm not gonna scrub in for surgery.

604
00:34:09,782 --> 00:34:11,637
DR. MEREDITH GREY: You should ask Cristina. She really wants it.

605
00:34:11,724 --> 00:34:12,947
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): You're Katie's doctor.

606
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:16,855
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): And on your first day, with very little training, you helped save her life.

607
00:34:16,947 --> 00:34:20,391
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): You earned the right to follow her case through to the finish.

608
00:34:20,628 --> 00:34:25,501
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): You shouldn't let the fact that we had sex get in the way of you taking your shot.

609
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,485
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I wish I wanted to be a chef

610
00:34:41,927 --> 00:34:45,045
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: or a ski instructor or a kindergarten teacher.

611
00:34:46,295 --> 00:34:48,987
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: You know, I would have been a really good postal worker.

612
00:34:49,873 --> 00:34:51,168
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: I'm dependable.

613
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:57,001
DR. MEREDITH GREY: You know, my parents tell everyone they meet that their son's a surgeon,

614
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,150
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: as if it's a big accomplishment -

615
00:34:59,949 --> 00:35:02,027
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: superhero or something.

616
00:35:04,465 --> 00:35:06,052
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: If they could see me now.

617
00:35:09,335 --> 00:35:12,007
DR. MEREDITH GREY: When I told my mother I wanted to go to medical school,

618
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,612
DR. MEREDITH GREY: she tried to talk me out of it -

619
00:35:15,967 --> 00:35:18,438
DR. MEREDITH GREY: said I didn't have what it takes to be a surgeon,

620
00:35:19,181 --> 00:35:20,666
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: that I'd never make it.

621
00:35:21,782 --> 00:35:26,512
DR. MEREDITH GREY: So the way I see it, superhero sounds pretty damn good.

622
00:35:31,023 --> 00:35:32,826
DR. GEORGE O'MALLEY: We're gonna survive this, right?

623
00:35:40,213 --> 00:35:43,081
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): She's still short of breath. Did you get an abg or a chest film?

624
00:35:43,168 --> 00:35:44,259
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Oh, yes, sir, I did.

625
00:35:44,356 --> 00:35:45,467
DR. MEREDITH GREY: And what did you see?

626
00:35:46,152 --> 00:35:48,686
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Oh, well, I had a lot of patients last night.

627
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:50,898
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Name the common causes of post-op fever.

628
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:54,278
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): - Uh, yes. - From your head, not from a book.

629
00:35:54,371 --> 00:35:56,518
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Don't look it up. Learn it. It should be in your head.

630
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,688
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Name the common causes of post-op fever.

631
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:02,567
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Uh... the common causes of post-

632
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:06,056
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Can anybody name the common causes of post-op fever?

633
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:13,177
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Wind, Water, Wound, Walking, Wonder drugs - the five W's -

634
00:36:13,387 --> 00:36:15,143
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): most of the time, it's Wind -

635
00:36:15,255 --> 00:36:16,827
DR. MEREDITH GREY: splinting or pneumonia.

636
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:22,110
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Pneumonia's easy to assume, especially if you're too busy to do the tests.

637
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,304
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): What do you think's wrong with 4-b?

638
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,103
DR. MEREDITH GREY: The fourth "W," "Walking."

639
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,791
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I think she's a prime candidate for a pulmonary embolus.

640
00:36:33,896 --> 00:36:35,034
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): How would you diagnose?

641
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:41,322
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Spiral C.T., V/Q scan, provide O2,

642
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:45,085
DR. MEREDITH GREY: dose with heparin, and consult for an IVC filter.

643
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:51,146
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Do exactly as she says, then tell your resident that I want you off this case.

644
00:36:52,601 --> 00:36:55,601
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I'd know you anywhere. You're the spitting image of your mother.

645
00:36:56,509 --> 00:36:57,603
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Welcome to the game.

646
00:37:15,744 --> 00:37:18,704
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): All right, everybody. It's a beautiful night to save lives.

647
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,425
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Let's have some fun.

648
00:37:30,153 --> 00:37:33,516
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I can't think of any one reason why I want to be a surgeon...

649
00:37:35,661 --> 00:37:38,599
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): but I can think of a thousand reasons why I should quit.

650
00:37:53,509 --> 00:37:55,344
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): They make it hard on purpose.

651
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,753
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): There are lives in our hands.

652
00:38:11,257 --> 00:38:14,958
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): There comes a moment when it's more than just a game...

653
00:38:26,228 --> 00:38:28,358
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): And you either take that step forward

654
00:38:29,536 --> 00:38:31,481
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): or turn around and walk away.

655
00:38:51,208 --> 00:38:52,268
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I could quit,

656
00:38:52,871 --> 00:38:54,054
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): but here's the thing...

657
00:38:57,563 --> 00:38:59,010
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I love the playing field.

658
00:39:07,811 --> 00:39:09,527
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): - It was good surgery. - Yeah.

659
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:22,695
DR. MEREDITH GREY (DB_VALIDATED, original: MEREDITH GREY): We don't have to do that thing where I say something, and then you say something,

660
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:26,045
DR. MEREDITH GREY (DB_VALIDATED, original: MEREDITH GREY): and then somebody cries, and there's a moment.

661
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:26,929
DR. CRISTINA YANG (DB_VALIDATED, original: CRISTINA YANG): Yuck.

662
00:39:27,663 --> 00:39:28,322
DR. MEREDITH GREY (DB_VALIDATED, original: MEREDITH GREY): Good.

663
00:39:32,362 --> 00:39:33,679
DR. CRISTINA YANG (DB_VALIDATED, original: CRISTINA YANG): You should get some sleep.

664
00:39:33,817 --> 00:39:34,887
DR. CRISTINA YANG (DB_VALIDATED, original: CRISTINA YANG): You look like crap.

665
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:37,309
DR. MEREDITH GREY (DB_VALIDATED, original: MEREDITH GREY): I look better than you.

666
00:39:37,804 --> 00:39:39,331
DR. CRISTINA YANG (DB_VALIDATED, original: CRISTINA YANG): That's not possible.

667
00:39:56,929 --> 00:39:58,284
DR. MEREDITH GREY: That was amazing.

668
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:05,228
DR. MEREDITH GREY: You practice on cadavers...

669
00:40:06,835 --> 00:40:07,989
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): you observe...

670
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:12,541
DR. MEREDITH GREY: and you think you know what you're gonna feel like, standing over that table, but...

671
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:15,621
DR. MEREDITH GREY: that was such a high.

672
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:22,599
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I don't know why anybody does drugs.

673
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:26,083
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Yeah.

674
00:40:31,612 --> 00:40:32,503
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): Yeah.

675
00:40:36,081 --> 00:40:38,355
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I should, uh, go do this.

676
00:40:40,552 --> 00:40:41,411
DR. MEREDITH GREY: You should.

677
00:40:45,771 --> 00:40:46,818
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): I'll see you around.

678
00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:49,362
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): See you around.

679
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:51,329
UNKNOWN (LOW_CONF): See you.

680
00:40:56,644 --> 00:40:57,606
DR. MEREDITH GREY: So...

681
00:40:58,143 --> 00:41:00,202
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I made it through my first shift.

682
00:41:01,103 --> 00:41:02,184
DR. MEREDITH GREY: We all did.

683
00:41:04,043 --> 00:41:07,016
DR. MEREDITH GREY: The other interns are all good people. You'd like them...

684
00:41:08,293 --> 00:41:09,213
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I think.

685
00:41:10,965 --> 00:41:12,876
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I don't know - maybe.

686
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:15,358
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I like them.

687
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:23,166
DR. MEREDITH GREY: Oh, and I changed my mind.

688
00:41:23,385 --> 00:41:24,969
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I'm not gonna sell the house.

689
00:41:25,686 --> 00:41:26,760
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I'm gonna keep it.

690
00:41:28,648 --> 00:41:30,876
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I'll have to get a couple of roommates, but...

691
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:33,103
DR. MEREDITH GREY: it's home, you know?

692
00:41:36,978 --> 00:41:38,376
DR. ELLIS GREY: Are you the doctor?

693
00:41:39,206 --> 00:41:39,923
DR. MEREDITH GREY: No.

694
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:42,704
DR. MEREDITH GREY: I'm not your doctor,

695
00:41:43,391 --> 00:41:44,793
DR. MEREDITH GREY: but I am a doctor.

696
00:41:51,577 --> 00:41:52,632
DR. ELLIS GREY (DB_VALIDATED, original: ELLIS GREY): What's your name?

697
00:41:55,673 --> 00:41:57,813
DR. MEREDITH GREY: It's me, mom - Meredith.

698
00:42:01,295 --> 00:42:02,237
DR. ELLIS GREY: All right.

699
00:42:09,097 --> 00:42:11,032
DR. ELLIS GREY: I used to be a doctor, I think.

700
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:23,869
DR. MEREDITH GREY: You were a doctor, mom.

701
00:42:24,407 --> 00:42:25,588
DR. MEREDITH GREY: You were a surgeon.
