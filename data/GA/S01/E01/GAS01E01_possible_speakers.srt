1
00:00:04,097 --> 00:00:04,679
Meredith Grey: The game.

2
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:09,413
Meredith Grey: They say a person either has what it takes to play or they don't.

3
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:12,903
Meredith Grey: My mother was one of the greats.

4
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:18,140
Meredith Grey: Me, on the other hand, I'm kind of screwed.

5
00:00:37,173 --> 00:00:41,655
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey OR Meredith Grey (PVM): This is, uh... Humiliating on so many levels.

6
00:00:41,996 --> 00:00:42,578
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): You have to go.

7
00:00:42,618 --> 00:00:45,960

8
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:46,801
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): No, seriously.

9
00:00:46,822 --> 00:00:47,621

10
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:48,161
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): I'm late.

11
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:53,408
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Which isn't what you want to be on your first day of work, so... So, uh, you actually live here?

12
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:54,307
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): No.

13
00:00:55,368 --> 00:00:55,810

Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): It's nice.

18
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:02,414
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): A little dusty.

19
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:04,215
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Odd, but it's nice.

20
00:01:04,236 --> 00:01:07,180

21
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,423
Meredith Grey: I moved two weeks ago from Boston.

22
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:10,462

23
00:01:10,524 --> 00:01:11,084
Meredith Grey: I'm selling it.

24
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:11,965
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Oh, I'm sorry.

25
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:13,426

26
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:14,929

27
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:16,971

28
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,793

29
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:19,655
Meredith / Meredith Grey (PVM): We don't have to do the thing.

30
00:01:19,715 --> 00:01:20,234
Derek / Meredith Grey (PVM): Oh.

31
00:01:21,137 --> 00:01:21,917

33
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:24,280
Meredith / Meredith Grey (PVM): Exchange the details.

34
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:25,161
Meredith / Meredith Grey (PVM): Pretend we care.

35
00:01:25,662 --> 00:01:27,664
Meredith / Meredith Grey (PVM): Look, I'm gonna go upstairs and take a shower, okay?

36
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:29,906

37

44
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:44,277
Meredith Grey: Mm-hmm.

45
00:01:44,298 --> 00:01:44,881
Dr. Derek Shepherd: Nice meeting you.

Meredith Grey: Bye, Derek.

47
00:02:06,155 --> 00:02:09,699
Meredith Grey: Each of you comes here today hopeful, wanting in on the game.

48
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:13,287
Meredith Grey: A month ago, you were in med school being taught by doctors.

49
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,216
Meredith Grey: Today, you are the doctors.

50
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,966
Meredith Grey: The seven years you spend here as a surgical resident will be the best and worst of your life.

51
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:26,949
Meredith Grey: You will be pushed to the breaking point.

52
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:28,734
Meredith Grey: Look around you.

53
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:31,318

55
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:36,501

56
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,763

57
00:02:38,884 --> 00:02:40,668
Dr. Richard Webber / Meredith Grey (PVM): This is your starting line.

58
00:02:40,687 --> 00:02:41,870
Dr. Richard Webber / Meredith Grey (PVM): This is your arena.

59
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,896
Dr. Richard Webber / Meredith Grey (PVM): How well you play, that's up to you.

60
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:52,007
Meredith Grey: Like I said, I'm screwed.

61
00:03:03,545 --> 00:03:10,193
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Meredith Grey OR George O'Malley (PVM): OK, Martin, Robinson, Vaughn, Hawkins, Vaughn.

63
00:03:13,256 --> 00:03:15,018

64
00:03:15,818 --> 00:03:18,121
Unknown Intern / Meredith Grey (PVM): Seriously, that's going to help with the respect thing?

65
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:20,223
Unknown Intern / Meredith Grey OR George O'Malley (PVM): You're Christina, right?

66
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,264
Dr. Miranda Bailey / George O'Malley (PVM): Hutton, Monroe, Krug, Osborne.

67
00:03:22,305 --> 00:03:23,306
Unknown Intern / Meredith Grey OR George O'Malley (PVM): Here we go.

68
00:03:23,324 --> 00:03:24,287
Unknown Intern / Meredith Grey (PVM): Which resident are you assigned to?

69
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:25,568
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): I got Bailey.

70
00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:26,027
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): Nazi?

71
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:26,728
Unknown Intern / Meredith Grey (PVM): Me too.

72
00:03:26,968 --> 00:03:27,788
Unknown Intern / Meredith Grey (PVM): You got the Nazi?

73
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:30,453
Unknown Intern / Meredith Grey (PVM): So did I. At least we'll be tortured together, right?

74
00:03:31,514 --> 00:03:32,574
George O'Malley: I'm George.

75
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:43,104
George O'Malley: O'Malley, we met at the mixer you had on a black dress with a slit at the side, strappy sandals.

76
00:03:43,126 --> 00:03:44,045
George O'Malley: Now you think I'm gay.

77
00:03:44,508 --> 00:03:46,030
George O'Malley: No, I'm not gay.

78
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:51,015

80
00:04:00,584 --> 00:04:01,544

81
00:04:02,467 --> 00:04:03,631

82
00:04:03,651 --> 00:04:07,520

83
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,700
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey (PVM): Maybe it's professional jealousy.

84
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:11,848
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Izzie Stevens OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Maybe she's brilliant and they call her a Nazi because they're jealous.

85
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,072
George O'Malley / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Maybe she's nice.

86
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:14,556
Cristina Yang / Dr. Izzie Stevens (PVM): Let me guess, you're the model.

87
00:04:16,278 --> 00:04:18,745
Dr. Izzie Stevens: Hi, I'm Isabelle Stevens, but everyone calls me Izzy.

88
00:04:20,884 --> 00:04:22,146
Dr. Miranda Bailey: I have five rules.

89
00:04:22,206 --> 00:04:23,048

90
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:24,810
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Rule number one, don't bother sucking up.

91
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:25,552
Dr. Miranda Bailey: I already hate you.

92
00:04:25,572 --> 00:04:26,593
Dr. Miranda Bailey: That's not going to change.

93
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:29,377
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Trauma protocol, phone list, pagers.

94
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:31,139
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Nurses will page you.

95
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,223
Dr. Miranda Bailey: You answer every page at a run.

96
00:04:33,343 --> 00:04:35,305
Dr. Miranda Bailey: A run, that's rule number two.

97
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:39,331
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Your first shift starts now and lasts 48 hours.

98
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:43,798
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Your interns, grunts, nobodies, bottom of the surgical food chain.

99
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:48,105
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Run labs, write orders, work every second night until you drop, and don't complain.

100
00:04:48,365 --> 00:04:49,826
Dr. Miranda Bailey: On call rooms.

101
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:51,069
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Attendings hog them.

102
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:52,552
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Sleep when you can, where you can.

103
00:04:52,612 --> 00:04:53,875
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Which brings me to rule number three.

104
00:04:53,956 --> 00:04:57,822
Dr. Miranda Bailey: If I'm sleeping, don't wake me unless your patient is actually dying.

105
00:04:58,043 --> 00:05:00,608

106
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:03,774
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Not only will you have killed someone, you would have woke me for no good reason.

107
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:04,254
Dr. Miranda Bailey: We clear?

108
00:05:05,257 --> 00:05:05,598
Interns / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Yes.

109
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,120
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): You said five rules.

110
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,242
George O'Malley / Meredith Grey (PVM): That was only four.

111
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:12,170
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Rule number five, when I move, you move.

112
00:05:30,511 --> 00:05:31,752
Dr. Miranda Bailey: What do we got?

113
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:36,442
Paramedic / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Katie Bryce, 15-year-old female, new onset seizures, intermittent for the past week.

114
00:05:36,622 --> 00:05:39,588

115
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,091
Dr. Miranda Bailey: All right, get on her side.

116
00:05:42,252 --> 00:05:44,196
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Izzy, 10 milligrams diazepam IM.

117
00:05:45,338 --> 00:05:47,341
Dr. Miranda Bailey: No, no, the white lead is on the right.

118
00:05:47,582 --> 00:05:49,425
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Righty, whitey, smoke over fire.

119
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:51,990
Dr. Miranda Bailey: A large bore IV, don't let the blood hemolyze.

120
00:05:52,011 --> 00:05:53,093
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Let's go.

121
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,047
Dr. Preston Burke: We got no wet fish on dry land.

122
00:06:00,387 --> 00:06:03,511
Intern / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Absolutely, Dr. Burke.

123
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:04,992
Dr. Preston Burke: Dr. Bailey, no shotgun.

124
00:06:05,552 --> 00:06:09,658
Dr. Miranda Bailey: That means every test in the book, CT, CBC, CHEM-7, tox screen.

125
00:06:09,677 --> 00:06:11,160
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Christina, you're on labs.

126
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:12,480
Dr. Miranda Bailey: George, patient workups.

127
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:14,684
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Meredith, get Katie for a CT.

128
00:06:14,862 --> 00:06:16,485
Dr. Miranda Bailey: She's your responsibility now.

129
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:18,067
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Wait, what about me?

130
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,252
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Honey, you get to do rectal exams.

131
00:06:38,584 --> 00:06:39,646
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): What are you doing here?

132
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:40,728
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Good morning.

133
00:06:40,749 --> 00:06:42,211
Christina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): Katie, Bryce's labs came out clear.

134
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:44,175
Christina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): There's nothing in the results that explain her seizures.

135
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:45,057
Christina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): I just thought you'd want to know.

136
00:06:45,177 --> 00:06:45,478
Meredith Grey / Unknown (PVM): OK.

137
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:52,610
George O'Malley / Meredith Grey (PVM): I heard every year the attending on-call picks the best intern and lets them perform a procedure during the first shift.

138
00:06:56,076 --> 00:06:57,740
George O'Malley / Meredith Grey (PVM): I'm just saying it's what I heard.

139
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,161
Christina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): Get away.

140
00:06:58,201 --> 00:06:59,343
Christina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): Now.

141
00:07:01,298 --> 00:07:02,540
Izzy Stevens / Meredith Grey OR Alex Karev (PVM): Yeah, sounds good.

142
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,221
Izzy Stevens / Alex Karev (PVM): You'll be fine.

143
00:07:03,661 --> 00:07:04,141
Izzy Stevens / Alex Karev (PVM): You'll be fine.

144
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,185
Patient (Katie Bryce) / Meredith Grey OR George O'Malley OR Alex Karev (PVM): If you don't count the fact that my bacon days are over, sure.

145
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:09,689
Patient (Katie Bryce) / George O'Malley (PVM): Should I bypass surgery tomorrow with Dr. Burke?

146
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,310
Izzy Stevens / George O'Malley (PVM): I hear he's good.

147
00:07:10,891 --> 00:07:14,415
Izzy Stevens / George O'Malley OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): And after that, you can have all the bacon-flavored soy product you can eat.

148
00:07:14,637 --> 00:07:15,819
Patient (Katie Bryce) / George O'Malley (PVM): Mm, kill me now.

149
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:18,723
Izzy Stevens / George O'Malley OR George O'Malley (PVM): I wish I could, but I'm a healer.

150
00:07:22,247 --> 00:07:22,968
Dr. Bailey / Meredith Grey (PVM): You're lost.

151
00:07:24,434 --> 00:07:25,375
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): I'm not lost.

152
00:07:25,795 --> 00:07:26,536
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): How are you feeling?

153
00:07:26,896 --> 00:07:28,319
Katie Bryce: How do you think I'm feeling?

154
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,922
Katie Bryce: I'm missing my pageant.

155

534
00:24:00,652 --> 00:24:02,393

535
00:24:03,835 --> 00:24:05,497
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I'm sorry I get mean when I'm tired.

536
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:06,116

537
00:24:07,377 --> 00:24:07,877

538
00:24:07,897 --> 00:24:11,702

544
00:24:20,491 --> 00:24:22,134

546
00:24:24,653 --> 00:24:26,276

547
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:28,720

548
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:34,808
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Her labs are clean, scans are pure, but she's having seizures, grand mal seizures with no visible cause.

549
00:24:35,871 --> 00:24:36,653
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): She's a ticking clock.

550
00:24:37,374 --> 00:24:40,377
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): She's gonna die if I don't make a diagnosis, which is where you come in.

551
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,161
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): I can't do it alone.

552
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:45,105
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): I need your extra minds, extra eyes.

553
00:24:45,707 --> 00:24:46,646
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): I need you to play detective.

554
00:24:46,788 --> 00:24:48,932
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): I need you to find out why Katie is having seizures.

555
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:52,865
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): I know you're tired, you're busy, you got more work than you could possibly handle.

556
00:24:53,548 --> 00:24:54,169
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): I understand.

557
00:24:54,489 --> 00:24:56,069
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): So I'm gonna give you an incentive.

558
00:24:56,852 --> 00:24:58,795

559
00:24:59,796 --> 00:25:00,635

560
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:05,482
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): You get to do what no interns get to do, scrub in to assist on an advanced procedure.

561
00:25:06,585 --> 00:25:08,145
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Dr. Bailey's gonna hand you Katie's chart.

562
00:25:08,386 --> 00:25:09,587
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): The clock is ticking fast, people.

563
00:25:10,348 --> 00:25:12,251
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): If we're gonna save Katie's life, we have to do it soon.

564
00:25:19,336 --> 00:25:20,219
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Did you just page me?

565
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,020
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey OR Katie Bryce (PVM): Yes, 4B's still short of breath.

566
00:25:23,044 --> 00:25:24,404
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Look, give the antibiotics time to work.

567
00:25:24,644 --> 00:25:26,087
Meredith Grey / Katie Bryce (PVM): The antibiotics should have worked by now.

568
00:25:26,788 --> 00:25:27,190
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): She's old.

569
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,092
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): She's freaking ancient.

570
00:25:28,553 --> 00:25:29,732
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): She's lucky she's still breathing.

571
00:25:31,017 --> 00:25:34,701
George O'Malley / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I got a shot to scrub in downstairs on a patient who wasn't alive during the Civil War.

572
00:25:35,123 --> 00:25:36,384
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Don't page me again.

573
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,313
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): Hey, I want in on Shepard's surgery.

574
00:25:43,471 --> 00:25:44,894
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): You've been the intern on Kitty since the start.

575
00:25:45,173 --> 00:25:45,997
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): You want to work together?

576
00:25:46,596 --> 00:25:48,740
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): If we find the answer, we have a 50-50 chance of scrubbing in.

577
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:51,002
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): I'll work with you, but I don't want in on the surgery.

578
00:25:51,163 --> 00:25:51,765
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): You can have it.

579
00:25:52,326 --> 00:25:52,645
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): Are you kidding?

580
00:25:52,665 --> 00:25:54,568
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): It's the biggest opportunity any intern will ever get.

581
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,593
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): I don't want to spend any more time with Shepard than I have to.

582
00:25:56,731 --> 00:25:57,574
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): What do you have against Shepard?

583
00:25:58,153 --> 00:25:59,817
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): If we find the answer, the surgery's yours.

584
00:25:59,836 --> 00:26:01,097
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): Do you want to work together or not?

585
00:26:02,421 --> 00:26:02,740
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Deal.

586
00:26:02,922 --> 00:26:06,227
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): So she doesn't have anoxia, chronic renal failure, or acidosis.

587
00:26:06,247 --> 00:26:08,108
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): It's not a tumor because her CT's clean.

588
00:26:09,305 --> 00:26:11,385

590
00:26:12,386 --> 00:26:13,209

596
00:26:31,945 --> 00:26:32,866

600
00:26:43,251 --> 00:26:45,154

602
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:49,864
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): A lot of answers.

603
00:26:52,386 --> 00:26:53,588

604
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,932

606
00:26:57,736 --> 00:27:00,861

607
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,310
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): She's just never going to get the chance to turn into a person.

608
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:09,934

00:27:23,807 --> 00:27:24,568

617
00:27:27,971 --> 00:27:32,096
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I think it's something with, like, a ball and a...

618
00:27:32,243 --> 00:27:34,659

619
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:35,343

00:27:53,603 --> 00:27:53,942
Dr. Shepherd / Meredith Grey (PVM): Right.

629
00:27:54,284 --> 00:27:55,786
Unknown / Meredith Grey (PVM): But what if she has an aneurysm anyway?

630
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:56,988
Dr. Shepherd / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): There are no indicators.

631
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,853
Unknown / Meredith Grey (PVM): Oh, but she twisted her ankle a few weeks ago when she was practicing for the pageant.

632
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:01,714

00:28:04,154 --> 00:28:06,178

636
00:28:06,198 --> 00:28:08,759
Unknown / Meredith Grey (PVM): You know, she got right back up, iced her ankle, and everything was fine.

637
00:28:09,101 --> 00:28:10,102
Dr. Shepherd / Meredith Grey (PVM): It was a false cell minor.

638
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:13,183
Unknown / Meredith Grey (PVM): Her doctor didn't even think to mention it when I was taking her history, but she did.

639
00:28:13,605 --> 00:28:14,486

640
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:17,107

641
00:28:17,127 --> 00:28:18,430
Unknown / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): One in a million, literally.

642
00:28:26,979 --> 00:28:27,459

643
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,358
Unknown / Meredith Grey (PVM): Where?

644
00:28:28,598 --> 00:28:30,280
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Mine out of Katie's one in a million.

645
00:28:48,366 --> 00:28:49,087
Dr. Shepherd / Dr. Preston Burke (PVM): I'll be damned.

646
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:50,892
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey (PVM): Here it is.

647
00:28:53,915 --> 00:28:54,999
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey (PVM): It's minute, but it's there.

648
00:28:56,961 --> 00:28:59,987
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Meredith Grey (PVM): It's a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

649
00:29:00,007 --> 00:29:01,269
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Meredith Grey (PVM): She's bleeding into her brain.

650
00:29:07,137 --> 00:29:09,784
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): She could have gone through her entire life without it ever being a problem.

651
00:29:10,262 --> 00:29:11,306
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): One tap in the right spot.

652
00:29:11,326 --> 00:29:11,787
Cristina Yang / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Exploded.

653
00:29:11,826 --> 00:29:12,326
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Exactly.

654
00:29:12,406 --> 00:29:13,650
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Now I get to fix it.

655
00:29:13,968 --> 00:29:15,347
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): You two did great work.

656
00:29:15,828 --> 00:29:18,692
Dr. Derek Shepherd: I'd love to stay and kiss your asses, but I gotta tell Katie's parents she's having surgery.

657
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:19,932
Dr. Derek Shepherd: Katie Bryce's chart, please.

658
00:29:20,094 --> 00:29:22,777
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Here you go.

659
00:29:22,797 --> 00:29:26,400
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Uh, Dr. Shepard, you said that you'd pick someone to scrub in if we helped?

660
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:27,500
Dr. Derek Shepherd: Oh, yes, right.

661
00:29:27,862 --> 00:29:29,663
Dr. Derek Shepherd: Um, I'm sorry I can't thank you both.

662
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:30,564
Dr. Derek Shepherd: It's gonna be a full house.

663
00:29:31,223 --> 00:29:32,226
Dr. Derek Shepherd: Meredith, I'll see you in O.R.

664
00:29:40,314 --> 00:29:40,413
Meredith Grey / Katie Bryce (PVM): Okay.

665
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:51,308
Meredith Grey / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Christina.

666
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,057
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): When it doesn't rain, it snores.

667
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,391
Meredith Grey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Yeah, the cookie crumbles, but in whose hand?

668
00:30:00,313 --> 00:30:03,820
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): All things said and all things done.

669
00:30:04,644 --> 00:30:06,146
Meredith Grey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Life is short.

670
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:24,945
Meredith Grey / Gloria (PVM): And plenty done, life's too short, oh

671
00:30:54,406 --> 00:30:55,288
George O'Malley / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Alex Karev (PVM): Wow, that was quick.

672
00:30:55,469 --> 00:30:57,652
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): His heart had too much damage to get him off the bypass.

673
00:30:57,672 --> 00:30:59,973
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I had to let him go.

674
00:31:01,537 --> 00:31:03,720
Preston Burke / Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): It happens rarely, but it does happen.

675
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:05,280
Preston Burke / Alex Karev (PVM): The worst part of the game.

676
00:31:08,105 --> 00:31:12,411
George O'Malley / Alex Karev (PVM): But I... I told... I told Gloria that he would be fine.

677
00:31:12,431 --> 00:31:15,894
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Alex Karev (PVM): I promised her that... You what?

678
00:31:16,694 --> 00:31:17,517
George O'Malley / Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): They have four little girls.

679
00:31:17,537 --> 00:31:18,597
Cristina Yang / Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I don't want you to promise anything.

680
00:31:18,637 --> 00:31:19,420
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): This is my case.

681
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,240
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Did you hear me promise?

682
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,428
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): The only one that can keep a promise like that is God, and I haven't seen him holding a scalpel lately.

683
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:28,951
Cristina Yang / Dr. Preston Burke OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You never promise a patient's family a good outcome.

684
00:31:31,255 --> 00:31:34,961
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I thought you were important enough to make promises to Mrs. Savage.

685
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,761
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You get to be the one to tell her that she's a widow.

686
00:31:46,478 --> 00:31:49,961
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Is he?

687
00:31:53,807 --> 00:31:54,868
George O'Malley / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Maybe Meredith couldn't see.

688
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:55,150
George O'Malley / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Izzy.

689
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,721
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey (PVM): I'll tell him I changed my mind.

690
00:32:01,881 --> 00:32:03,702
George O'Malley / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You know, don't do me any favors.

691
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:04,183
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey (PVM): It's fine.

692
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:05,948
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Christina.

693
00:32:05,968 --> 00:32:06,248
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You know what?

694
00:32:06,268 --> 00:32:07,150
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You did a cutthroat thing.

695
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:07,651
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Deal with it.

696
00:32:08,211 --> 00:32:09,393
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Don't come to me for absolution.

697
00:32:09,413 --> 00:32:10,634
Cristina Yang / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You want to be a shark, be a shark.

698
00:32:11,695 --> 00:32:12,218
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I'm not.

699
00:32:12,376 --> 00:32:13,117
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Oh, yes, you are.

700
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,144
Cristina Yang / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Only it makes you feel all bad in your warm, gooey places.

701
00:32:17,105 --> 00:32:17,807
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey (PVM): Now, screw you.

702
00:32:18,192 --> 00:32:22,396
Izzie Stevens / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I don't get picked for surgeries because I slept with my boss and I didn't get into med school because I have a famous mother.

703
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:24,118
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): You know, some of us have to earn what we get.

704
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:39,862
Dr. Miranda Bailey / George O'Malley (PVM): Gloria, there were complications in the surgery.

705
00:32:39,922 --> 00:32:44,528
Dr. Miranda Bailey / George O'Malley (PVM): Tony's heart had a lot of damage.

706
00:32:46,068 --> 00:32:48,011
Dr. Miranda Bailey / George O'Malley (PVM): We tried to take him off bypass.

707
00:32:52,111 --> 00:32:53,412
Dr. Miranda Bailey / George O'Malley (PVM): There wasn't anything we could have done.

708
00:32:56,954 --> 00:32:57,895
Gloria: What are you talking about?

709
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,461
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Alex Karev (PVM): He... Tony died.

710
00:33:04,604 --> 00:33:05,022
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Alex Karev (PVM): He's dead.

711
00:33:07,365 --> 00:33:10,067
Dr. Miranda Bailey / Alex Karev (PVM): Gloria, I'm so sorry.

712
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:16,836
Gloria: Please.

713
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:37,320
Gloria: Oh, my God.

714
00:33:50,413 --> 00:33:51,516
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): I promised I'd make her look cool.

715
00:33:52,317 --> 00:33:55,641
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Apparently being a bald beauty queen is the worst thing that happened in the history of the world.

716
00:33:58,546 --> 00:34:00,969
Meredith Grey: Did you choose me for the surgery because I slept with you?

717
00:34:02,151 --> 00:34:02,391
Dr. Derek Shepherd: Yes.

718
00:34:06,096 --> 00:34:06,477
Dr. Derek Shepherd: I'm kidding.

719
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:09,521
Meredith Grey: I'm not going to scrub in for surgery.

720
00:34:09,862 --> 00:34:10,802
Meredith Grey: You should ask Christina.

721
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:11,664
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Meredith Grey (PVM): She really wants it.

722
00:34:11,684 --> 00:34:12,565
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Meredith Grey OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): You're Katie's doctor.

723
00:34:13,407 --> 00:34:16,530
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): And on your first day, with very little training, you helped save her life.

724
00:34:17,052 --> 00:34:20,016
Dr. Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): You earned the right to follow her case through to the finish.

725
00:34:22,072 --> 00:34:25,096
Dr. Derek Shepherd: You shouldn't let the fact that we had sex get in the way of you taking your shot.

726
00:34:39,793 --> 00:34:44,699
Dr. George O'Malley / Meredith Grey (PVM): I wish I wanted to be a chef, or a ski instructor, or a kindergarten teacher.

727
00:34:46,481 --> 00:34:48,565
Dr. George O'Malley / Alex Karev (PVM): You know, I would have been a really good postal worker.

728
00:34:50,186 --> 00:34:50,947
Dr. George O'Malley / George O'Malley (PVM): I'm dependable.

729
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:56,646
Dr. George O'Malley / George O'Malley (PVM): You know, my parents tell everyone they meet that their son's a surgeon.

730
00:34:57,447 --> 00:34:58,849
Dr. George O'Malley / George O'Malley (PVM): As if it's a big accomplishment.

731
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,753
Dr. George O'Malley / George O'Malley (PVM): Superhero or something.

732
00:35:04,677 --> 00:35:05,657

736
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:22,521

737
00:35:23,411 --> 00:35:26,135

739
00:35:40,414 --> 00:35:41,434

740
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:43,137

744
00:35:48,831 --> 00:35:50,652

746
00:35:52,255 --> 00:35:54,099

747
00:35:54,438 --> 00:35:55,099

748
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:55,581

749
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:56,601

753
00:36:13,597 --> 00:36:16,601

754
00:36:18,123 --> 00:36:21,864

00:37:54,126 --> 00:38:07,204

Meredith Grey: There comes a moment when it's more than just a game.

772
00:38:26,362 --> 00:38:36,717

774

00:39:19,072 --> 00:39:26,001

788
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:15,248

789
00:40:15,268 --> 00:40:22,114
