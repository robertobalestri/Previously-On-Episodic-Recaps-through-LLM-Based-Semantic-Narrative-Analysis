Later, Meredith leaves her car and joins the new interns at Seattle Grace Hospital.
The Chief finishes the tour, saying the next seven years will be both the best and worst of their lives.
In the locker room, Meredith connects with another intern, Cristina Yang.
They find out they have the same resident, Bailey, known as "The Nazi."
Overhearing them, George O'Malley introduces himself.
He nervously mentions meeting Meredith last night and describes her outfit but stops when they think he is gay.
The three interns, along with another intern, Isobel Stevens, an ex-model, are called to see Bailey.
They approach Bailey and are surprised she's a woman and not a Nazi.
Isobel thinks the nickname might be due to jealousy.
Cristina dismisses this, but Isobel introduces herself as Isobel Stevens, saying everyone calls her Izzie.
Bailey ignores her, shows them their equipment, gives a brief tour, and explains her rules.
She gets a page, and they all rush to the roof.
A helicopter lands with details about a patient, Katie Bryce, who is having seizures.
In the hospital, the interns and nurses inject Katie, and she stops moving.
Dr. Preston Burke arrives and compares her to a wet fish on dry land.
He instructs them to perform basic tests.

Izzie says a resident already dislikes her.
George sympathizes, saying attendings dislike him too.

Meredith quickly changes the subject, saying Katie is unbearable.
Preston Burke arrives and announces he will choose one intern for a surgery.

Burke argues that intimidating one will make the others follow, but Bailey keeps trying to change his mind.
Katie Bryce's parents enter her room and, after checking on Katie, ask Meredith if surgery is needed.
Meredith explains she isn't the doctor and goes to Bailey to find Burke.
Bailey informs her that Burke is no longer on the case and directs her to Dr. Shepherd, the new attending.
Meredith notices Dr. Shepherd, who is Derek, her one-night stand, and quickly walks away.
Derek follows her to a stairwell.
Meredith decides to act like nothing happened, but Derek jokes that she took advantage of him.
She starts to argue, but he asks if she wants to take advantage of him again next Friday.
Meredith smiles, says it's inappropriate, and walks away.
George is in the operating room.
In the gallery, other interns bet against him, but Meredith defends him.
George starts the procedure well, but at the end, he pulls the purse strings too hard and breaks them.
The patient starts to bleed, and George can't think of a solution.
Burke steps in and finishes the procedure.
The interns in the gallery nickname George "007" (license to kill).

She should start a central line but doesn't know how.
Tyler tells her to wake up Miranda Bailey, the on-call resident.
Izzie timidly approaches Bailey.
Bailey asks if the patient is dying.
When Izzie says no, Bailey goes back to sleep.
After a few seconds, Bailey gets up grumpily and starts the central line.
She tells Izzie that next time she is woken up, the patient should be near death.
Alex Karev looks at a patient's chart.
He tells the nurse the patient has pneumonia and to start antibiotics.
The nurse asks if he's sure, and he sarcastically asks if she went through four years of medical school.
He approaches Meredith and mentions he has Jeremy as his resident.
Meredith responds that the patient might not have pneumonia but could be splinting.
Alex calls her a nurse, which insults Meredith, but she has to respond to a page from Katie.
Alex asks another intern if Meredith is single, and George says they are friends.
Alex tells George to stop talking.
Meredith rushes to Katie's room and is shocked to see Katie having severe seizures.
The drugs given don't work, so she instructs a nurse to page Bailey and Shepherd.
When the drugs still fail, she uses the paddles.
On the fourth attempt, Katie's heartbeat and blood flow return to normal.
Shepherd arrives and tells Meredith to leave.

The parents want a different doctor because they feel Shepherd isn't trying hard enough.
In another part of the hospital, Burke explains a procedure to a patient.
He will put the patient on bypass, fix the heart, and finish the surgery.

Cristina, waiting for Dr. Shepherd, practices suturing on a banana.
She calls George 007 when he laughs but quickly apologizes, saying she gets mean when tired.

He mentions the intern who discovers the cause can assist in the advanced surgery.
All the interns take copies of Katie's chart.
Alex Karev approaches a nurse who confirms she paged him.
She informs him that the patient in 4B isn't responding to antibiotics, which should have worked.
Alex dismisses it, saying the patient is old, and asks not to be paged again.
Meredith walks away, and Cristina catches up to her.
Cristina suggests they work together for a better chance at the surgery.
Meredith agrees but says she doesn't want the surgery to avoid spending time with Derek.
In the hospital library, they research Katie's condition.
Cristina questions Meredith about avoiding Derek.
Meredith eventually reveals they had sex.
They return to discussing Katie when Meredith realizes something.
She tells Cristina to follow her to find Derek Shepherd.

Derek investigates and is surprised to find they were correct.
Katie is bleeding into her brain.
He notes that Katie could have lived her whole life without issues.
He praises the girls and chooses Meredith to join him in the O.R.
After he leaves, Cristina angrily looks at Meredith and walks away.
Meanwhile, Burke operates on Tony Savitch.
Later, he informs George that the operation was quick because Tony's heart was too damaged, and Tony died.
George is shocked and upset, reminding Burke he had assured Gloria that Tony would be fine.
Burke was angry and said only God could keep such a promise.
He suggested George should tell Gloria.
Izzie and Cristina were talking privately.
Izzie tried to convince Cristina that Meredith might not be at fault, but Cristina disagreed.
Meredith came in to apologize, but Cristina said Meredith shouldn't seek forgiveness from her.
Cristina added that at least she didn't get into med school because of her mother or good surgeries by sleeping with her boss.
Meredith left upset.
George was in the waiting area trying to tell Gloria that Tony had died.
He apologized, but Gloria asked him to leave and sat down in shock.
Derek was shaving Katie's head.
Meredith said she didn't want to assist, but Derek insisted.
He explained it wasn't because they had a personal relationship, but because Meredith was Katie's doctor and had helped save her life on her first day.
Meredith and George sat outside on a window ledge, wishing they had chosen different careers.
George mentioned his parents bragged about him being a surgeon.
Meredith shared that her mother tried to discourage her from medical school, doubting her abilities, so George shouldn't feel too bad.
The chief asks Alex some questions, but Alex doesn't respond.
The chief then asks the room if anyone knows the common causes of post-op fever.
When no one answers, Meredith responds.
The chief asks Meredith what she thinks is wrong with the patient.
Meredith correctly identifies patient 4B as a likely case of a pulmonary embolism.
The chief asks her how she would diagnose it, and she answers correctly again.
He instructs Alex to follow Meredith's suggestion and removes Alex from the case.
As he walks away, the chief tells Meredith he would recognize her anywhere because she looks just like her mother.
Meredith goes to the O.R.
where Katie is being prepared.

The woman asks if Meredith is her doctor.
Meredith says no, but she is a doctor.
