A woman wakes up on her couch.
She wraps a towel around herself and starts picking up her clothes.
She throws a cushion at a man, waking him up.
He sleepily hands her bra back to her.
The woman feels embarrassed and tells him to get dressed.
They chat while he puts on his clothes.
She mentions she might be late for her first day at her new job.
He compliments her house, but she clarifies it belongs to her mother and she is selling it.
He expresses sympathy, and she quickly adds that her mother is not dead.
She then suggests they skip the pretense of caring.
As she sees him off, she forgets his name.
Derek quickly tells Meredith his name.
Meredith then runs upstairs to take a shower.
Soon after, she leaves her car and joins a group of new interns at Seattle Grace Hospital.
The Chief finishes his tour by saying the next seven years will be both great and terrible for them.
In the locker room, Meredith connects with another intern named Cristina Yang.
They find out they have the same resident, Bailey, who is nicknamed "The Nazi."
While they talk, another intern introduces himself as George O'Malley.
He speaks nervously and mentions they met the night before.
He describes her outfit but stops when he realizes they think he is gay.
The three interns, along with another intern named Isobel Stevens, who is an ex-model, are then called to see Bailey.
They approach Bailey and are surprised to find she is a woman, not a Nazi.
Isobel thinks the nickname might come from professional jealousy.
Cristina laughs at this, but Isobel introduces herself as Izzie.
Bailey does not respond to the introduction.
She shows them their equipment, gives a brief tour, and explains her rules.
Then, Bailey receives a page and runs with the interns to the roof.
A helicopter lands there, bringing information about a patient named Katie Bryce, who is having seizures.
In the hospital, the interns and nurses inject Katie, and she finally stops moving.
Another doctor, Preston Burke, enters and describes Katie as a wet fish on dry land.
He instructs them to perform all the basic tests.
George is assigned to workups, Cristina to labs, and Meredith to Katie Bryce for a CT scan.
Izzie is told by a smiling Bailey to perform rectal exams.
Izzie does the rectal examinations.
Cristina receives the test results and hints to Bailey that she wants to perform surgery.
George attempts a simple procedure on a patient.
Burke, finding it frustrating, steps in to do it himself.
George jokes that Burke likely struggled at first too.
Burke smiles tightly and warns George that he will have fun with him, making George nervous.
Meanwhile, Meredith is lost in the hospital.
Katie talks non-stop about the beauty pageant she is missing.
She mentions her past success, except for when she fell during rhythmic gymnastics, and keeps reminding Meredith that she is lost.
A group of interns sits in the canteen after their first seven-hour shift.
Izzie expresses her worry about a resident who dislikes her.
George relates by saying that some attendings already hate him.
Cristina interrupts to reveal that Meredith's mother is the famous surgeon Ellis Grey, known for her amazing surgeries, books, and two Harper Avery Awards.
Meredith quickly cuts off the conversation, saying Katie is unbearable.
Preston Burke arrives at the table and announces that he can choose one intern to assist him in surgery.
He selects George for an appendectomy and then leaves.
Miranda Bailey tells Burke that O'Malley barely got into the program.
Burke believes that if he intimidates one person, the others will follow.
Bailey keeps trying to change his mind.
Katie Bryce's parents enter her room.
They check on Katie's condition and ask Meredith if she thinks Katie needs surgery.
Meredith clarifies that she is not the doctor.
She goes to find Burke but learns he is no longer on the case.
Bailey directs her to the new attending, Dr. Shepherd.
Meredith glances at Dr. Shepherd just as he looks up.
She quickly walks away because Dr. Shepherd is Derek, her one-night stand.
Derek catches up with her and pulls her into a stairwell.
Meredith decides to act like nothing happened.
Derek claims she took advantage of him.
She starts to argue but he asks if she wants to take advantage of him again next Friday.
Meredith smiles and says something is inappropriate before walking away.
George is in the operating room.
The other interns in the gallery start making bets against him, but Meredith quickly defends him.
George begins the procedure, and it goes well until the end.
He accidentally pulls the purse strings too hard and breaks them.
This causes bleeding, and he feels unsure about what to do.
After a few seconds, Burke steps in and finishes the procedure.
The interns in the gallery give George the nickname 007, meaning "license to kill."
After the procedure, George worries about this nickname.
He is being comforted when Meredith receives a page and leaves for a 911 call about Katie Bryce.
George expresses regret about not choosing geriatrics, but Cristina tells him that geriatrics is for losers who live with their mothers and have no sex.
George then quietly tells Izzie that he really needs to find a new place to live.
Meredith runs through the hospital to check on Katie.
She finds out that Katie faked a seizure and wants Meredith to call someone.
Annoyed, Meredith leaves.
Nurse Tyler sees Izzie staring and asks what she needs.
Izzie says Mr. Jones has junky veins and needs antibiotics.
She needs to start a central line but doesn't know how.
Tyler smiles and tells her to wake up Miranda Bailey, the on-call resident.
Izzie approaches Bailey timidly.
Bailey asks if the patient is dying.
When Izzie says no, Bailey goes back to sleep.
After a moment, Bailey gets up grumpily and starts the central line.
She warns Izzie that next time she is woken, the patient should be very close to death.
Another intern, Alex Karev, is looking at a patient's chart.
He tells the nurse that the patient has pneumonia and needs antibiotics.
The nurse asks if he is sure.
He sarcastically questions if she went through four years of medical school.
Alex walks over to Meredith.
He mentions that Jeremy is his resident.
Meredith responds that the patient might not have pneumonia; it could be splinting.
Alex calls her a nurse, which insults Meredith.
She has to answer a page from Katie.
Alex asks another intern if she is single.
George replies that they are friends.
Alex interrupts and tells George to stop talking.
Meredith enters Katie's room and is shocked to see her having severe seizures.
The drugs given to Katie are ineffective.
Meredith instructs a nurse to page Bailey and Shepherd.
When the drugs still do not work, she prepares the paddles.
On the fourth attempt, Katie's heartbeat and blood flow return to normal.
Shepherd arrives and tells Meredith to leave.
Bailey walks by and lectures Meredith, but she ignores her and quickly exits the hospital.
Cristina is worried as she sees Meredith vomit against a tree.
Meredith goes back into the hospital and asks Cristina not to tell anyone.
In the hospital, Shepherd tells Katie's parents that her condition might not be a seizure disorder.
The parents express their desire for a different doctor because they feel Shepherd isn't trying hard enough.
Meanwhile, Burke explains a procedure to a patient.
He tells the patient he will put him on bypass, fix his heart, and then finish.
Gloria, Tony's wife, asks if she should be worried.
Burke reassures her that he is skilled, but surgery does have risks.
After Burke leaves, Gloria remains anxious.
George comforts her and promises that Tony will do well in surgery.
While waiting for Dr. Shepherd, Cristina sutures a banana.
She jokingly calls George 007 when he laughs, but quickly apologizes, saying she becomes mean when tired.
Shepherd enters and explains that Katie is having seizures without a clear cause.
He mentions that the intern who discovers the cause will assist in the advanced surgery.
The interns take copies of Katie's chart.
Alex Karev approaches a nurse and asks if she paged him.
The nurse confirms she did and mentions that the patient in room 4B is not responding to antibiotics.
Alex dismisses her concern, stating the patient is old, and asks her not to page him again.
Meredith walks away, and Cristina runs after her.
Cristina suggests they work together to increase their chances of getting into the surgery.
Meredith agrees but says she wants to avoid spending time with Derek.
In the hospital library, they discuss Katie's condition.
Cristina asks why Meredith wants to avoid Derek.
Meredith eventually reveals that they had sex.
They return to discussing Katie, and Meredith suddenly realizes something.
She tells Cristina to get up, and they go to find Derek Shepherd.
They confront Derek and tell him that Katie might have an aneurysm, even though they lack proof.
Katie had a minor fall, which her doctor did not mention.
Derek goes to investigate and is shocked to find that they were correct; Katie is bleeding in her brain.
He explains that Katie could have lived her whole life without this being a problem and congratulates the girls.
He then chooses Meredith to assist him in the operating room.
After he leaves, Cristina glares at Meredith and storms off.
Meanwhile, Burke is performing surgery on Tony Savitch.
After some time, he finishes and goes outside to George.
George is surprised by how quickly Burke worked.
Burke explains that the heart was too damaged and Tony died.
George is shocked and upset.
He tells Burke that he had promised Gloria that Tony would be okay.
Burke is very angry.
He says only God can keep a promise like that.
He tells George he can inform Gloria.
Izzie and Cristina are alone.
Izzie tries to convince Cristina that Meredith might not be to blame.
Cristina interrupts her.
Meredith arrives and wants to apologize.
Cristina tells her she can't seek forgiveness from her.
Cristina points out that Meredith didn't get into medical school because of her mother or good surgeries from sleeping with her boss.
Meredith then leaves in anger.
George is in the waiting area.
He tries to tell Gloria that Tony has died.
He wants to apologize, but she asks him to go and then sits down heavily in a chair.
Derek is shaving Katie's head.
Meredith says she doesn't want to assist in the procedure, but Derek insists she must.
He explains that his decision is not because they had sex, but because Meredith is Katie's doctor and saved her life on her first day.
Meredith and George sit on a window ledge outside.
They both wish they had chosen different careers.
George mentions that his parents brag about him being a surgeon as if it’s a major achievement.
Meredith shares that when she told her mother about wanting to go to medical school, her mother tried to dissuade her, doubting her abilities.
She tells George he shouldn't feel too bad.
The chief asks Alex some questions.
When Alex does not respond, the chief asks the room if anyone knows the common causes of post-operative fever.
No one answers, but Meredith does.
The chief then asks her what she thinks is wrong with the patient.
Meredith correctly identifies patient 4B as likely having a pulmonary embolism.
The chief asks her how she would diagnose it, and she answers correctly again.
He tells Alex to follow Meredith's advice and then leaves the case.
As he walks away, the chief tells Meredith he would recognize her anywhere and that she looks just like her mother.
Meredith then walks to the operating room where Katie is being prepared.
She watches with admiration.
When Derek tells her to take a look, she does and is amazed.
She realizes that this is more than just a game; they are responsible for people's lives.
After the surgery, Cristina praises Meredith.
A few minutes later, they reconcile.
Soon after Cristina leaves, Derek arrives.
Meredith tells him the surgery exceeded her expectations.
They share a brief moment before Derek says he will see her later.
Later, Meredith leaves the hospital with Cristina, Izzie, and George.
Eventually, she walks up the steps of a house in the rain.
She informs a woman that she will not sell her house anymore and plans to get roommates.
Meredith mentions that her fellow interns are great.
The woman asks if Meredith is her doctor, but Meredith clarifies that she is not, although she is a doctor.
The woman then asks for Meredith's name, and Meredith reminds her.
The woman believes she used to be a doctor, and Meredith smiles, confirming that she was indeed a doctor.
The woman is named Ellis Grey.
She has Alzheimer's disease.
