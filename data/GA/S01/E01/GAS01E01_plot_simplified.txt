A woman wakes up on her couch.
She wraps a towel around herself and starts picking up her clothes.
She throws a cushion at a man, waking him up.
He sleepily hands her bra back to her.
The woman feels embarrassed and tells him to get dressed.
They chat while he puts on his clothes.
She mentions she might be late for her first day at her new job.
He compliments her house, but she clarifies it belongs to her mother, and she is selling it.
He expresses sympathy, and she quickly adds that her mother is not dead.
She then suggests they skip the pretense of caring.
As she sees him off, she forgets his name.
Derek quickly tells Meredith his name.
Meredith then goes upstairs to take a shower.
Soon after, she leaves her car and joins a group of new interns at Seattle Grace Hospital.
The Chief finishes his tour by saying the next seven years will be both great and challenging.
In the locker room, Meredith connects with another intern named Cristina Yang.
They find out they share the same resident, Bailey, who is nicknamed "The Nazi."
While they talk, another intern named George O'Malley introduces himself.
He speaks nervously and mentions meeting Meredith the night before.
He describes her outfit but stops when he realizes they think he is gay.
The four interns, including an ex-model named Isobel Stevens, are then called to see Bailey.
Bailey surprises the group by being a woman and not a Nazi.
Isobel thinks the nickname might come from professional jealousy.
Cristina laughs at this idea, but Isobel introduces herself as Izzie.
Bailey does not respond to the introduction.
Instead, she shows them their equipment, gives a brief tour, and explains her rules.
Bailey then receives a page and rushes with the interns to the roof.
A helicopter lands there, bringing information about a patient named Katie Bryce, who is having seizures.
In the hospital, the interns and nurses inject Katie, and she finally stops moving.
Another doctor, Preston Burke, enters and compares Katie to a wet fish on dry land.
He instructs the interns to perform all the basic tests.
George is assigned to workups, Cristina to labs, and Meredith to Katie Bryce for a CT scan.
Izzie is told by a smiling Bailey to perform rectal exams.
Izzie conducts rectal examinations.
Cristina receives test results and hints to Bailey about wanting a surgery.
George attempts a simple procedure on a patient.
Burke, feeling frustrated, steps in to do it himself.
George jokes that Burke likely made mistakes when he started.
Burke smiles tightly and warns George that he will have fun with him.
George swallows nervously.
Meanwhile, Meredith wanders the hospital with Katie.
Katie talks non-stop about a beauty pageant she is missing.
She mentions her past success, except for a fall during rhythmic gymnastics, and keeps reminding Meredith that she is lost.
A group of interns sits in the canteen after their first seven-hour shift.
Izzie expresses concern about a resident who dislikes her.
George relates by saying he has attendings who hate him too.
Cristina interrupts to reveal that Meredith's mother is the renowned surgeon Ellis Grey, known for her surgeries, books, and two Harper Avery Awards.
Meredith quickly cuts off the conversation, calling Katie unbearable.
Preston Burke then approaches the table.
He announces that he will choose one intern to assist him in surgery.
He selects George for an appendectomy and walks away.
Miranda Bailey tells Burke that O'Malley barely got into the program.
Burke believes that if he intimidates one person, the others will follow.
Bailey keeps trying to change his mind.
Katie Bryce's parents enter her room.
They check on her condition and then ask Meredith if Katie needs surgery.
Meredith clarifies that she is not the doctor.
She goes to find Burke but learns he is no longer on the case.
Bailey directs her to the new attending, Dr. Shepherd.
Meredith glances at Dr. Shepherd just as he looks at her.
She quickly walks away because Dr. Shepherd is Derek, her one-night stand.
Derek catches up with her and pulls her into a stairwell.
Meredith decides to act like nothing happened.
Derek claims she took advantage of him.
She starts to argue but he interrupts and asks if she wants to take advantage of him again next Friday.
Meredith smiles and finds the situation inappropriate, then walks away.
George is in the operating room.
The other interns in the gallery start betting against him, but Meredith quickly defends him.
George begins the procedure, and it goes well until the end.
He accidentally pulls the purse strings too hard and breaks them.
This causes bleeding, and he feels unsure about what to do.
After a few seconds, Burke steps in and finishes the procedure.
The interns in the gallery give George the nickname 007, meaning "license to kill."
After the procedure, George worries about this nickname.
He is being comforted when Meredith receives a page for a 911 case involving Katie Bryce and leaves.
George expresses regret about not choosing geriatrics.
Cristina responds that geriatrics is for people who never have sex and live with their mothers.
George then quietly tells Izzie that he really needs to find a new place to live.
Meredith runs through the hospital to check on Katie.
Katie faked a seizure and wants Meredith to call someone.
Annoyed, Meredith leaves.
Nurse Tyler sees Izzie staring and asks what she needs.
Izzie says Mr. Jones has junky veins and needs antibiotics.
She should start a central line but doesn't know how.
Tyler smiles and tells her to wake up Miranda Bailey, the on-call resident.
Izzie approaches Bailey timidly.
Bailey asks if the patient is dying.
When Izzie says no, Bailey goes back to sleep.
After a moment, Bailey gets up grumpily and starts the central line.
She warns Izzie that next time she is woken up, the patient should be near death.
Another intern, Alex Karev, looks at a patient's chart.
He tells the nurse they have pneumonia and to start the antibiotics.
The nurse asks if he is sure.
He sarcastically replies, questioning if she went through four years of medical school.
Alex approaches Meredith and mentions that Jeremy is his resident.
Meredith responds that the patient might not have pneumonia; it could be splinting.
Alex calls her a nurse, which offends Meredith.
She has to answer a page from Katie.
Alex asks another intern if she is single, but George says they are just friends.
Alex interrupts and tells George to stop talking.
Meredith enters Katie's room and is shocked to see her having severe seizures.
The medication given did not work, so she instructs a nurse to page Bailey and Shepherd.
When the drugs still fail, she prepares the paddles.
On the fourth attempt, Katie's heartbeat and blood flow return to normal.
Shepherd arrives and tells Meredith to leave.
Bailey walks by and lectures Meredith, but she ignores her and quickly exits the hospital.
Cristina is worried as she watches Meredith vomit against a tree.
Meredith then goes back into the hospital and asks Cristina to keep it a secret.
In the hospital, which is now 24 hours into the shift, Shepherd tells Katie's parents that her condition might not be a seizure disorder.
The parents express their desire for another doctor because they feel Shepherd isn't putting in enough effort.
Meanwhile, Burke is explaining a procedure to a patient.
He tells the patient he will put him on bypass, fix his heart, and then finish.
Gloria, who is Tony's wife, asks if she should be concerned.
Burke reassures her that he is skilled, but he acknowledges that surgery carries risks.
After Burke leaves, Gloria remains anxious.
George comforts her and assures her that Tony will do well during the surgery.
While waiting for Dr. Shepherd, Cristina is impatient and sutures a banana.
She jokingly calls George "007" when he laughs, but then apologizes, explaining that she becomes mean when she is tired.
Shepherd enters and explains that Katie is having seizures without a clear cause.
He mentions that the intern who discovers the cause will assist in the advanced surgery.
All the interns take copies of Katie's chart.
Alex Karev approaches a nurse and asks if she paged him.
The nurse confirms she did and mentions that the patient in room 4B is not responding to antibiotics.
Alex dismisses her concern, stating the patient is old, and asks her not to page him again.
Meredith walks away, and Cristina runs after her.
Cristina suggests they work together to increase their chances of getting into the surgery.
Meredith agrees but says she wants to avoid spending time with Derek.
In the hospital library, they try to figure out Katie's condition.
Cristina asks Meredith why she avoids Derek.
Eventually, Meredith reveals that they had sex.
They return to discussing Katie when Meredith has a realization.
She tells Cristina to get up, and they go to find Derek Shepherd.
They tell Derek that Katie might have an aneurysm, even though they have no proof.
Katie fell, but her doctor did not mention the fall because it was minor.
Derek checks on Katie and is shocked to find that she is bleeding in her brain.
He explains that Katie could have lived her whole life without this being a problem.
He congratulates the girls for their concern.
Derek then chooses Meredith to assist him in the operating room.
After he leaves, Cristina glares at Meredith and walks away angrily.
Meanwhile, Burke is operating on Tony Savitch.
After some time, he finishes and goes to talk to George.
George is surprised by how quickly Burke worked.
Burke explains that the heart was too damaged and Tony died.
George is shocked and upset.
He reminds Burke that he had promised Gloria that Tony would be okay.
Burke is very angry.
He says only God can keep a promise like that.
He tells George he can inform Gloria.
Izzie and Cristina are alone.
Izzie tries to convince Cristina that Meredith might not be to blame.
Cristina interrupts her.
Meredith arrives and tries to apologize.
Cristina tells Meredith she can't seek forgiveness from her.
Cristina points out that Meredith didn't get into medical school because of her mother or good surgeries from sleeping with her boss.
Meredith then leaves in anger.
George is in the waiting area.
He tries to tell Gloria that Tony has died.
He wants to apologize, but she asks him to go and then sits down heavily.
Derek is shaving Katie's head.
Meredith says she doesn't want to assist, but Derek insists she should.
He explains that his decision was not because they had sex, but because Meredith is Katie's doctor and saved her life on her first day.
Meredith and George sit on a window ledge outside.
They both wish they had chosen different careers.
George mentions that his parents tell everyone he is a surgeon as if it is a great achievement.
Meredith shares that when she told her mother she wanted to go to medical school, her mother tried to dissuade her, thinking she wasn't capable.
She tells George he shouldn't feel too bad.
The chief asks Alex some questions.
When Alex does not respond, the chief asks the room if anyone knows the common causes of post-operative fever.
Nobody answers, but Meredith does.
The chief asks her what she thinks is wrong with the patient.
Meredith correctly identifies patient 4B as likely having a pulmonary embolism.
The chief then asks her how she would diagnose it, and she answers correctly again.
The chief tells Alex to follow Meredith's advice and then leaves the case.
As he walks away, he tells Meredith that he recognizes her and that she looks just like her mother.
Meredith then goes to the operating room where Katie is being prepared.
She watches with admiration.
When Derek tells her to take a look, she does and is amazed.
She realizes that this is more than just a game; they are responsible for people's lives.
After the surgery, Cristina praises Meredith.
A few minutes later, they reconcile.
Soon after Cristina leaves, Derek arrives.
Meredith tells him the surgery exceeded her expectations.
They share a moment before Derek says he will see her later.
Later, Meredith leaves the hospital with Cristina, Izzie, and George.
She then walks up the steps of a house in the rain.
She informs a woman that she will not sell her house and plans to get roommates.
The woman asks if Meredith is her doctor, but Meredith clarifies that she is not, though she is a doctor.
The woman asks for Meredith's name, and Meredith reminds her.
The woman then mentions she thinks she used to be a doctor.
Meredith smiles and confirms that the woman was indeed a doctor.
The woman is named Ellis Grey.
She has Alzheimer's disease.
