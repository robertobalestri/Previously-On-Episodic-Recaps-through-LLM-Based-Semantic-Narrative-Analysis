A woman wakes up on her couch.
She wraps a towel around herself and starts picking up her clothes.
She throws a cushion at a man.
The man wakes up slowly and hands her her bra.

While he gets dressed, they talk briefly.
The woman says she will be late for her first day at a new job.
The man compliments her house.
She explains that the house belonged to her mother and she is selling it.
The man apologizes, thinking her mother is dead.
She quickly says her mother is alive.
She tells him they do not need to pretend to care about each other.
She goes to see him out but forgets his name.
The man says his name is Derek.
She says her name is Meredith.
Meredith then runs upstairs to take a shower.
Later, Meredith leaves her car and joins a group of new interns at Seattle Grace Hospital.
The Chief finishes a tour and tells the interns that the next seven years will be both the best and worst of their lives.
In the locker room, Meredith talks with another intern named Cristina Yang.
They find out they have the same resident, Bailey, who is called "The Nazi."
Another intern, George O'Malley, hears them and introduces himself.
George nervously tells Meredith they met the night before and describes her clothes.
He stops when he realizes the others think he is gay.
The three interns, along with another intern named Isobel Stevens, are called to meet Bailey.
The interns walk up to Bailey and are surprised to see she is a woman.
Isobel suggests the nickname "The Nazi" might be due to professional jealousy.
Cristina does not agree, but Isobel introduces herself to Bailey and says people call her Izzie.
Bailey ignores the introduction.
She shows the interns their equipment, gives them a short tour, and explains her rules.
Bailey then gets a page and leads the interns to the roof.
On the roof, a helicopter lands and brings a patient named Katie Bryce, who is having seizures.
Inside the hospital, the interns and nurses give Katie an injection, and she stops moving.
Another doctor, Preston Burke, enters and compares Katie to a wet fish on dry land.
He tells the interns to run basic tests.
George is told to do work ups.
Cristina is assigned to do labs.
Meredith is told to take care of Katie Bryce and get her a CT scan.

George jokes that Burke probably made mistakes when he started too.
Burke forces a smile and tells George he will enjoy working with him.
George becomes nervous.
Meredith is wandering around the hospital with Katie.
Katie keeps talking about the beauty pageant she is missing.
She says she was good at it except for falling during rhythmic gymnastics.
Katie also tells Meredith that she is lost.
A group of interns sit in the canteen after seven hours of their first shift.
Izzie says she is in trouble because a resident already dislikes her.
George says that some attendings already dislike him too.
Cristina interrupts and asks if anyone knows that Meredith’s mother is Ellis Grey, a famous surgeon who wrote books and won the Harper Avery Award twice.
Meredith quickly changes the subject and says Katie is unbearable.
Preston Burke comes to the table and announces he will choose one intern to assist him in surgery.
He picks George to help with an appendectomy and leaves.
Miranda Bailey complains to Burke about his choice, saying O’Malley barely got into the program.
Burke says that if he is tough on one intern, the others will behave.
Bailey keeps trying to change his mind.
Katie Bryce’s parents visit her room.
They check if Katie is okay and ask Meredith if Katie needs surgery.
Meredith explains she is not the doctor.
She goes to Bailey to find Burke, but Bailey says Burke is no longer on the case.
Bailey tells Meredith that Dr. Shepherd is now in charge.
Meredith looks at Dr. Shepherd, who is actually Derek, her one-night stand.
Meredith quickly walks away.
Derek follows her and pulls her into a stairwell.
Meredith decides to act like nothing happened.
Derek jokes that Meredith took advantage of him.
Meredith starts to argue, but Derek asks if she wants to see him again next Friday.

George is in the operating room.
The other interns watch from the gallery and start betting against him.
Meredith defends George.
George begins the procedure and does well until the end, when he pulls the purse strings too hard and breaks them.
The patient starts to bleed.
George freezes and does not know what to do.
Burke steps in, pushes George aside, and finishes the surgery.
The interns in the gallery give George the nickname "007," meaning "license to kill."
After the surgery, George worries about his new nickname.
The other interns try to comfort him.
Meredith is paged for a 911 call about Katie Bryce and leaves.
George says he should have chosen geriatrics.
Cristina says geriatrics is for people who never have sex and live with their mothers.
George quietly tells Izzie that he needs to find a new place to live.
Meredith runs through the hospital to check on Katie.
She finds out that Katie faked a seizure and wants Meredith to call someone.
Meredith gets annoyed and leaves the room.
Nurse Tyler sees Izzie staring and asks what she needs.
Izzie explains that Mr. Jones has bad veins and needs antibiotics.
She says she should start a central line but does not know how.
Tyler smiles and tells her that since Miranda Bailey is the on-call resident, Izzie must wake her up.
Izzie walks timidly to Bailey, who is sleeping.
Bailey asks if the patient is dying.
When Izzie says no, Bailey goes back to sleep.
After a few seconds, Bailey gets up grumpily and starts the central line for Mr. Jones.
Bailey tells Izzie that next time she is woken up, the patient should be almost dead.
Alex Karev, another intern, looks at a patient's chart.
He tells the nurse that the patient has pneumonia and to start antibiotics.

Alex asks another intern if Meredith is single.
George says they are friends.
Alex tells George to stop talking.
Meredith runs to Katie's room and finds Katie having real, severe seizures.
The drugs given do not help, so Meredith tells a nurse to page Bailey and Shepherd.
When the drugs still do not work, Meredith uses the paddles to try to restart Katie's heart.
On the fourth attempt, Katie's heartbeat and blood flow return to normal.
Shepherd arrives and tells Meredith to leave the room.
Bailey walks by and lectures Meredith, but Meredith ignores her and walks quickly out of the hospital.

In another part of the hospital, Burke explains a procedure to a patient.
He says he will put the patient on bypass, fix his heart, and then finish the surgery.
Gloria, the patient's wife, asks if she should worry.
Burke assures her that he is skilled, but surgery always has risks.
Burke leaves, but Gloria is still worried.
George tries to comfort her and promises that Tony will be fine during surgery.
While waiting for Dr. Shepherd, Cristina sutures a banana.
George laughs, and Cristina calls him 007.
She quickly apologizes and says she gets mean when she is tired.

All the interns take copies of Katie’s chart to investigate.
Alex Karev approaches a nurse and asks if she paged him.
The nurse confirms and explains that the patient in room 4B is not responding to antibiotics, even though they should have worked by now.
Alex ignores her concern, says the patient is old, and tells the nurse not to page him again.
Meredith walks away.
Cristina catches up to her and suggests they work together so each has a better chance of being chosen for the surgery.

Burke explains that Tony’s heart was too damaged and Tony died.
George is upset because he had promised Tony’s wife, Gloria, that Tony would survive.
Burke becomes angry and tells George that only God can make such promises.
Burke also tells George that he must be the one to inform Gloria.
Izzie and Cristina sit together in private.
Izzie tries to comfort Cristina and suggests that Meredith is not to blame.

Meredith leaves angrily.
George waits in the waiting area and tries to tell Gloria that Tony has died.
He tries to apologize, but Gloria asks him to leave and sits down in shock.

Meredith tells Derek she does not want to assist in the surgery.
Derek insists that she must, explaining that he chose her because she was Katie’s doctor and helped save her life on her first day, not because of their personal relationship.
Later, Meredith and George sit together outside on a window ledge.
They both wish they had chosen different careers.
George says his parents tell everyone he is a surgeon as if it is a great achievement.
