  "Here is the analysis of the segments according to your guidelines: **Segment 1:**",
  "Meredith wakes up on Meredith's couch. Meredith wraps a towel around Meredith and starts picking up Meredith's clothes. Meredith throws a cushion at Derek. Derek wakes up slowly and hands Meredith Meredith's bra. Meredith feels embarrassed and tells Derek to get dressed. While Derek gets dressed, Meredith and Derek talk briefly. Meredith says Meredith will be late for Meredith's first day at a new job. Derek compliments Meredith's house. Meredith explains that the house belonged to Meredith's mother and Meredith is selling it. Derek apologizes, thinking Meredith's mother is dead. Meredith quickly says Meredith's mother is alive. Meredith tells Derek they do not need to pretend to care about each other. Meredith goes to see Derek out but forgets Derek's name. Derek says Derek's name is Derek. Meredith says Meredith's name is Meredith. Meredith then runs upstairs to take a shower. **Analysis:** All of this takes place in Meredith's house, in a continuous narrative, with no major time or location shift. The focus is on the aftermath of the night before and their awkward interaction. The scene ends when Meredith runs upstairs to take a shower, which is a natural endpoint. **Correction:** No correction needed. --- **Segment 2:**",
  "Later, Meredith leaves Meredith's car and joins a group of new interns at Seattle Grace Hospital. The Chief finishes a tour and tells the interns that the next seven years will be both the best and worst of the interns' lives. **Analysis:** \"Later\" and the change of location (from home to hospital) indicate a new scene. **Correction:** No correction needed. --- **Segment 3:**",
  "In the locker room, Meredith talks with another intern named Cristina Yang. Meredith and Cristina find out Meredith and Cristina have the same resident, Bailey, who is called \"The Nazi.\" Another intern, George O'Malley, hears Meredith and Cristina and introduces himself. George nervously tells Meredith that George and Meredith met the night before and describes Meredith's clothes. George stops when George realizes Cristina and Meredith think George is gay. **Analysis:** All takes place in the locker room, same time, same narrative focus. **Correction:** No correction needed. --- **Segment 4:**",
  "Meredith, Cristina, George, along with another intern named Isobel Stevens, are called to meet Bailey. Meredith, Cristina, George, and Isobel walk up to Bailey and are surprised to see Bailey is a woman. Isobel suggests the nickname \"The Nazi\" might be due to professional jealousy. Cristina does not agree, but Isobel introduces Isobel to Bailey and says people call Isobel Izzie. Bailey ignores the introduction. Bailey shows the interns their equipment, gives the interns a short tour, and explains Bailey's rules. Bailey then gets a page and leads the interns to the roof. **Analysis:** This segment is a continuous event: meeting Bailey, getting a tour, and being led to the roof. The scene ends when they are led to the roof, which is a new location and likely a new scene. **Correction:** No correction needed. --- **Segment 5:**",
  "On the roof, a helicopter lands and brings a patient named Katie Bryce, who is having seizures. **Analysis:** New location (roof), new event (arrival of patient). This is a valid, short scene. **Correction:** No correction needed. --- **Segment 6:**",
  "Inside the hospital, the interns and nurses give Katie Bryce an injection, and Katie Bryce stops moving. Preston Burke enters and compares Katie Bryce to a wet fish on dry land. Preston Burke tells the interns to run basic tests. George is told to do work ups. Cristina is assigned to do labs. Meredith is told to take care of Katie Bryce and get Katie Bryce a CT scan. Bailey tells Izzie to perform rectal exams. Izzie does the rectal exams. Cristina collects test results and hints to Bailey that Cristina wants to do a surgery. **Analysis:** All takes place inside the hospital, continuous action with Katie Bryce and the interns. **Correction:** No correction needed. --- **Segment 7:**",
  "George tries to do a simple procedure on a patient. Preston Burke gets frustrated, pushes George aside, and does the procedure himself. George jokes that Preston Burke probably made mistakes when Preston Burke started too. Preston Burke forces a smile and tells George Preston Burke will enjoy working with George. George becomes nervous. **Analysis:** This is a focused event: George's attempt at a procedure and its aftermath. **Correction:** No correction needed. --- **Segment 8:**",
  "Meredith is wandering around the hospital with Katie Bryce. Katie Bryce keeps talking about the beauty pageant Katie Bryce is missing. Katie Bryce says Katie Bryce was good at it except for falling during rhythmic gymnastics. Katie Bryce also tells Meredith that Katie Bryce is lost. **Analysis:** Continuous action, same characters, same location. **Correction:** No correction needed. --- **Segment 9:**",
  "A group of interns sit in the canteen after seven hours of the interns' first shift. Izzie says Izzie is in trouble because a resident already dislikes Izzie. George says that some attendings already dislike George too. Cristina interrupts and asks if anyone knows that Meredith's mother is Ellis Grey, a famous surgeon who wrote books and won the Harper Avery Award twice. Meredith quickly changes the subject and says Katie Bryce is unbearable. **Analysis:** New location (canteen), new time (after seven hours), new narrative focus (interns' relationships and Meredith's mother). **Correction:** No correction needed. --- **Segment 10:**",
  "Preston Burke comes to the table and announces Preston Burke will choose one intern to assist Preston Burke in surgery. Preston Burke picks George to help with an appendectomy and leaves. **Analysis:** This is a new event (Burke's announcement), but it happens in the same location and time as the previous segment. According to the guideline \"Only one major event or action usually happens per scene,\" this could be merged with the previous canteen scene, as the focus is still on the group of interns and their interactions. **Correction:** **Merge Segment 10 with Segment 9:**",
  "A group of interns sit in the canteen after seven hours of the interns' first shift. Izzie says Izzie is in trouble because a resident already dislikes Izzie.

Meredith quickly changes the subject and says Katie Bryce is unbearable. Preston Burke comes to the table and announces Preston Burke will choose one intern to assist Preston Burke in surgery. Preston Burke picks George to help with an appendectomy and leaves. --- **Segment 11:**",
  "Miranda Bailey complains to Preston Burke about Preston Burke's choice, saying O'Malley barely got into the program. Preston Burke says that if Preston Burke is tough on one intern, the others will behave. Miranda Bailey keeps trying to change Preston Burke's mind. **Analysis:** New location (presumably elsewhere in the hospital), new characters (Burke and Bailey), new narrative focus. **Correction:** No correction needed. --- **Segment 12:**",
  "Katie Bryce's parents visit Katie Bryce's room. Katie Bryce's parents check if Katie Bryce is okay and ask Meredith if Katie Bryce needs surgery. Meredith explains Meredith is not the doctor. Meredith goes to Bailey to find Preston Burke, but Bailey says Preston Burke is no longer on the case. Bailey tells Meredith that Dr. Shepherd is now in charge. Meredith looks at Dr. Shepherd, who is actually Derek, Meredith's one-night stand. Meredith quickly walks away. Derek follows Meredith and pulls Meredith into a stairwell. Meredith decides to act like nothing happened. Derek jokes that Meredith took advantage of Derek. Meredith starts to argue, but Derek asks Meredith if Meredith wants to see Derek again next Friday. Meredith smiles, says it is inappropriate, and leaves. **Analysis:** This segment contains two major events: 1. Katie Bryce's parents visit and the handoff to Dr. Shepherd. 2. Meredith and Derek's stairwell conversation. According to the guidelines, a new scene should start with a major change in location or narrative focus. The stairwell conversation is a substantial shift in narrative focus and location. **Correction:** **Split Segment 12 into two scenes:**",

George begins the procedure and does well until the end, when George pulls the purse strings too hard and breaks them. The patient starts to bleed. George freezes and does not know what to do. Preston Burke steps in, pushes George aside, and finishes the surgery. The interns in the gallery give George the nickname \"007,\" meaning \"license to kill.\" **Analysis:** Single event, focused on George's surgery. **Correction:** No correction needed. --- **Segment 14:**",
  "After the surgery, George worries about the new nickname \"007.\" The other interns try to comfort George. Meredith is paged for a 911 call about Katie Bryce and leaves. George says George should have chosen geriatrics. Cristina says geriatrics is for people who never have sex and live with their mothers. George quietly tells Izzie that George needs to find a new place to live. **Analysis:** New time (after surgery), new location (not specified but presumably not the OR), new narrative focus. **Correction:** No correction needed. --- **Segment 15:**",
  "Meredith runs through the hospital to check on Katie Bryce. Meredith finds out that Katie Bryce faked a seizure and wants Meredith to call someone. Meredith gets annoyed and leaves the room. **Analysis:** New event, new focus. **Correction:** No correction needed. --- ## **Corrected Segments**",

  "Nurse Tyler sees Izzie staring and asks what Izzie needs. Izzie explains that Mr. Jones has bad veins and needs antibiotics. Izzie says Izzie should start a central line but does not know how. Tyler smiles and tells Izzie that since Miranda Bailey is the on-call resident, Izzie must wake Miranda Bailey up. Izzie walks timidly to Miranda Bailey, who is sleeping. Miranda Bailey asks Izzie if Mr. Jones is dying. When Izzie says no, Miranda Bailey goes back to sleep. After a few seconds, Miranda Bailey gets up grumpily and starts the central line for Mr. Jones.
