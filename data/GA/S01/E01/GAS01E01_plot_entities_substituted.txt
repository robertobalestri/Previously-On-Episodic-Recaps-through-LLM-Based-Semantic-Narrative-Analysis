Overhearing them, [george_omalley] introduces himself.
[george_omalley] nervously mentions meeting [meredith_grey] last night and describes [meredith_grey]'s outfit but stops when [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] think [george_omalley] is gay.
The three interns, along with another intern, [isobel_stevens], an ex-model, are called to see [miranda_bailey].
They approach [miranda_bailey] and are surprised she's a woman and not a Nazi.
[isobel_stevens] thinks the nickname might be due to jealousy.
[cristina_yang] dismisses this, but Isobel introduces herself as [isobel_stevens], saying everyone calls her [isobel_stevens].

[george_omalley] sympathizes, saying attendings dislike him too.

[meredith_grey] quickly changes the subject, saying [katie_bryce] is unbearable.
[dr_preston_burke] arrives and announces he will choose one intern for a surgery.
He picks [george_omalley] for an appendectomy and leaves.
[miranda_bailey] tells [dr_preston_burke] she disagrees with his decision, mentioning that [george_omalley] barely got into the program.
[dr_preston_burke] argues that intimidating one will make the others follow, but [miranda_bailey] keeps trying to change his mind.

[miranda_bailey] informs her that [dr_preston_burke] is no longer on the case and directs her to [derek_shepherd], the new attending.

[meredith_grey] returns to the hospital and asks [cristina_yang] to keep it a secret.
Inside the hospital, [derek_shepherd] tells [katie_bryce]'s parents that it might not be a seizure disorder.

In another part of the hospital, [dr_preston_burke] explains a procedure to a patient.

[meredith_grey] walks away, and [cristina_yang] catches up to [meredith_grey].
[cristina_yang] suggests they work together for a better chance at the surgery.

[dr_preston_burke] suggests [george_omalley] should tell [gloria_savitch].
[isobel_stevens] and [cristina_yang] are talking privately.
[isobel_stevens] tries to convince [cristina_yang] that [meredith_grey] might not be at fault, but [cristina_yang] disagrees.
[meredith_grey] comes in to apologize, but [cristina_yang] says [meredith_grey] shouldn't seek forgiveness from her.
[cristina_yang] adds that at least she didn't get into med school because of her mother or good surgeries by sleeping with her boss.
[meredith_grey] leaves upset.
[george_omalley] is in the waiting area trying to tell [gloria_savitch] that [tony_savitch] has died.
[george_omalley] apologizes, but [gloria_savitch] asks him to leave and sits down in shock.
[derek_shepherd] is shaving [katie_bryce]'s head.
[meredith_grey] says she doesn't want to assist, but [derek_shepherd] insists.
[derek_shepherd] explains it isn't because they have a personal relationship, but because [meredith_grey] is [katie_bryce]'s doctor and helped save her life on her first day.
[meredith_grey] and [george_omalley] sit outside on a window ledge, wishing they had chosen different careers.
[george_omalley] mentions his parents brag about him being a surgeon.
[meredith_grey] shared that her mother tried to discourage her from medical school, doubting [meredith_grey]'s abilities, so [george_omalley] shouldn't feel too bad.
The chief asks [alex_karev] some questions, but [alex_karev] doesn't respond.
The chief then asks the room if anyone knows the common causes of post-op fever.
When no one answers, [meredith_grey] responds.
The chief asks [meredith_grey] what she thinks is wrong with the patient.
[meredith_grey] correctly identifies patient 4B as a likely case of a pulmonary embolism.
The chief asks [meredith_grey] how she would diagnose it, and she answers correctly again.
The chief instructs [alex_karev] to follow [meredith_grey]'s suggestion and removes [alex_karev] from the case.
As the chief walks away, he tells [meredith_grey] he would recognize her anywhere because she looks just like her mother.
[meredith_grey] goes to the O.R. where [katie_bryce] is being prepared.
[meredith_grey] watches with admiration.

[derek_shepherd] and [meredith_grey] share a moment, and [derek_shepherd] says he will see [meredith_grey] around before leaving.
Later, [meredith_grey] leaves the hospital with [cristina_yang], [isobel_stevens], and [george_omalley].
[meredith_grey] eventually goes to a house in the rain.
[meredith_grey] tells [ellis_grey] she won't sell the house, plans to get roommates, and mentions her fellow interns are great.
[ellis_grey] asks if [meredith_grey] is her doctor.
[meredith_grey] says no, but she is a doctor.
