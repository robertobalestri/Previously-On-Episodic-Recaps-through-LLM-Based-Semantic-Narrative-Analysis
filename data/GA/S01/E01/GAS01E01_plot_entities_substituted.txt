[meredith_grey] wakes up on her couch.
[meredith_grey] wraps a towel around herself and starts picking up her clothes.
[meredith_grey] throws a cushion at [dr_derek_shepherd], waking him up.
[dr_derek_shepherd] sleepily hands [meredith_grey] her bra back.
[meredith_grey] feels embarrassed and tells [dr_derek_shepherd] to get dressed.
[meredith_grey] and [dr_derek_shepherd] chat while [dr_derek_shepherd] puts on his clothes.
[meredith_grey] mentions she might be late for her first day at her new job.
[dr_derek_shepherd] compliments [meredith_grey]'s house, but [meredith_grey] clarifies it belongs to her mother and she is selling it.
[dr_derek_shepherd] expresses sympathy, and [meredith_grey] quickly adds that her mother is not dead.
[meredith_grey] then suggests they skip the pretense of caring.
As [meredith_grey] sees [dr_derek_shepherd] off, she forgets [dr_derek_shepherd]'s name.
[dr_derek_shepherd] quickly tells [meredith_grey] his name.
[meredith_grey] then runs upstairs to take a shower.
Soon after, [meredith_grey] leaves her car and joins a group of new interns at Seattle Grace Hospital.
The Chief finishes his tour by saying the next seven years will be both great and terrible for the interns.
In the locker room, [meredith_grey] connects with another intern named [cristina_yang].
[meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] find out they have the same resident, Bailey, who is nicknamed "The Nazi."
While they talk, another intern introduces himself as [george_omalley].
[george_omalley] speaks nervously and mentions that he met [meredith_grey] the night before.
[george_omalley] describes [meredith_grey]'s outfit but stops when he realizes that [cristina_yang] and [izzie_stevens] Stevens think he is gay.
The three interns, along with [izzie_stevens] Stevens, who is an ex-model, are then called to see [miranda_bailey].
[george_omalley], [cristina_yang], and [izzie_stevens] approach [miranda_bailey] and are surprised to find that Miranda is a woman, not a Nazi.
[izzie_stevens] thinks the nickname might come from professional jealousy.
[cristina_yang] laughs at this, but [izzie_stevens] introduces herself as [izzie_stevens].
[miranda_bailey] does not respond to the introduction.
Miranda shows the interns their equipment, gives a brief tour, and explains her rules.
Then, Miranda receives a page and runs with the interns to the roof.
A helicopter lands there, bringing information about a patient named [katie_bryce], who is having seizures.
In the hospital, the interns and nurses inject [katie_bryce], and she finally stops moving.
Another doctor, [preston_burke], enters and describes [katie_bryce] as a wet fish on dry land.
Preston instructs the interns to perform all the basic tests.
[george_omalley] is assigned to workups, [cristina_yang] to labs, and [meredith_grey] to [katie_bryce] for a CT scan.
[izzie_stevens] is told by a smiling Miranda to perform rectal exams.
[izzie_stevens] does the rectal examinations.
[cristina_yang] receives the test results and hints to Miranda that she wants to perform surgery.
[george_omalley] attempts a simple procedure on a patient.
[preston_burke], finding it frustrating, steps in to do it himself.
[george_omalley] jokes that [preston_burke] likely struggled at first too.
[preston_burke] smiles tightly and warns [george_omalley] that he will have fun with [george_omalley], making [george_omalley] nervous.
Meanwhile, [meredith_grey] is lost in the hospital.
[katie_bryce] talks non-stop about the beauty pageant [katie_bryce] is missing.
[katie_bryce] mentions [katie_bryce]'s past success, except for when [katie_bryce] fell during rhythmic gymnastics, and keeps reminding [meredith_grey] that [meredith_grey] is lost.
A group of interns sits in the canteen after the interns' first seven-hour shift.
[izzie_stevens] expresses [izzie_stevens]'s worry about a resident who dislikes [izzie_stevens].
[george_omalley] relates by saying that some attendings already hate [george_omalley].
[cristina_yang] interrupts to reveal that [ellis_grey] is the famous surgeon [ellis_grey], known for her amazing surgeries, books, and two Harper Avery Awards.
[meredith_grey] quickly cuts off the conversation, saying [katie_bryce] is unbearable.
[preston_burke] arrives at the table and announces that he can choose one intern to assist him in surgery.
[preston_burke] selects [george_omalley] for an appendectomy and then leaves.
[miranda_bailey] tells [preston_burke] that [george_omalley] barely got into the program.
[preston_burke] believes that if he intimidates one person, the others will follow.
Bailey keeps trying to change [preston_burke]'s mind.
[katie_bryce]'s parents enter [katie_bryce]'s room.
[katie_bryce]'s parents check on [katie_bryce]'s condition and ask [meredith_grey] if [meredith_grey] thinks [katie_bryce] needs surgery.
[meredith_grey] clarifies that [meredith_grey] is not the doctor. [meredith_grey] goes to find [preston_burke] but learns [preston_burke] is no longer on the case. [miranda_bailey] directs [meredith_grey] to the new attending, [dr_derek_shepherd]. [meredith_grey] glances at [dr_derek_shepherd] just as [dr_derek_shepherd] looks up. [meredith_grey] quickly walks away because [dr_derek_shepherd] is [dr_derek_shepherd], [meredith_grey]'s one-night stand. [dr_derek_shepherd] catches up with [meredith_grey] and pulls [meredith_grey] into a stairwell. [meredith_grey] decides to act like nothing happened. [dr_derek_shepherd] claims [meredith_grey] took advantage of him. [meredith_grey] starts to argue, but [dr_derek_shepherd] asks if [meredith_grey] wants to take advantage of him again next Friday. [meredith_grey] smiles and says something is inappropriate before walking away. [george_omalley] is in the operating room. The other interns in the gallery start making bets against [george_omalley], but [meredith_grey] quickly defends [george_omalley]. [george_omalley] begins the procedure, and it goes well until the end. [george_omalley] accidentally pulls the purse strings too hard and breaks them. This causes bleeding, and [george_omalley] feels unsure about what to do. After a few seconds, [preston_burke] steps in and finishes the procedure. The interns in the gallery give [george_omalley] the nickname 007, meaning "license to kill." After the procedure, [george_omalley] worries about this nickname.
[george_omalley] is being comforted when [meredith_grey] receives a page and leaves for a 911 call about [katie_bryce].
[george_omalley] expresses regret about not choosing geriatrics, but [cristina_yang] tells [george_omalley] that geriatrics is for losers who live with their mothers and have no sex.
[george_omalley] then quietly tells [izzie_stevens] that [george_omalley] really needs to find a new place to live.
[meredith_grey] runs through the hospital to check on [katie_bryce].
[meredith_grey] finds out that [katie_bryce] faked a seizure and wants [meredith_grey] to call someone.
Annoyed, [meredith_grey] leaves.
Nurse [tyler] sees [izzie_stevens] staring and asks [izzie_stevens] what [izzie_stevens] needs.
[izzie_stevens] says [mr_jones] has junky veins and needs antibiotics.
[izzie_stevens] needs to start a central line but doesn't know how.
[tyler] smiles and tells [izzie_stevens] to wake up [miranda_bailey], the on-call resident.
[izzie_stevens] approaches [miranda_bailey] timidly.
[miranda_bailey] asks if the patient is dying.
When [izzie_stevens] says no, [miranda_bailey] goes back to sleep.
After a moment, [miranda_bailey] gets up grumpily and starts the central line.
[miranda_bailey] warns [izzie_stevens] that next time [miranda_bailey] is woken, the patient should be very close to death.
Another intern, [alex_karev], is looking at a patient's chart.
[alex_karev] tells the nurse that the patient has pneumonia and needs antibiotics.
The nurse asks [alex_karev] if [alex_karev] is sure.
[alex_karev] sarcastically questions if [meredith_grey] went through four years of medical school.
[alex_karev] walks over to [meredith_grey].
[alex_karev] mentions that [jeremy] is [alex_karev]'s resident.
[meredith_grey] responds that the patient might not have pneumonia; it could be splinting.
[alex_karev] calls [meredith_grey] a nurse, which insults [meredith_grey].
[meredith_grey] has to answer a page from [katie_bryce].
[alex_karev] asks another intern if she is single.
[george_omalley] replies that they are friends.
[alex_karev] interrupts and tells [george_omalley] to stop talking.
[meredith_grey] enters [katie_bryce]'s room and is shocked to see [katie_bryce] having severe seizures.
The drugs given to [katie_bryce] are ineffective.
[meredith_grey] instructs a nurse to page [miranda_bailey] and [dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd.
When the drugs still do not work, [meredith_grey] prepares the paddles.
On the fourth attempt, [katie_bryce]'s heartbeat and blood flow return to normal.
[dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd arrives and tells [meredith_grey] to leave.
[miranda_bailey] walks by and lectures [meredith_grey], but [meredith_grey] ignores her and quickly exits the hospital.
[cristina_yang] is worried as she sees [meredith_grey] vomit against a tree.
[meredith_grey] goes back into the hospital and asks [cristina_yang] not to tell anyone.
In the hospital, [dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd tells [katie_bryce]'s parents that [katie_bryce]'s condition might not be a seizure disorder.
[katie_bryce]'s parents express their desire for a different doctor because they feel [dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd isn't trying hard enough.
Meanwhile, [preston_burke] explains a procedure to a patient.
[preston_burke] tells the patient he will put the patient on bypass, fix the patient's heart, and then finish.
Gloria, [tony_savitch]'s wife, asks if she should be worried.
[preston_burke] reassures Gloria that he is skilled, but surgery does have risks.
After [preston_burke] leaves, Gloria remains anxious.
[george_omalley] comforts Gloria and promises that [tony_savitch] will do well in surgery.
While waiting for [dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd, [cristina_yang] sutures a banana.
[cristina_yang] jokingly calls [george_omalley] 007 when [george_omalley] laughs, but quickly apologizes, saying she becomes mean when tired.
[dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd enters and explains that [katie_bryce] is having seizures without a clear cause.
[dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd mentions that the intern who discovers the cause will assist in the advanced surgery.
The interns take copies of [katie_bryce]'s chart.
[alex_karev] approaches a nurse and asks if the nurse paged him.
The nurse confirms she did and mentions that the patient in room 4B is not responding to antibiotics.
[alex_karev] dismisses the nurse's concern, stating the patient is old, and asks the nurse not to page him again.
[meredith_grey] walks away, and [cristina_yang] runs after [meredith_grey].
[cristina_yang] suggests they work together to increase their chances of getting into the surgery.
[meredith_grey] agrees but says [meredith_grey] wants to avoid spending time with [dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd. In the hospital library, [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] discuss [katie_bryce]'s condition. [cristina_yang] asks why [meredith_grey] wants to avoid [dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd. [meredith_grey] eventually reveals that [meredith_grey] and [dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd had sex. They return to discussing [katie_bryce], and [meredith_grey] suddenly realizes something. [meredith_grey] tells [cristina_yang] to get up, and they go to find [dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd. They confront [dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd and tell him that [katie_bryce] might have an aneurysm, even though [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] lack proof. [katie_bryce] had a minor fall, which [katie_bryce]'s doctor did not mention. [dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd goes to investigate and is shocked to find that [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] were correct; [katie_bryce] is bleeding in her brain. [dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd explains that [katie_bryce] could have lived her whole life without this being a problem and congratulates [cristina_yang] and [meredith_grey]. He then chooses [meredith_grey] to assist him in the operating room. After [dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd leaves, [cristina_yang] glares at [meredith_grey] and storms off. Meanwhile, [preston_burke] is performing surgery on [tony_savitch]. After some time, [preston_burke] finishes and goes outside to [george_omalley]. [george_omalley] is surprised by how quickly [preston_burke] worked. [preston_burke] explains that the heart was too damaged and [tony_savitch] died. [george_omalley] is shocked and upset. [george_omalley] tells [preston_burke] that [george_omalley] had promised Gloria that [tony_savitch] would be okay.
[preston_burke] is very angry.
[preston_burke] says only God can keep a promise like that.
[preston_burke] tells [george_omalley] he can inform Gloria.
[izzie_stevens] and [cristina_yang] are alone.
[izzie_stevens] tries to convince [cristina_yang] that [meredith_grey] might not be to blame.
[cristina_yang] interrupts [izzie_stevens].
[meredith_grey] arrives and wants to apologize.
[cristina_yang] tells [meredith_grey] she can't seek forgiveness from her.
[cristina_yang] points out that [meredith_grey] didn't get into medical school because of [meredith_grey]'s mother or good surgeries from sleeping with [dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd.
[meredith_grey] then leaves in anger.
[george_omalley] is in the waiting area.
[george_omalley] tries to tell Gloria that [tony_savitch] has died.
[george_omalley] wants to apologize, but Gloria asks him to go and then sits down heavily in a chair.
[dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd is shaving [katie_bryce]'s head.
[meredith_grey] says she doesn't want to assist in the procedure, but [dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd insists she must.
[dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd explains that his decision is not because they had sex, but because [meredith_grey] is [katie_bryce]'s doctor and saved [katie_bryce]'s life on [meredith_grey]'s first day.
[meredith_grey] and [george_omalley] sit on a window ledge outside.
[meredith_grey] and [george_omalley] both wish they had chosen different careers.
[george_omalley] mentions that [george_omalley]'s parents brag about [george_omalley] being a surgeon as if it’s a major achievement. [meredith_grey] shares that when [meredith_grey] told [meredith_grey]'s mother about wanting to go to medical school, [meredith_grey]'s mother tried to dissuade [meredith_grey], doubting [meredith_grey]'s abilities. [meredith_grey] tells [george_omalley] he shouldn't feel too bad. The chief asks [alex_karev] some questions. When [alex_karev] does not respond, the chief asks the room if anyone knows the common causes of post-operative fever. No one answers, but [meredith_grey] does. The chief then asks [meredith_grey] what she thinks is wrong with the patient. [meredith_grey] correctly identifies patient 4B as likely having a pulmonary embolism. The chief asks [meredith_grey] how [meredith_grey] would diagnose it, and [meredith_grey] answers correctly again. The chief tells [alex_karev] to follow [meredith_grey]'s advice and then leaves the case. As the chief walks away, the chief tells [meredith_grey] he would recognize [meredith_grey] anywhere and that [meredith_grey] looks just like [meredith_grey]'s mother. [meredith_grey] then walks to the operating room where [katie_bryce] is being prepared. [meredith_grey] watches with admiration. When [dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd tells [meredith_grey] to take a look, [meredith_grey] does and is amazed. [meredith_grey] realizes that this is more than just a game; they are responsible for people's lives. After the surgery, [cristina_yang] praises [meredith_grey]. A few minutes later, [cristina_yang] and [meredith_grey] reconcile. Soon after [cristina_yang] leaves, [dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd arrives.
[meredith_grey] tells [dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd the surgery exceeded [meredith_grey]'s expectations.
[meredith_grey] and [dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd share a brief moment before [dr_derek_shepherd] Shepherd says he will see [meredith_grey] later.
Later, [meredith_grey] leaves the hospital with [cristina_yang], [izzie_stevens], and [george_omalley].
Eventually, [meredith_grey] walks up the steps of a house in the rain.
[meredith_grey] informs [ellis_grey] that [meredith_grey] will not sell [ellis_grey]'s house anymore and plans to get roommates.
[meredith_grey] mentions that [meredith_grey]'s fellow interns are great.
[ellis_grey] asks if [meredith_grey] is [ellis_grey]'s doctor, but [meredith_grey] clarifies that [meredith_grey] is not, although [meredith_grey] is a doctor.
[ellis_grey] then asks for [meredith_grey]'s name, and [meredith_grey] reminds [ellis_grey].
[ellis_grey] believes she used to be a doctor, and [meredith_grey] smiles, confirming that [ellis_grey] was indeed a doctor.
[ellis_grey] has Alzheimer's disease.
