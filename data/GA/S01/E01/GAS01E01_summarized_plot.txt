Meredith Grey wakes up on her couch, feeling embarrassed after a night with Dr. Derek Shepherd. As she prepares for her first day at Seattle Grace Hospital, she interacts with Derek, who compliments her home, which she clarifies is her mother's and is for sale. At the hospital, Meredith meets fellow interns Cristina Yang, George O'Malley, and Izzie Stevens, and they learn they have a strict resident, Miranda Bailey. They are introduced to a patient, Katie Bryce, who is having seizures. The interns are assigned various tasks, with Meredith tasked to perform a CT scan on Katie.

During their shifts, the interns face challenges, including George's struggle during a procedure that leads to him being nicknamed "007." Meredith later discovers Katie faked a seizure and becomes frustrated. Meanwhile, Izzie seeks help from Miranda for a central line, and Alex Karev dismisses Meredith's medical input. Meredith eventually realizes Katie might have an aneurysm, prompting her and Cristina to inform Dr. Derek, who confirms their suspicion and allows Meredith to assist in surgery.

As the day progresses, George grapples with the death of a patient, and tensions rise among the interns, particularly between Meredith and Cristina. Meredith tries to apologize but is rebuffed. After a successful surgery on Katie, Meredith gains respect from her peers, and she reconciles with Cristina. Later, Meredith decides not to sell her mother's house and plans to get roommates, revealing her mother's Alzheimer's diagnosis.
