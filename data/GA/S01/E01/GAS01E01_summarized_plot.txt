Meredith Grey wakes up on the couch and prepares for her first day at a new job at Seattle Grace Hospital. After a brief encounter with Derek Shepherd, whom she had a one-night stand with, she heads to the hospital where she meets fellow interns Cristina Yang, George O'Malley, and Isobel Stevens. They are introduced to their resident, Miranda Bailey, who is nicknamed "The Nazi." The interns are quickly thrown into the chaos of hospital life, dealing with a patient named Katie Bryce who is having seizures.

As the day progresses, Meredith is assigned to Katie Bryce, while George struggles in the operating room under the supervision of Preston Burke. Meredith and Cristina suspect Katie Bryce has an aneurysm, leading to a breakthrough in her diagnosis. Derek chooses Meredith to assist in the surgery, which she initially resists due to her feelings about their previous encounter.

Meanwhile, George grapples with the emotional weight of a patient's death, and tensions rise between Meredith and Cristina, who feels betrayed by Meredith's connection to Derek. After a successful surgery on Katie Bryce, Meredith realizes the gravity of their work as doctors. The episode concludes with Meredith deciding to keep her mother's house and acknowledging her identity as a doctor, while revealing that her mother, Ellis Grey, suffers from Alzheimer's disease.
