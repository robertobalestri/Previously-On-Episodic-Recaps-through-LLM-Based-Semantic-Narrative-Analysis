A woman named Meredith wakes up on her couch, embarrassed after a night with a man named Derek. She is late for her first day at Seattle Grace Hospital, where she meets other new interns, including Cristina Yang, George O'Malley, and Isobel "Izzie" Stevens. They learn they have Miranda Bailey as their resident, who they initially think is intimidating.

During their first shift, the interns are assigned to a patient, Katie Bryce, who is having seizures. Meredith is tasked with getting a CT for Katie, while the others handle various procedures. George struggles in the operating room, leading to a mishap that earns him the nickname "007." Meanwhile, Meredith has a tense encounter with Derek, who is revealed to be her one-night stand.

As the day progresses, Meredith faces challenges with Katie's care, including a critical moment where she revives Katie after a severe seizure. However, she later learns that Katie's condition may be more serious than initially thought. The interns bond over their struggles, but tensions rise, particularly between Meredith and Cristina, who feels Meredith's connections give her an unfair advantage.

Derek discovers that Katie has a brain aneurysm, and he invites Meredith to assist in her surgery, recognizing her contributions. Meanwhile, George grapples with the death of a patient he had promised would be okay, leading to a confrontation with Burke, who emphasizes the harsh realities of medicine.

Meredith and Cristina eventually reconcile after a heated exchange, and Meredith gains confidence in her abilities as a doctor. The episode concludes with Meredith deciding to keep her mother's house and embrace her new life as a doctor, revealing that her mother, Ellis Grey, is suffering from Alzheimer's.
