1
00:00:03,502 --> 00:00:04,500
The game --

2
00:00:05,493 --> 00:00:09,234
they say a person either has what it takes to play or they don't.

3
00:00:09,852 --> 00:00:12,711
My mother was one of the greats.

4
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:14,960
Me, on the other hand --

5
00:00:15,297 --> 00:00:17,155
I'm kind of screwed.

6
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:39,102
This is, uh...

7
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:41,425
Humiliating on so many levels.

8
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:42,419
You have to go.

9
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,546
Why don't you just come back down here, and we'll pick up where we left off?

10
00:00:45,598 --> 00:00:47,759
No, seriously. You have to go. I'm late,

11
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,537
which isn't what you want to be on your first day of work, so...

12
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:53,205
So, uh, you actually live here.

13
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:54,166
No.

14
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:57,087
Yes, kind of.

15
00:01:00,312 --> 00:01:02,341
It's nice -- a little dusty --

16
00:01:02,556 --> 00:01:04,004
odd, but it's nice.

17
00:01:05,402 --> 00:01:06,703
So, how do you kind of live here?

18
00:01:07,184 --> 00:01:10,809
I moved two weeks ago from boston. It was my mother's house. I'm selling it.

19
00:01:10,876 --> 00:01:11,797
Oh, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:12,545 --> 00:01:13,302
For what?

21
00:01:13,696 --> 00:01:14,804
You said "was."

22
00:01:14,946 --> 00:01:17,505
Oh, my mother's not dead. She's --

23
00:01:17,588 --> 00:01:19,473
You know what? We don't have to do the thing.

24
00:01:19,564 --> 00:01:21,751
Oh, we can do anything you want.

25
00:01:21,935 --> 00:01:25,054
No, the thing -- exchange the details, pretend we care.

26
00:01:25,135 --> 00:01:27,393
I'm gonna go upstairs and take a shower, okay?

27
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,185
And when I get back down here, you won't be here, so, um...

28
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:34,831
goodbye, um...

29
00:01:37,367 --> 00:01:38,273
Derek.

30
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,444
Derek. Right. Meredith.

31
00:01:40,525 --> 00:01:41,141
Meredith.

32
00:01:41,212 --> 00:01:43,076
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

33
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:45,149
- Nice meeting you.
- Bye, Derek.

34
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,837
Each of you comes here today hopeful,

35
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:09,475
wanting in on the game.

36
00:02:09,884 --> 00:02:13,119
A month ago, you were in med school, being taught by doctors.

37
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:15,343
Today...

38
00:02:16,264 --> 00:02:17,949
you are the doctors.

39
00:02:20,395 --> 00:02:24,799
The 7 years you spend here as a surgical resident will be the best and worst of your life.

40
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,852
You will be pushed to the breaking point.

41
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:28,567
Look around you.

42
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,513
Say hello to your competition.

43
00:02:31,387 --> 00:02:34,060
Eight of you will switch to an easier specialty.

44
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:36,002
Five of you will crack under the pressure.

45
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:37,723
Two of you will be asked to leave.

46
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,836
This is your starting line.

47
00:02:40,112 --> 00:02:41,659
This is your arena.

48
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:43,645
How well you play...

49
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:46,774
that's up to you.

50
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:49,252
Like I said...

51
00:02:50,552 --> 00:02:51,714
I'm screwed.

52
00:03:02,303 --> 00:03:05,937
Okay, Martin, Robinson, Bond, Hawkins.

53
00:03:10,321 --> 00:03:11,990
Only 6 women out of 20.

54
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:14,315
Yeah. I hear one of them's a model.

55
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:17,371
Seriously, that's gonna help with the respect thing?

56
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:20,546
- You're Cristina, right?
- Patton, Monroe...

57
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:23,986
Which resident are you assigned to? I got bailey.

58
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,701
The nazi? Me too.

59
00:03:25,778 --> 00:03:27,668
You got the nazi? So did I.

60
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,573
At least we'll be tortured together, right?

61
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:32,348
I'm George O'malley.

62
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:39,832
Uh, we met at the mixer. You had on a black dress with a slit up the side, strappy sandals...

63
00:03:41,714 --> 00:03:44,216
Now you think I'm gay. No, I'm not gay.

64
00:03:44,304 --> 00:03:49,576
It's -- it's just that you were -- you were very unforgettable.

65
00:03:49,735 --> 00:03:52,634
O'malley, Yang, Grey, Stevens.

66
00:03:53,425 --> 00:03:55,024
And I'm totally forgettable.

67
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,738
- Bailey?
- End of the hall.

68
00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:00,697
That's the nazi?

69
00:04:01,384 --> 00:04:02,873
I thought the nazi would be a guy.

70
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:06,156
I thought the nazi would be a nazi.

71
00:04:06,274 --> 00:04:07,927
Maybe it's professional jealousy.

72
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:11,071
Maybe she's brilliant, and they call her a nazi because they're jealous.

73
00:04:11,272 --> 00:04:12,213
Maybe she's nice.

74
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:13,764
Let me guess -- you're the model.

75
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:17,845
Hi, I'm Isobel Stevens, but everyone calls me "Izzie."

76
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:21,894
I have five rules. Memorize them.

77
00:04:21,956 --> 00:04:25,720
Rule number one -- don't bother sucking up. I already hate you. That's not gonna change.

78
00:04:25,802 --> 00:04:30,175
Trauma protocol, phone list, pagers -- nurses will page you.

79
00:04:30,276 --> 00:04:34,602
You will answer every page at a run -- a run -- that's rule number two.

80
00:04:34,736 --> 00:04:38,350
Your first shift starts now and lasts 48 hours.

81
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:42,754
You're interns, grunts, nobodies, bottom of the surgical food chain.

82
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:47,023
You run labs, write orders, work every second night until you drop, and don't complain.

83
00:04:47,106 --> 00:04:49,974
On-call rooms -- attendings hog them.

84
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:52,701
Sleep when you can where you can, which brings me to rule number three.

85
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:56,844
If I'm sleeping, don't wake me unless your patient is actually dying.

86
00:04:56,911 --> 00:04:59,641
Rule number four -- the dying patient better not be dead when I get there.

87
00:04:59,702 --> 00:05:03,582
Not only will you have killed someone, you would have woke me for no good reason. We clear?

88
00:05:03,932 --> 00:05:04,847
Yes?

89
00:05:04,944 --> 00:05:07,566
You said five rules. That was only four.

90
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,196
Rule number five -- when I move, you move.

91
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:13,985
Get out of my way!

92
00:05:29,232 --> 00:05:30,012
What do we got?

93
00:05:30,094 --> 00:05:34,953
Katie Bryce, 15-year-old female, new onset seizures, intermittent for the past week.

94
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:38,701
I.V. lost en route, started grand mal seizing as we descended.

95
00:05:38,828 --> 00:05:40,201
All right, get her on her side.

96
00:05:40,913 --> 00:05:43,376
Izzie, 10 milligrams diazepam I.M.

97
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,356
No, no. The white lead is on the right.

98
00:05:46,423 --> 00:05:48,495
Righty, whity -- smoke over fire.

99
00:05:48,618 --> 00:05:51,670
A large-bore I.V. Don't let the blood hemolyze. Let's go!

100
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,027
What do we have? A wet fish on dry land.

101
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:00,722
Absolutely, Dr. Burke.

102
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:04,265
Dr. Bailey, let's shotgun her.

103
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:08,443
That  means every test in the book -- C.T., CBC, chem-7, tox screen.

104
00:06:08,505 --> 00:06:11,557
Cristina, you're on labs. George, patient work-ups.

105
00:06:11,658 --> 00:06:13,619
Meredith,  get katie for a C.T.

106
00:06:13,712 --> 00:06:15,780
She's your responsibility now.

107
00:06:15,955 --> 00:06:17,285
Wait.  What about me?

108
00:06:18,908 --> 00:06:21,167
Honey, you get to do rectal exams.

109
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:38,201
What are you doing here?

110
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:42,983
Katie Bryce's labs came out clear. There's nothing in the results that explain her seizures.

111
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,761
- I just thought you wanna know.
- Okay.

112
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:48,999
I heard every year, the attending on call picks the best intern

113
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,856
and lets them perform a procedure during the first shift.

114
00:06:54,739 --> 00:06:56,654
I'm just saying it's what I heard.

115
00:06:56,729 --> 00:06:58,881
Go away... now.

116
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:01,503
Yeah, sounds good.

117
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:02,414
He'll be fine?

118
00:07:02,516 --> 00:07:03,329
You'll be fine.

119
00:07:03,454 --> 00:07:06,447
If you don't count the fact that my bacon days are over, sure.

120
00:07:06,546 --> 00:07:09,494
So, bypass surgery tomorrow with Dr. Burke -- I hear he's good.

121
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:13,431
And, after that, you can have all the bacon-flavored soy product you can eat.

122
00:07:13,503 --> 00:07:14,963
Mmm. Kill me now.

123
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:17,906
I wish I could, but I'm a healer.

124
00:07:20,995 --> 00:07:21,998
You're lost.

125
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:24,574
I'm not lost.

126
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:25,720
How are you feeling?

127
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,363
How do you think I'm feeling?

128
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:28,858
I'm missing my pageant.

129
00:07:28,935 --> 00:07:30,180
You're missing your pageant?

130
00:07:30,252 --> 00:07:31,858
The spokane teen miss.

131
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,572
I was in the top 10 after the first 2 rounds.

132
00:07:34,665 --> 00:07:35,883
This is my year.

133
00:07:35,985 --> 00:07:37,086
I could have won.

134
00:07:37,706 --> 00:07:38,561
Hello.

135
00:07:39,462 --> 00:07:41,909
You're so lost. What are you, like, new?

136
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:48,750
Okay, so I'm just gonna insert my fingers into your rectum.

137
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:56,609
No.

138
00:07:59,685 --> 00:08:00,403
Out.

139
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:01,924
Out.

140
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:06,122
Bet you missed a lot when you first started out.

141
00:08:09,604 --> 00:08:11,518
I twisted my ankle in talent rehearsal.

142
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:14,607
I do rhythmic gymnastics, which is, like, really cool.

143
00:08:14,698 --> 00:08:15,799
Nobody else does it.

144
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:20,417
And I tripped over my ribbon. And I didn't get stuck with someone this clueless,

145
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:23,125
and that was, like, a nurse.

146
00:08:23,216 --> 00:08:25,696
You and I are gonna have so much fun together.

147
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,849
This shift is a marathon, not a sprint. Eat.

148
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,745
I can't.

149
00:08:36,826 --> 00:08:37,851
You should eat something.

150
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:42,097
You try eating after performing 17 rectal exams. The nazi hates me.

151
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:45,116
The nazi's a resident. I have attendings hating me.

152
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:46,617
You know Meredith is inbred?

153
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:49,192
Like it's uncommon around here to be a doctors' parents --

154
00:08:49,254 --> 00:08:51,405
No, royally inbred -- her mother is Ellis Grey.

155
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:52,606
Shut up. The Ellis Grey?

156
00:08:52,893 --> 00:08:53,703
Who's Ellis Grey?

157
00:08:54,705 --> 00:08:57,206
The Grey Method. Where'd you go to med school -- Mexico?

158
00:08:57,297 --> 00:08:59,907
She was one of the first big chick surgeons.

159
00:09:00,054 --> 00:09:02,878
She's a living legend. Yeah, she won the harper avery twice.

160
00:09:02,955 --> 00:09:04,419
So I didn't know one thing.

161
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:05,878
Talk about parental pressure.

162
00:09:05,947 --> 00:09:08,030
God, I would kill to have Ellis Grey as a mother.

163
00:09:08,151 --> 00:09:09,882
I'd kill to be Ellis Grey.

164
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:11,490
All I need is one good case.

165
00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:15,428
Katie Bryce is a pain in the ass.

166
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:19,246
If I hadn't taken the hippocratic oath, I'd kevorkian her with my bare hands.

167
00:09:20,808 --> 00:09:21,725
What?

168
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,372
Good afternoon, interns.

169
00:09:25,902 --> 00:09:29,456
It's posted, but I thought I'd share the good news personally.

170
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:32,800
As you know, the honor of performing the first surgery

171
00:09:32,843 --> 00:09:36,225
is reserved for the intern that shows the most promise.

172
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:39,830
As I'm running the O.R. today, I get to make that choice.

173
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:43,183
George O'malley.

174
00:09:43,265 --> 00:09:43,977
Me?

175
00:09:44,156 --> 00:09:46,332
You'll scrub in for an appendectomy this afternoon.

176
00:09:46,425 --> 00:09:47,480
Congratulations.

177
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:48,585
Enjoy it.

178
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:56,439
Did he say me?

179
00:09:56,917 --> 00:10:00,734
I've seen his file. George O'malley barely made the cut to get in this program.

180
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:01,979
He's not your guy.

181
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:03,116
He's my guy, all right.

182
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:07,263
Every year, you pick your guy, and every year, your guy suffers more than any other intern.

183
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:09,403
Terrorize one, and the rest fall in line.

184
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,448
I get it, I respect it, but George O'malley's a puppy.

185
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,317
- Katie Bryce -- 3604?
- It's right there.

186
00:10:15,384 --> 00:10:16,191
Thank you.

187
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,818
Katie, honey, mom and dad are here.

188
00:10:18,906 --> 00:10:22,291
They gave her a sedative for the C.T. scan, so she's a little groggy.

189
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:23,646
Will she be all right?

190
00:10:23,796 --> 00:10:27,959
Our doctor at home said that she might need an operation. Is that true?

191
00:10:28,024 --> 00:10:29,166
What kind of operation?

192
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:31,634
She's, um -- well...

193
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,537
You know what? I'm not the doctor.

194
00:10:34,722 --> 00:10:39,821
I'm a doctor, but I'm not Katie's doctor, so I'll go get him for you.

195
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,532
What?

196
00:10:44,608 --> 00:10:47,876
Katie's parents have questions. Do you talk to them, or do I ask Burke?

197
00:10:48,003 --> 00:10:52,575
No, Burke's off the case. Katie belongs to the new attending now, Dr. Shepherd. He's over there.

198
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,185
Dr. Shepherd.

199
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:13,568
Dr. Shepherd?

200
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:15,734
This morning, it was Derek.

201
00:11:16,137 --> 00:11:17,689
Now it's Dr. Shepherd.

202
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:19,922
Dr. Shepherd, we should pretend it never happened.

203
00:11:19,998 --> 00:11:23,884
What never happened -- you sleeping with me last night, or you throwing me out this morning?

204
00:11:23,956 --> 00:11:26,163
Because both are fond memories I'd like to hold onto.

205
00:11:26,255 --> 00:11:28,646
No, there will be no memories.

206
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,523
I'm not the girl in the bar anymore, and you're not the guy.

207
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:32,981
This can't exist.

208
00:11:33,096 --> 00:11:34,452
You get that, right?

209
00:11:34,723 --> 00:11:36,659
You took advantage of me, and now you want to forget about it.

210
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,567
I was drunk, vulnerable, and good-looking, and you took advantage.

211
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:42,886
Okay, I was the one who was drunk, and you are not that good-looking.

212
00:11:42,957 --> 00:11:44,079
Maybe not today.

213
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:47,873
Last night, I was very good-looking. I had my red shirt on. You took advantage.

214
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:51,277
- I did not take advantage.
- Want to take advantage again -- say, friday night?

215
00:11:53,115 --> 00:11:53,996
No.

216
00:11:55,204 --> 00:11:57,774
You're an attending, and I'm your intern.

217
00:11:58,471 --> 00:12:00,350
Stop looking at me like that.

218
00:12:00,527 --> 00:12:01,210
Like what?

219
00:12:01,277 --> 00:12:02,705
Like you've seen me naked.

220
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:07,778
Dr. Shepherd, this is inappropriate.

221
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:09,899
Has that ever occurred to you?

222
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:17,907
Open, identify, ligate, remove, irrigate, close.

223
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,932
Open, identify, ligate, remove, irrigate, close.

224
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:22,391
He's gonna faint. He's a fainter.

225
00:12:22,489 --> 00:12:24,430
No, code brown, right in his pants.

226
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:27,052
He's all about the flop sweat. He's gonna sweat himself unsterile.

227
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,771
10 bucks says he messes up the mcburney.

228
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:29,611
$15 says he cries.

229
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:31,080
I'll put $20 on a total meltdown.

230
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,502
$50 says he pulls the whole thing off.

231
00:12:35,442 --> 00:12:39,314
That's one of us down there, the first one of us.

232
00:12:39,386 --> 00:12:40,795
Where's your loyalty?

233
00:12:43,231 --> 00:12:46,343
- $75 says he can't even I.D. the appendix.
- I'll take that action.

234
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:49,103
Okay,  O'malley, let's see what you can do.

235
00:12:50,142 --> 00:12:51,403
Here it comes.

236
00:12:55,356 --> 00:12:56,042
Scalpel.

237
00:12:56,415 --> 00:12:57,045
Scalpel.

238
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:03,665
That burke is trouble.

239
00:13:08,827 --> 00:13:09,762
More pressure.

240
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:12,467
The human flesh is a tough shell. Dig in.

241
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:17,069
Pickups.

242
00:13:17,642 --> 00:13:18,303
Pickups.

243
00:13:21,436 --> 00:13:22,117
Clamp.

244
00:13:22,783 --> 00:13:23,433
Clamp.

245
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,007
I'm there.

246
00:13:34,094 --> 00:13:36,080
Damn, he got the peritoneum open. I'm out.

247
00:13:36,178 --> 00:13:37,954
I told you -- he's gonna pull it off.

248
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:47,759
Scalpel.

249
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:48,788
Scalpel.

250
00:13:52,418 --> 00:13:53,553
Appendix is out.

251
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,247
Not bad.

252
00:13:56,805 --> 00:13:57,529
Thank you.

253
00:13:57,886 --> 00:14:02,315
Now all you have to do is invert the stump into the cecum

254
00:14:02,803 --> 00:14:06,615
and simultaneously pull up on the purse strings,

255
00:14:06,774 --> 00:14:08,453
but be careful not to...

256
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,635
break them.

257
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:13,819
You ripped the cecum.

258
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:14,925
You've got a bleeder.

259
00:14:15,007 --> 00:14:16,927
You're filling with stool. What do you do now?

260
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:17,808
Uh...

261
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:24,566
Think. You start the suction, and you start digging for those purse strings before she bleeds to death.

262
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,087
Give him a clamp.

263
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:27,229
B.P.'s dropping.

264
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:28,586
He's choking.

265
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:29,825
Come on, George.

266
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:33,077
Today. Pull your balalls out of your back pocket. Let's go.

267
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:35,022
What are you waiting for? Suction.

268
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:38,313
Getting too low, folks.

269
00:14:39,998 --> 00:14:41,058
Dr. Burke.

270
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:42,328
Get out of the way.

271
00:14:43,025 --> 00:14:44,335
Pansy-ass idiot.

272
00:14:44,428 --> 00:14:45,374
Get him out of here.

273
00:14:45,743 --> 00:14:47,566
Suction. Clamp.

274
00:14:50,335 --> 00:14:52,721
- He's 007.
- 007, yep.

275
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,252
- A total 007.
- What's "007" mean?

276
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,531
License to kill.

277
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:09,839
007. They're calling me "007," aren't they?

278
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,784
- No one's calling you 007.
- No one's calling you 007.

279
00:15:11,849 --> 00:15:14,108
On the elevator, murphy whispered, "007."

280
00:15:14,184 --> 00:15:16,688
How many times do we have to go through this, George? 5, 10?

281
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:18,143
Give me a number, or else I'm gonna hit you.

282
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:20,328
Murphy whispered, "007," and everyone laughed.

283
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,726
He wasn't talking about you.

284
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:22,684
Are you sure?

285
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:23,887
Would we lie to you?

286
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,055
Yes.

287
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:26,878
007 is a state of mind.

288
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:29,843
Says the girl who finished first in her class at stanford.

289
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:36,595
Oh, man. It's 911 for Katie Bryce.

290
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,165
I got to go.

291
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,018
Maybe I should have gone into geriatrics.

292
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:50,568
No one minds when you kill an old person.

293
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:55,750
Surgery is hot. It's the marines. It's macho. It's hostile. It's hard-core.

294
00:15:56,144 --> 00:16:00,040
Geriatrics is for freaks who live with their mothers and never have sex.

295
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,679
I've  got to get my own place.

296
00:16:11,617 --> 00:16:12,917
Excuse me! Excuse me!

297
00:16:15,968 --> 00:16:17,407
Took you long enough.

298
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,364
You're okay? The nurse paged me "911."

299
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:22,552
I had to go all "exorcist" to get her to even pick up the phone.

300
00:16:24,731 --> 00:16:25,660
Wait.

301
00:16:25,896 --> 00:16:27,178
There's nothing wrong with you?

302
00:16:27,248 --> 00:16:28,103
I'm bored.

303
00:16:30,187 --> 00:16:31,283
You little...

304
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:34,826
- I'm not a cruise director.
- You don't have to wig out.

305
00:16:35,155 --> 00:16:38,978
The pageant's supposed to be on cable, but this crappy hospital doesn't get the channel.

306
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,834
If that cow kylie wood is gonna walk off with my crown, I have to see it.

307
00:16:43,187 --> 00:16:44,237
Can you call someone?

308
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:49,531
Okay, this is an actual hospital.

309
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:51,380
There are sick people here.

310
00:16:51,554 --> 00:16:54,189
Go to sleep, and stop wasting my time.

311
00:16:54,282 --> 00:16:56,832
But I can't sleep. My head's all full.

312
00:16:56,931 --> 00:16:58,270
That's called "thinking."

313
00:16:58,368 --> 00:16:59,309
Go with it.

314
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,769
What do you need?

315
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,855
Mr. Jones has junky veins, and he really needs antibiotics.

316
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:19,569
I should start a central line.

317
00:17:19,676 --> 00:17:20,692
So start one.

318
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:22,908
You don't know how.

319
00:17:23,435 --> 00:17:24,510
I've never done one.

320
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,608
Well, you know what that means.

321
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:31,407
Can't we just page someone else?

322
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:32,831
She's the on-call resident.

323
00:17:34,244 --> 00:17:35,073
Okay.

324
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:37,578
Okay, I'll just -- I'll wake her.

325
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:47,305
- Dr. Bailey, I don't mean to bother you.
- Then don't.

326
00:17:47,392 --> 00:17:49,692
- It's mr. Jones.
- Is he dying?

327
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:50,491
No.

328
00:17:50,592 --> 00:17:52,364
Then stop talking to me.

329
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,595
What is it?!

330
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:13,197
Next time you wake me, he better be so close to dead, there's a tag on his toe.

331
00:18:22,413 --> 00:18:24,241
Here. Take these to the lab.

332
00:18:29,905 --> 00:18:32,065
4-b's got post-op pneumonia.

333
00:18:32,142 --> 00:18:33,135
Let's start antibiotics.

334
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,599
Are you sure that's the right diagnosis?

335
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,441
Well, I don't know. I'm only an intern.

336
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:42,193
Why don't you go spend 4 years in med school and then let me know if it's the right diagnosis?

337
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,438
She's short of breath. She's got fever. She's post-op.

338
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:46,882
Start the antibiotics.

339
00:18:48,632 --> 00:18:49,950
God, I hate nurses.

340
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,025
I'm Alex.

341
00:18:54,654 --> 00:18:57,076
I'm with Jeremy. You're with the nazi, right?

342
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,820
She may not have pneumonia, you know? She could be splinting, or have a P.E.

343
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:02,775
Like I said, I hate nurses.

344
00:19:03,948 --> 00:19:05,093
What did you just say?

345
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:08,268
Did you just call me a nurse?

346
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,922
Well, if the white cap fits.

347
00:19:13,344 --> 00:19:14,572
Damn it, Katie.

348
00:19:16,107 --> 00:19:17,397
Is she seeing anybody?

349
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:18,488
I don't know.

350
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:19,804
She's hot.

351
00:19:20,014 --> 00:19:21,017
I'm friends with her.

352
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:25,053
I mean kind of friends -- not actually friends, exactly,

353
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:29,005
but we're tight, and we hang out -- really, only just today.

354
00:19:29,082 --> 00:19:31,166
- Dude.
- Dude, stop talking.

355
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:46,888
What took you so long?

356
00:19:47,796 --> 00:19:50,383
She's having multiple grand mal seizures.

357
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,609
Now, how do you want to proceed?

358
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:55,148
Dr. Grey, are you listening to me?!

359
00:19:56,044 --> 00:20:00,186
She's got diazepam -- 2 milligrams lorazepam -- I just gave the second dose.

360
00:20:00,355 --> 00:20:03,090
Dr. Grey, you need to tell us what you want to do.

361
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:04,984
Dr. Grey!

362
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,504
- Okay, she's full on lorazepam?
- She's had 4 milligrams.

363
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,464
You paged Dr. Bailey and Dr. Shepherd?

364
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:13,698
Lorazepam's not working.

365
00:20:13,923 --> 00:20:15,946
Phenobarbital -- load her with phenobarbital.

366
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,285
Pheno's  in.

367
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:20,335
No change.

368
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:22,474
- You paged Dr. Shepherd?
- I just told you.

369
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:25,444
Well, page him again, stat.

370
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:26,448
What do you want to do?

371
00:20:26,882 --> 00:20:29,279
Dr. Grey, you need to tell us what you want to do.

372
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,699
- Heart stopped.
- Code blue! Code blue!

373
00:20:34,138 --> 00:20:35,531
Code blue! Code blue!

374
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:42,064
Wait.

375
00:20:43,568 --> 00:20:45,054
Charge the pads to 200.

376
00:20:45,123 --> 00:20:45,858
Charge.

377
00:20:46,072 --> 00:20:46,836
Clear.

378
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:50,912
Still v-fib. Nothing.

379
00:20:51,005 --> 00:20:51,628
Charging.

380
00:20:51,812 --> 00:20:52,667
19 seconds.

381
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,788
Charge them to 300.

382
00:20:54,323 --> 00:20:56,031
300. Anything?

383
00:20:56,108 --> 00:20:56,988
27 seconds.

384
00:20:57,408 --> 00:20:58,570
Charge to 360.

385
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,084
Come on, Katie.

386
00:21:01,187 --> 00:21:02,231
49 seconds.

387
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,448
At 60 seconds, you're supposed to admin her another drug.

388
00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:05,120
Charge again!

389
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,858
Charge again.

390
00:21:13,264 --> 00:21:13,889
Anything?

391
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:15,212
I see sinus rhythm.

392
00:21:16,002 --> 00:21:17,197
Blood pressure's coming up.

393
00:21:17,348 --> 00:21:18,098
All right.

394
00:21:19,251 --> 00:21:20,135
Pressure's returning.

395
00:21:20,387 --> 00:21:21,334
Rate's coming back.

396
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,071
What the hell happened?

397
00:21:23,387 --> 00:21:25,282
She had a seizure, and her heart stopped.

398
00:21:25,394 --> 00:21:26,807
You were supposed to be monitoring her.

399
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:29,428
- I checked on her --
- I got her. Just -- just go.

400
00:21:33,152 --> 00:21:34,130
Somebody give me her --

401
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:36,310
give me her chart, please.

402
00:21:36,607 --> 00:21:39,107
You get a 911, you page me immediately,

403
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:42,019
not in the 5 minutes it takes you to get to the emergency, immediately.

404
00:21:42,096 --> 00:21:45,497
You're on my team, and if somebody dies, it's my ass.

405
00:21:47,713 --> 00:21:48,506
Meredith?

406
00:22:11,362 --> 00:22:12,924
You tell anyone, ever...

407
00:22:24,123 --> 00:22:26,625
You said it was a seizure disorder.

408
00:22:26,753 --> 00:22:27,782
Now you're saying it isn't?

409
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,328
I'm saying that I don't know.

410
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:30,655
What do you think it could be?

411
00:22:30,794 --> 00:22:31,545
I don't know.

412
00:22:31,638 --> 00:22:32,548
When will you know?

413
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,951
I don't have an answer for you.

414
00:22:34,024 --> 00:22:38,180
- For now, Katie is stable, and -- 
- Wait one damn minute.

415
00:22:38,314 --> 00:22:42,703
We came here because this hospital is supposed to be the best in washington.

416
00:22:43,392 --> 00:22:46,239
That's my kid in there -- my kid --

417
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:49,112
and you have the audacity to stand here and tell me, "I don't know."

418
00:22:49,183 --> 00:22:49,762
Mr. Bryce -- 

419
00:22:49,843 --> 00:22:53,362
No, I want someone else, a doctor who knows what they're doing.

420
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:55,901
You get me someone else, someone better than you.

421
00:22:55,968 --> 00:22:58,042
Mr. Bryce, I assure you that I am working hard on Katie's case.

422
00:22:58,092 --> 00:23:01,297
No, you're not. If you were, you'd be able to give me some answers.

423
00:23:02,055 --> 00:23:05,036
I put you on the bypass machine, which pumps blood for your heart.

424
00:23:05,286 --> 00:23:08,993
Fix your ticker, take you off the machine -- I'm done -- simple procedure.

425
00:23:09,823 --> 00:23:11,839
So I shouldn't worry?

426
00:23:12,123 --> 00:23:13,759
I'm very good at what I do.

427
00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:15,394
But still it's surgery.

428
00:23:15,464 --> 00:23:16,653
There are some risks.

429
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:19,012
I'll see you in the O.R. this afternoon, Mr. Savitch.

430
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:24,563
You're not gonna leave me alone with that guy, are you?

431
00:23:26,191 --> 00:23:28,389
Oh, I'll be outside the O.R. the whole time.

432
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,095
No, Dr. Burke is very good.

433
00:23:31,556 --> 00:23:32,474
Don't worry.

434
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,031
I'll see you after.

435
00:23:34,363 --> 00:23:35,945
He'll be fine, right?

436
00:23:36,022 --> 00:23:37,358
Tony's gonna sail through it.

437
00:23:40,235 --> 00:23:42,878
You have nothing to worry about -- I promise.

438
00:23:44,597 --> 00:23:45,693
I gotta go.

439
00:23:46,671 --> 00:23:47,568
What are you doing?

440
00:23:47,814 --> 00:23:51,771
I'm suturing a banana with the vain hope that it wakes up my brain.

441
00:23:52,749 --> 00:23:54,706
What are you smiling at, 007?

442
00:23:55,724 --> 00:23:57,711
I'm sorry. I get mean when I'm tired.

443
00:23:57,793 --> 00:23:58,561
You know what?

444
00:23:58,957 --> 00:24:00,204
I don't care.

445
00:24:00,947 --> 00:24:05,084
I comforted a family, and I got to hang out in the O.R. today. All is well.

446
00:24:05,155 --> 00:24:06,603
Does anybody know why we're here?

447
00:24:07,254 --> 00:24:08,222
Well, good morning.

448
00:24:10,262 --> 00:24:12,139
I'm gonna do something pretty rare for a surgeon.

449
00:24:12,462 --> 00:24:14,192
I'm gonna ask interns for help.

450
00:24:14,837 --> 00:24:16,533
I've got this kid, Katie Bryce.

451
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:18,712
Right now, she's a mystery.

452
00:24:19,603 --> 00:24:21,099
She doesn't respond to our meds.

453
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:23,338
The labs are clean, the scans are pure,

454
00:24:23,582 --> 00:24:27,254
but she's having seizures -- grand mal seizures with no visible cause.

455
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,030
She's a ticking clock.

456
00:24:29,287 --> 00:24:32,880
She's gonna die if I don't make a diagnosis, which is where you come in.

457
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,513
I can't do it alone.

458
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:37,418
I need your extra minds, extra eyes.

459
00:24:37,631 --> 00:24:40,997
I need you to play detective. I need you to find out why katie is having seizures.

460
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:45,291
I know you're tired. You're busy. You got more work than you can possibly handle.

461
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,486
I understand, so I'm gonna give you an incentive.

462
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,287
Whoever finds the answer rides with me.

463
00:24:51,707 --> 00:24:52,921
Katie needs surgery.

464
00:24:53,482 --> 00:24:57,984
You get to do what no interns get to do -- scrub in to assist on an advanced procedure.

465
00:24:58,495 --> 00:25:00,390
Dr. Bailey's gonna hand you Katie's chart.

466
00:25:00,462 --> 00:25:02,004
The clock is ticking fast, people.

467
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,133
If we're gonna save katie's life, we have to do it soon.

468
00:25:12,254 --> 00:25:13,881
Look, give the antibiotics time to work.

469
00:25:13,968 --> 00:25:15,694
The antibiotics should have worked by now.

470
00:25:15,904 --> 00:25:17,701
She's old. She's freaking ancient.

471
00:25:17,831 --> 00:25:19,402
She's lucky she's still breathing.

472
00:25:20,092 --> 00:25:24,317
I got a shot to scrub in downstairs on a patient that wasn't alive during the civil war.

473
00:25:24,387 --> 00:25:25,837
Don't page me again.

474
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,692
Hey, I want in on shepherd's surgery.

475
00:25:32,786 --> 00:25:34,372
You've been the intern on Katie since the start.

476
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,689
You want to work together?

477
00:25:35,806 --> 00:25:38,227
If we find the answer, we have a 50-50 chance of scrubbing in.

478
00:25:38,321 --> 00:25:41,479
I'll work with you, but I don't want in on the surgery. You can have it.

479
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:43,793
You're kidding? It's the biggest opportunity any intern will ever get.

480
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,980
I don't want to spend any more time with Shepherd than I have to.

481
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:47,158
What do you have against shepherd?

482
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,819
If we find the answer, the surgery's yours. Do you want to work together or not?

483
00:25:51,489 --> 00:25:52,164
Deal.

484
00:25:52,241 --> 00:25:55,313
So she doesn't have anoxia, chronic renal failure, or acidosis.

485
00:25:55,384 --> 00:25:57,796
It's not a tumor, because her C.T.'s clean.

486
00:25:58,494 --> 00:26:00,783
Are you seriously not gonna tell me why you won't work with Shepherd?

487
00:26:00,848 --> 00:26:01,497
No.

488
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,662
What about infection?

489
00:26:02,743 --> 00:26:06,291
No, there's no white count, and she has no C.T. lesions, no fevers,

490
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:09,113
nothing in her spinal tap. Just tell me.

491
00:26:10,889 --> 00:26:14,080
You can't comment, make a face, or react in any way.

492
00:26:16,066 --> 00:26:17,084
We had sex.

493
00:26:21,027 --> 00:26:22,455
What about an aneurysm?

494
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,980
No blood on the C.T. and no headaches.

495
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:29,464
Okay, there's no drug use, no pregnancy, no trauma.

496
00:26:31,804 --> 00:26:32,823
Was he good?

497
00:26:33,202 --> 00:26:35,553
I mean, he looks like he'd be good. Was it any good?

498
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:39,362
We're out of answers.

499
00:26:41,526 --> 00:26:43,109
What if no one comes up with anything?

500
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:44,400
You mean what if she dies?

501
00:26:44,486 --> 00:26:45,321
Yeah.

502
00:26:46,888 --> 00:26:50,493
This is gonna sound really bad, but I really wanted that surgery.

503
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,809
She's just never gonna get the chance to turn into a person.

504
00:26:54,942 --> 00:26:59,841
The sum total of her existence will be almost winning miss teen whatever.

505
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:03,744
You know what her pageant talent is?

506
00:27:03,824 --> 00:27:04,799
They have talent?

507
00:27:05,305 --> 00:27:07,020
Rhythmic gymnastics.

508
00:27:07,281 --> 00:27:09,150
Oh, come on.

509
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:14,372
What is rhythmic gymnastics? I can't even say it. I don't know what it is.

510
00:27:17,061 --> 00:27:20,015
I think it's something with a ball and a --

511
00:27:21,551 --> 00:27:22,298
What?

512
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,032
Meredith, what?

513
00:27:25,134 --> 00:27:26,482
Get up. Come on.

514
00:27:27,836 --> 00:27:30,491
The only thing that she wouldpossibly need is an angiogram.

515
00:27:30,711 --> 00:27:32,703
Oh. Oh, Dr. Shepherd, just one moment.

516
00:27:33,364 --> 00:27:35,466
Katie competes in beauty pageants.

517
00:27:35,555 --> 00:27:37,427
I know that, but we have to save her life, anyway.

518
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:40,372
She has no headaches, no neck pain, her C.T. is clean.

519
00:27:40,495 --> 00:27:43,423
- There's no medical proof of an aneurysm. 
- Right.

520
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:46,198
- But what if she has an aneurysm, anyway?
- There are no indicators.

521
00:27:46,286 --> 00:27:49,260
She twisted her ankle practicing for the pageant.

522
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:53,080
- I appreciate you trying to help, but -- 
- She fell when she twisted her ankle, she fell.

523
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:58,266
It was no big deal, not even a bump on the head. She got up, iced her ankle, and everything was fine.

524
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,830
It was a fall so minor, her doctor didn't even think to mention it when I was taking her history,

525
00:28:01,912 --> 00:28:04,011
but she did fall.

526
00:28:04,251 --> 00:28:06,462
You know what the chance is that a minor fall could burst an aneurysm?

527
00:28:06,531 --> 00:28:08,000
One in a million -- literally.

528
00:28:15,846 --> 00:28:17,124
Let's go.

529
00:28:17,267 --> 00:28:17,763
Where?

530
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,571
To find out if Katie's one in a million.

531
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:38,663
I'll be damned.

532
00:28:39,627 --> 00:28:40,446
There it is.

533
00:28:43,005 --> 00:28:44,654
It's minute, but it's there.

534
00:28:46,078 --> 00:28:47,721
It's a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

535
00:28:49,026 --> 00:28:51,002
She's bleeding into her brain.

536
00:28:56,288 --> 00:28:59,297
She could have gone through her entire life without it ever being a problem.

537
00:28:59,384 --> 00:29:00,931
- One tap in the right spot... 
- And it exploded.

538
00:29:00,993 --> 00:29:02,620
Exactly. Now I can fix it.

539
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:04,935
You two did great work.

540
00:29:05,129 --> 00:29:08,207
Love to stay and kiss your asses, but I got to tell Katie's parents she's having surgery.

541
00:29:08,293 --> 00:29:09,921
- Katie Bryce's chart, please.
- Here you go.

542
00:29:11,687 --> 00:29:15,927
Dr. Shepherd, you'd said that you'd pick someone to scrub in if we helped?

543
00:29:16,014 --> 00:29:18,948
Oh, yes, right. I'm sorry I can't take you both.

544
00:29:19,003 --> 00:29:20,264
It's gonna be a full house.

545
00:29:20,407 --> 00:29:21,886
Meredith, I'll see you in O.R.

546
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:30,934
Good. Thank you.

547
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:40,831
Cristina...

548
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,659
Wow, that was quick.

549
00:30:44,739 --> 00:30:47,265
His heart had too much damage to give him a bypass.

550
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:49,580
I had to let him go.

551
00:30:50,655 --> 00:30:53,409
It happens -- rarely, but it does happen --

552
00:30:53,598 --> 00:30:54,949
the worst part of the game.

553
00:30:57,229 --> 00:31:02,092
But I told his wife -- I told gloria that he would be fine.

554
00:31:03,634 --> 00:31:05,615
- I promised her that -- 
- You what?

555
00:31:05,815 --> 00:31:09,102
- They have four little girls. 
- This is my case.

556
00:31:09,184 --> 00:31:10,796
Did you hear me promise?

557
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:15,375
The only one that can keep a promise like that is god, and I haven't seen him holding a scalpel lately.

558
00:31:15,451 --> 00:31:18,626
You never promise a patient's family a good outcome!

559
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,390
I thought...

560
00:31:21,584 --> 00:31:23,980
You're important enough to make promises to Mrs. Savitch?

561
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:26,557
You get to be the one to tell her that she's a widow.

562
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:39,555
Izzie.

563
00:31:42,962 --> 00:31:44,880
- Maybe Meredith couldn't -- 
- Izzie.

564
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:53,943
- I'll tell him I changed my mind.
- Don't do me any favors. It's fine.

565
00:31:54,563 --> 00:31:57,333
- Cristina -- 
- You did a cutthroat thing. Deal with it.

566
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:00,456
Don't come to me for absolution. You want to be a shark, be a shark.

567
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,836
- I'm not -- 
- Oh, yes, you are.

568
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:05,847
Only it makes you feel all bad in your warm, gooey places.

569
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:07,368
No, screw you.

570
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,549
I don't get picked for surgeries 'cause I slept with my boss,

571
00:32:09,615 --> 00:32:11,746
and I didn't get into med school 'cause I have a famous mother.

572
00:32:11,812 --> 00:32:13,885
Some of us have to earn what we get.

573
00:32:26,543 --> 00:32:29,778
Gloria, there were complications in the surgery.

574
00:32:31,431 --> 00:32:34,264
Tony's heart had a lot of damage.

575
00:32:34,977 --> 00:32:38,984
We tried to take him off bypass, but...

576
00:32:41,268 --> 00:32:43,224
there wasn't anything we could have done.

577
00:32:45,848 --> 00:32:47,556
What are you talking about?

578
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:49,546
He...

579
00:32:51,985 --> 00:32:53,090
Tony died.

580
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:54,523
He's dead.

581
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,330
Gloria...

582
00:32:58,292 --> 00:32:59,189
I am so sorry.

583
00:33:05,131 --> 00:33:06,047
Please...

584
00:33:08,435 --> 00:33:09,552
go away.

585
00:33:36,963 --> 00:33:38,464
I promised I'd make her look cool.

586
00:33:38,765 --> 00:33:42,714
Apparently, being a bald beauty queen is the worst thing that happened in the history of the world.

587
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:47,968
Did you choose me for the surgery because I slept with you?

588
00:33:48,504 --> 00:33:49,308
Yes.

589
00:33:52,396 --> 00:33:53,323
I'm kidding.

590
00:33:54,468 --> 00:33:56,277
I'm not gonna scrub in for surgery.

591
00:33:56,383 --> 00:33:58,238
You should ask Cristina. She really wants it.

592
00:33:58,324 --> 00:33:59,548
You're Katie's doctor.

593
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:03,455
And on your first day, with very little training, you helped save her life.

594
00:34:03,547 --> 00:34:06,992
You earned the right to follow her case through to the finish.

595
00:34:07,229 --> 00:34:12,102
You shouldn't let the fact that we had sex get in the way of you taking your shot.

596
00:34:26,095 --> 00:34:28,086
I wish I wanted to be a chef

597
00:34:28,527 --> 00:34:31,646
or a ski instructor or a kindergarten teacher.

598
00:34:32,895 --> 00:34:35,587
You know, I would have been a really good postal worker.

599
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:37,769
I'm dependable.

600
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:43,602
You know, my parents tell everyone they meet that their son's a surgeon,

601
00:34:43,862 --> 00:34:45,751
as if it's a big accomplishment --

602
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,628
superhero or something.

603
00:34:51,066 --> 00:34:52,653
If they could see me now.

604
00:34:55,935 --> 00:34:58,608
When I told my mother I wanted to go to medical school,

605
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,213
she tried to talk me out of it --

606
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:05,039
said I didn't have what it takes to be a surgeon,

607
00:35:05,781 --> 00:35:07,266
that I'd never make it.

608
00:35:08,382 --> 00:35:13,113
So the way I see it, superhero sounds pretty damn good.

609
00:35:17,623 --> 00:35:19,426
We're gonna survive this, right?

610
00:35:26,814 --> 00:35:29,681
She's still short of breath. Did you get an abg or a chest film?

611
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:30,859
Oh, yes, sir, I did.

612
00:35:30,956 --> 00:35:32,068
And what did you see?

613
00:35:32,753 --> 00:35:35,287
Oh, well, I had a lot of patients last night.

614
00:35:35,373 --> 00:35:37,498
Name the common causes of post-op fever.

615
00:35:37,623 --> 00:35:40,879
- Uh, yes.
- From your head, not from a book.

616
00:35:40,971 --> 00:35:45,288
Don't look it up. Learn it. It should be in your head. Name the common causes of post-op fever.

617
00:35:45,385 --> 00:35:49,167
Uh... the common causes of post--

618
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,657
Can anybody name the common causes of post-op fever?

619
00:35:54,516 --> 00:35:59,777
Wind, Water, Wound, Walking, Wonder drugs -- the five W's --

620
00:35:59,987 --> 00:36:01,743
most of the time, it's Wind --

621
00:36:01,856 --> 00:36:03,428
splinting or pneumonia.

622
00:36:04,543 --> 00:36:08,711
Pneumonia's easy to assume, especially if you're too busy to do the tests.

623
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,905
What do you think's wrong with 4-b?

624
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,703
The fourth "W," "Walking."

625
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:20,391
I think she's a prime candidate for a pulmonary embolus.

626
00:36:20,497 --> 00:36:21,635
How would you diagnose?

627
00:36:23,923 --> 00:36:27,922
Spiral C.T., V/Q scan, provide O2,

628
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:31,685
dose with heparin, and consult for an IVC filter.

629
00:36:33,222 --> 00:36:37,747
Do exactly as she says, then tell your resident that I want you off this case.

630
00:36:39,202 --> 00:36:42,202
I'd know you anywhere. You're the spitting image of your mother.

631
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:44,204
Welcome to the game.

632
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:05,304
All right, everybody. It's a beautiful night to save lives.

633
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,025
Let's have some fun.

634
00:37:16,754 --> 00:37:20,117
I can't think of any one reason why I want to be a surgeon...

635
00:37:22,261 --> 00:37:25,200
but I can think of a thousand reasons why I should quit.

636
00:37:40,109 --> 00:37:41,944
They make it hard on purpose.

637
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,353
There are lives in our hands.

638
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:01,558
There comes a moment when it's more than just a game...

639
00:38:12,828 --> 00:38:14,958
And you either take that step forward

640
00:38:16,136 --> 00:38:18,081
or turn around and walk away.

641
00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:38,868
I could quit,

642
00:38:39,472 --> 00:38:40,655
but here's the thing...

643
00:38:44,163 --> 00:38:45,611
I love the playing field.

644
00:38:54,412 --> 00:38:56,127
- It was good surgery.
- Yeah.

645
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:09,296
We don't have to do that thing where I say something, and then you say something,

646
00:39:09,378 --> 00:39:12,645
and then somebody cries, and there's a moment.

647
00:39:12,742 --> 00:39:13,530
Yuck.

648
00:39:14,263 --> 00:39:14,923
Good.

649
00:39:18,963 --> 00:39:20,279
You should get some sleep.

650
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:21,487
You look like crap.

651
00:39:22,476 --> 00:39:23,909
I look better than you.

652
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:25,932
That's not possible.

653
00:39:43,529 --> 00:39:44,885
That was amazing.

654
00:39:49,796 --> 00:39:51,829
You practice on cadavers...

655
00:39:53,436 --> 00:39:54,589
you observe...

656
00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:59,141
and you think you know what you're gonna feel like, standing over that table, but...

657
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,222
that was such a high.

658
00:40:06,933 --> 00:40:09,200
I don't know why anybody does drugs.

659
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:12,683
Yeah.

660
00:40:18,212 --> 00:40:19,103
Yeah.

661
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:24,955
I should, uh, go do this.

662
00:40:27,152 --> 00:40:28,012
You should.

663
00:40:32,372 --> 00:40:33,419
I'll see you around.

664
00:40:34,955 --> 00:40:35,963
See you around.

665
00:40:37,141 --> 00:40:37,930
See you.

666
00:40:43,245 --> 00:40:44,206
So...

667
00:40:44,744 --> 00:40:46,803
I made it through my first shift.

668
00:40:47,703 --> 00:40:48,784
We all did.

669
00:40:50,643 --> 00:40:53,617
The other interns are all good people. You'd like them...

670
00:40:54,893 --> 00:40:55,813
I think.

671
00:40:57,565 --> 00:40:59,477
I don't know -- maybe.

672
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:01,958
I like them.

673
00:41:07,949 --> 00:41:09,766
Oh, and I changed my mind.

674
00:41:09,986 --> 00:41:11,569
I'm not gonna sell the house.

675
00:41:12,286 --> 00:41:13,361
I'm gonna keep it.

676
00:41:15,249 --> 00:41:17,477
I'll have to get a couple of roommates, but...

677
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:19,703
it's home, you know?

678
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:24,977
Are you the doctor?

679
00:41:25,807 --> 00:41:26,524
No.

680
00:41:27,931 --> 00:41:29,305
I'm not your doctor,

681
00:41:29,991 --> 00:41:31,394
but I am a doctor.

682
00:41:38,177 --> 00:41:39,232
What's your name?

683
00:41:42,274 --> 00:41:44,413
It's me, mom -- Meredith.

684
00:41:47,895 --> 00:41:48,837
All right.

685
00:41:55,698 --> 00:41:57,633
I used to be a doctor, I think.

686
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:10,469
You were a doctor, mom.

687
00:42:11,007 --> 00:42:12,189
You were a surgeon.

688
00:42:16,943 --> 00:42:21,565
