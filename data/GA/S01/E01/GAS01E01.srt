1
00:00:03,952 --> 00:00:04,950
The game -

2
00:00:05,943 --> 00:00:09,684
they say a person either has what it
takes to play or they don't.

3
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:13,161
My mother was one of the greats.

4
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,410
Me, on the other hand -

5
00:00:15,747 --> 00:00:17,605
I'm kind of screwed.

6
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:39,552
This is, uh...

7
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:41,875
Humiliating on so many levels.

8
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:42,869
You have to go.

9
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,996
Why don't you just come back down here,
and we'll pick up where we left off?

10
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:48,209
No, seriously. You have to go. I'm late,

11
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,988
which isn't what you want to be on
 your first day of work, so...

12
00:00:51,068 --> 00:00:53,652
So, uh, you actually live here.

13
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:54,611
No.

14
00:00:55,617 --> 00:00:57,537
Yes, kind of.

15
00:01:00,762 --> 00:01:02,791
It's nice - a little dusty -

16
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:04,454
odd, but it's nice.

17
00:01:05,852 --> 00:01:07,153
So, how do you kind of live here?

18
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:11,259
I moved two weeks ago from Boston.
 It was my mother's house. I'm selling it.

19
00:01:11,326 --> 00:01:12,247
Oh, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:13,752
For what?

21
00:01:14,146 --> 00:01:15,254
You said "was."

22
00:01:15,396 --> 00:01:17,955
Oh, my mother's not dead. She's -

23
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:19,923
You know what?
We don't have to do the thing.

24
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:22,201
Oh, we can do anything you want.

25
00:01:22,385 --> 00:01:25,504
No, the thing - exchange the details,
pretend we care.

26
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,843
I'm gonna go upstairs and take
a shower, okay?

27
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:31,635
And when I get back down here,
you won't be here, so, um...

28
00:01:32,328 --> 00:01:35,281
goodbye, um...

29
00:01:37,817 --> 00:01:38,723
Derek.

30
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,894
Derek. Right. Meredith.

31
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:41,591
Meredith.

32
00:01:41,662 --> 00:01:43,526
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

33
00:01:44,068 --> 00:01:45,599
- Nice meeting you.
- Bye, Derek.

34
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:08,287
Each of you comes here today hopeful,

35
00:02:08,403 --> 00:02:09,925
wanting in on the game.

36
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:13,569
A month ago, you were in med school,
 being taught by doctors.

37
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:15,793
Today...

38
00:02:16,714 --> 00:02:18,399
you are the doctors.

39
00:02:20,845 --> 00:02:23,035
The 7 years you spend here
as a surgical resident

40
00:02:23,048 --> 00:02:25,249
will be the best and
worst of your life.

41
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,302
You will be pushed to the breaking point.

42
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,017
Look around you.

43
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,963
Say hello to your competition.

44
00:02:31,837 --> 00:02:34,510
Eight of you will switch to
an easier specialty.

45
00:02:34,584 --> 00:02:36,452
Five of you will crack under the pressure.

46
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:38,173
Two of you will be asked to leave.

47
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,286
This is your starting line.

48
00:02:40,562 --> 00:02:42,109
This is your arena.

49
00:02:42,755 --> 00:02:44,095
How well you play...

50
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,224
that's up to you.

51
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:49,702
Like I said...

52
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:52,164
I'm screwed.

53
00:03:03,453 --> 00:03:07,087
Okay, Martin, Robinson, Bond, Hawkins.

54
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:13,140
Only 6 women out of 20.

55
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:15,465
Yeah. I hear one of them's a model.

56
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:18,521
Seriously, that's gonna help
 with the respect thing?

57
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:21,696
- You're Cristina, right?
- Patton, Monroe...

58
00:03:23,308 --> 00:03:25,136
Which resident are you assigned to?
 I got bailey.

59
00:03:25,309 --> 00:03:26,851
The Nazi? Me too.

60
00:03:26,928 --> 00:03:28,818
You got the Nazi? So did I.

61
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,723
At least we'll be tortured together, right?

62
00:03:31,281 --> 00:03:33,498
I'm George O’Malley.

63
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:37,274
Uh, we met at the mixer.
You had on a black dress

64
00:03:37,287 --> 00:03:40,982
with a slit up the side,
strappy sandals...

65
00:03:42,864 --> 00:03:45,366
Now you think I'm gay. No, I'm not gay.

66
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:50,726
It's - it's just that you were - you
 were very unforgettable.

67
00:03:50,885 --> 00:03:53,784
O’Malley, Yang, Grey, Stevens.

68
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:56,174
And I'm totally forgettable.

69
00:03:57,358 --> 00:03:58,888
- Bailey?
- End of the hall.

70
00:04:00,552 --> 00:04:01,847
That's the Nazi?

71
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,023
I thought the Nazi would be a guy.

72
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:07,306
I thought the Nazi would be a Nazi.

73
00:04:07,424 --> 00:04:09,077
Maybe it's professional jealousy.

74
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:12,221
Maybe she's brilliant, and they call her
a Nazi because they're jealous.

75
00:04:12,422 --> 00:04:13,363
Maybe she's nice.

76
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:14,914
Let me guess - you're the model.

77
00:04:16,107 --> 00:04:18,995
Hi, I'm Isobel Stevens, but
everyone calls me "Izzie."

78
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,044
I have five rules. Memorize them.

79
00:04:23,106 --> 00:04:26,870
Rule number one - don't bother sucking up.
 I already hate you. That's not gonna change.

80
00:04:26,952 --> 00:04:31,325
Trauma protocol, phone list,
pagers - nurses will page you.

81
00:04:31,426 --> 00:04:35,752
You will answer every page at a run -
 a run - that's rule number two.

82
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:39,500
Your first shift starts now and
 lasts 48 hours.

83
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:43,904
You're interns, grunts, nobodies,
bottom of the surgical food chain.

84
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:48,173
You run labs, write orders, work every second
night until you drop, and don't complain.

85
00:04:48,256 --> 00:04:51,124
On-call rooms - attendings hog them.

86
00:04:51,179 --> 00:04:53,851
Sleep when you can where you can,
which brings me to rule number three.

87
00:04:53,913 --> 00:04:57,994
If I'm sleeping, don't wake me unless
your patient is actually dying.

88
00:04:58,061 --> 00:05:00,791
Rule number four - the dying patient
better not be dead when I get there.

89
00:05:00,852 --> 00:05:04,732
Not only will you have killed someone, you would
have woke me for no good reason. We clear?

90
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:05,997
Yes?

91
00:05:06,094 --> 00:05:08,716
You said five rules. That was only four.

92
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:12,346
Rule number five - when I move, you move.

93
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:15,135
Get out of my way!

94
00:05:30,382 --> 00:05:31,162
What do we got?

95
00:05:31,244 --> 00:05:36,103
Katie Bryce, 15-year-old female, new onset
seizures, intermittent for the past week.

96
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:39,851
I.V. lost en route, started grand
mal seizing as we descended.

97
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:41,351
All right, get her on her side.

98
00:05:42,063 --> 00:05:44,526
Izzie, 10 milligrams diazepam I.M.

99
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:47,506
No, no. The white lead is on the right.

100
00:05:47,573 --> 00:05:49,645
Righty, whity - smoke over fire.

101
00:05:49,768 --> 00:05:52,820
A large-bore I.V. Don't let
the blood hemolyze. Let's go!

102
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,177
What do we have? A wet fish on dry land.

103
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:01,872
Absolutely, Dr. Burke.

104
00:06:03,157 --> 00:06:05,415
Dr. Bailey, let's shotgun her.

105
00:06:05,497 --> 00:06:09,593
That means every test in the book
- C.T., CBC, chem-7, tox screen.

106
00:06:09,655 --> 00:06:12,707
Cristina, you're on labs.
George, patient work-ups.

107
00:06:12,808 --> 00:06:14,769
Meredith, get Katie for a C.T.

108
00:06:14,862 --> 00:06:16,930
She's your responsibility now.

109
00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:18,435
Wait. What about me?

110
00:06:20,058 --> 00:06:22,317
Honey, you get to do rectal exams.

111
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:39,351
What are you doing here?

112
00:06:40,128 --> 00:06:42,119
Katie Bryce's labs came out clear.
There's nothing

113
00:06:42,132 --> 00:06:44,133
in the results that
explain her seizures.

114
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,911
- I just thought you wanna know.
- Okay.

115
00:06:46,192 --> 00:06:50,149
I heard every year, the attending
on call picks the best intern

116
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,006
and lets them perform a procedure
during the first shift.

117
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:57,804
I'm just saying it's what I heard.

118
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,031
Go away... now.

119
00:07:01,335 --> 00:07:02,653
Yeah, sounds good.

120
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:03,564
He'll be fine?

121
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:04,479
You'll be fine.

122
00:07:04,604 --> 00:07:07,597
If you don't count the fact that
my bacon days are over, sure.

123
00:07:07,696 --> 00:07:10,644
So, bypass surgery tomorrow with Dr. Burke
- I hear he's good.

124
00:07:10,716 --> 00:07:14,581
And, after that, you can have all the
bacon-flavored soy product you can eat.

125
00:07:14,653 --> 00:07:16,113
Mmm. Kill me now.

126
00:07:16,225 --> 00:07:19,056
I wish I could, but I'm a healer.

127
00:07:22,145 --> 00:07:23,148
You're lost.

128
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:25,724
I'm not lost.

129
00:07:25,826 --> 00:07:26,870
How are you feeling?

130
00:07:26,941 --> 00:07:28,513
How do you think I'm feeling?

131
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:30,008
I'm missing my pageant.

132
00:07:30,085 --> 00:07:31,330
You're missing your pageant?

133
00:07:31,402 --> 00:07:33,008
The Spokane teen miss.

134
00:07:33,102 --> 00:07:35,722
I was in the top 10 after the first 2 rounds.

135
00:07:35,815 --> 00:07:37,033
This is my year.

136
00:07:37,135 --> 00:07:38,236
I could have won.

137
00:07:38,856 --> 00:07:39,711
Hello.

138
00:07:40,612 --> 00:07:43,059
You're so lost. What are you, like, new?

139
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:49,900
Okay, so I'm just gonna insert
my fingers into your rectum.

140
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:57,759
No.

141
00:08:00,835 --> 00:08:01,553
Out.

142
00:08:02,414 --> 00:08:03,074
Out.

143
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:07,272
Bet you missed a lot when you first started out.

144
00:08:10,754 --> 00:08:12,668
I twisted my ankle in talent rehearsal.

145
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:15,757
I do rhythmic gymnastics,
which is, like, really cool.

146
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:16,949
Nobody else does it.

147
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,568
And I tripped over my ribbon. And I didn't
get stuck with someone this clueless,

148
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:24,272
and that was, like, a nurse.

149
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:26,841
You and I are gonna have so much fun together.

150
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,999
This shift is a marathon, not a sprint. Eat.

151
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:37,895
I can't.

152
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,001
You should eat something.

153
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:43,247
You try eating after performing 17 rectal exams.
The Nazi hates me.

154
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:46,266
The Nazi’s a resident. I
have attendings hating me.

155
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:47,767
You know Meredith is inbred?

156
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:50,342
Like it's uncommon around here
to be a doctors' parents -

157
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,555
No, royally inbred - her mother is Ellis Grey.

158
00:08:52,596 --> 00:08:53,756
Shut up. The Ellis Grey?

159
00:08:54,043 --> 00:08:54,853
Who's Ellis Grey?

160
00:08:55,855 --> 00:08:58,356
The Grey Method. Where'd you go to med school
- Mexico?

161
00:08:58,447 --> 00:09:01,057
She was one of the first big chick surgeons.

162
00:09:01,204 --> 00:09:04,028
She's a living legend. Yeah, she
won the harper Avery twice.

163
00:09:04,105 --> 00:09:05,569
So I didn't know one thing.

164
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:07,028
Talk about parental pressure.

165
00:09:07,097 --> 00:09:09,180
God, I would kill to have
Ellis Grey as a mother.

166
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:11,032
I'd kill to be Ellis Grey.

167
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,640
All I need is one good case.

168
00:09:14,157 --> 00:09:16,578
Katie Bryce is a pain in the ass.

169
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:20,396
If I hadn't taken the hippocratic oath,
I'd Kevorkian her with my bare hands.

170
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:22,875
What?

171
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:25,522
Good afternoon, interns.

172
00:09:27,052 --> 00:09:30,606
It's posted, but I thought I'd
share the good news personally.

173
00:09:30,678 --> 00:09:33,950
As you know, the honor of
performing the first surgery

174
00:09:33,993 --> 00:09:37,375
is reserved for the intern
that shows the most promise.

175
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:40,980
As I'm running the O.R. today,
I get to make that choice.

176
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:44,333
George O’Malley.

177
00:09:44,415 --> 00:09:45,127
Me?

178
00:09:45,306 --> 00:09:47,482
You'll scrub in for an
appendectomy this afternoon.

179
00:09:47,575 --> 00:09:48,630
Congratulations.

180
00:09:48,947 --> 00:09:49,735
Enjoy it.

181
00:09:56,489 --> 00:09:57,589
Did he say me?

182
00:09:58,067 --> 00:10:01,884
I've seen his file. George O’Malley barely
made the cut to get in this program.

183
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:03,129
He's not your guy.

184
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:04,266
He's my guy, all right.

185
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:08,413
Every year, you pick your guy, and every year,
your guy suffers more than any other intern.

186
00:10:08,469 --> 00:10:10,553
Terrorize one, and the rest fall in line.

187
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,598
I get it, I respect it, but
George O’Malley’s a puppy.

188
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,467
- Katie Bryce - 3604?
- It's right there.

189
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:17,341
Thank you.

190
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:19,968
Katie, honey, mom and dad are here.

191
00:10:20,056 --> 00:10:23,441
They gave her a sedative for the C.T.
scan, so she's a little groggy.

192
00:10:23,517 --> 00:10:24,796
Will she be all right?

193
00:10:24,946 --> 00:10:29,109
Our doctor at home said that she might
need an operation. Is that true?

194
00:10:29,174 --> 00:10:30,316
What kind of operation?

195
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:32,784
She's, um - well...

196
00:10:33,615 --> 00:10:35,687
You know what? I'm not the doctor.

197
00:10:35,872 --> 00:10:40,971
I'm a doctor, but I'm not Katie's
doctor, so I'll go get him for you.

198
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,682
What?

199
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:49,026
Katie's parents have questions. Do
you talk to them, or do I ask Burke?

200
00:10:49,153 --> 00:10:51,427
No, Burke's off the case.
Katie belongs to the new

201
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,725
attending now, Dr. Shepherd.
He's over there.

202
00:11:15,404 --> 00:11:16,685
Dr. Shepherd.

203
00:11:16,952 --> 00:11:18,068
Dr. Shepherd?

204
00:11:18,775 --> 00:11:20,234
This morning, it was Derek.

205
00:11:20,637 --> 00:11:22,189
Now it's Dr. Shepherd.

206
00:11:22,369 --> 00:11:24,422
Dr. Shepherd, we should
pretend it never happened.

207
00:11:24,498 --> 00:11:28,384
What never happened - you sleeping with me last
night, or you throwing me out this morning?

208
00:11:28,456 --> 00:11:30,663
Because both are fond memories
I'd like to hold onto.

209
00:11:30,755 --> 00:11:33,146
No, there will be no memories.

210
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,023
I'm not the girl in the bar
anymore, and you're not the guy.

211
00:11:36,223 --> 00:11:37,481
This can't exist.

212
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:38,952
You get that, right?

213
00:11:39,223 --> 00:11:41,159
You took advantage of me, and now
you want to forget about it.

214
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,067
I was drunk, vulnerable, and
good-looking, and you took advantage.

215
00:11:44,164 --> 00:11:47,386
Okay, I was the one who was drunk,
and you are not that good-looking.

216
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:48,579
Maybe not today.

217
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:52,373
Last night, I was very good-looking. I
had my red shirt on. You took advantage.

218
00:11:52,475 --> 00:11:54,114
I did not take advantage.

219
00:11:54,127 --> 00:11:55,777
Want to take advantage
again - say, friday night?

220
00:11:57,615 --> 00:11:58,496
No.

221
00:11:59,704 --> 00:12:02,274
You're an attending, and I'm your intern.

222
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:04,850
Stop looking at me like that.

223
00:12:05,027 --> 00:12:05,710
Like what?

224
00:12:05,777 --> 00:12:07,205
Like you've seen me naked.

225
00:12:08,491 --> 00:12:12,278
Dr. Shepherd, this is inappropriate.

226
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,399
Has that ever occurred to you?

227
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:22,407
Open, identify, ligate, remove, irrigate, close.

228
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:25,432
Open, identify, ligate, remove, irrigate, close.

229
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:26,891
He's gonna faint. He's a fainter.

230
00:12:26,989 --> 00:12:28,930
No, code brown, right in his pants.

231
00:12:28,996 --> 00:12:31,552
He's all about the flop sweat. He's
gonna sweat himself unsterile.

232
00:12:31,613 --> 00:12:33,271
10 bucks says he messes up the Mcburney.

233
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,111
$15 says he cries.

234
00:12:34,162 --> 00:12:35,580
I'll put $20 on a total meltdown.

235
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:38,002
$50 says he pulls the whole thing off.

236
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:43,814
That's one of us down
there, the first one of us.

237
00:12:43,886 --> 00:12:45,295
Where's your loyalty?

238
00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:50,843
- $75 says he can't even I.D. the appendix.
- I'll take that action.

239
00:12:50,993 --> 00:12:53,603
Okay, O’Malley, let's see what you can do.

240
00:12:54,642 --> 00:12:55,903
Here it comes.

241
00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:00,542
Scalpel.

242
00:13:00,915 --> 00:13:01,545
Scalpel.

243
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:08,165
That burke is trouble.

244
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:14,262
More pressure.

245
00:13:14,534 --> 00:13:16,967
The human flesh is a tough shell. Dig in.

246
00:13:20,914 --> 00:13:21,569
Pickups.

247
00:13:22,142 --> 00:13:22,803
Pickups.

248
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:26,617
Clamp.

249
00:13:27,283 --> 00:13:27,933
Clamp.

250
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:38,507
I'm there.

251
00:13:38,594 --> 00:13:40,580
Damn, he got the peritoneum open. I'm out.

252
00:13:40,678 --> 00:13:42,454
I told you - he's gonna pull it off.

253
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:52,259
Scalpel.

254
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:53,288
Scalpel.

255
00:13:56,918 --> 00:13:58,053
Appendix is out.

256
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,747
Not bad.

257
00:14:01,305 --> 00:14:02,029
Thank you.

258
00:14:02,386 --> 00:14:06,815
Now all you have to do is
invert the stump into the cecum

259
00:14:07,303 --> 00:14:11,115
and simultaneously pull up on the purse strings,

260
00:14:11,274 --> 00:14:12,953
but be careful not to...

261
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,135
break them.

262
00:14:16,415 --> 00:14:18,319
You ripped the cecum.

263
00:14:18,611 --> 00:14:19,425
You've got a bleeder.

264
00:14:19,507 --> 00:14:21,427
You're filling with stool. What do you do now?

265
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:22,308
Uh...

266
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,474
Think. You start the suction,
and you start digging

267
00:14:26,487 --> 00:14:29,066
for those purse strings
before she bleeds to death.

268
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,587
Give him a clamp.

269
00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:31,729
B.P.'s dropping.

270
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,086
He's choking.

271
00:14:33,285 --> 00:14:34,325
Come on, George.

272
00:14:34,427 --> 00:14:37,577
Today. Pull your balls out
of your back pocket. Let's go.

273
00:14:38,101 --> 00:14:39,522
What are you waiting for? Suction.

274
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:42,813
Getting too low, folks.

275
00:14:44,498 --> 00:14:45,558
Dr. Burke.

276
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:46,828
Get out of the way.

277
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:48,835
Pansy-ass idiot.

278
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:49,874
Get him out of here.

279
00:14:50,243 --> 00:14:52,066
Suction. Clamp.

280
00:14:54,835 --> 00:14:57,221
- He's 007.
- 007, yep.

281
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,752
- A total 007.
- What's "007" mean?

282
00:14:59,853 --> 00:15:01,031
License to kill.

283
00:15:11,173 --> 00:15:14,339
007. They're calling me "007," aren't they?

284
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,284
- No one's calling you 007.
- No one's calling you 007.

285
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,608
On the elevator, murphy whispered, "007."

286
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,188
How many times do we have to go
through this, George? 5, 10?

287
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:22,643
Give me a number, or else I'm gonna hit you.

288
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:24,828
Murphy whispered, "007," and everyone laughed.

289
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,226
He wasn't talking about you.

290
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,184
Are you sure?

291
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,387
Would we lie to you?

292
00:15:28,724 --> 00:15:29,555
Yes.

293
00:15:29,673 --> 00:15:31,378
007 is a state of mind.

294
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:34,343
Says the girl who finished first
in her class at Stanford.

295
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:41,095
Oh, man. It's 911 for Katie Bryce.

296
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,665
I got to go.

297
00:15:50,478 --> 00:15:52,518
Maybe I should have gone into geriatrics.

298
00:15:52,861 --> 00:15:55,068
No one minds when you kill an old person.

299
00:15:55,171 --> 00:16:00,250
Surgery is hot. It's the marines. It's macho.
It's hostile. It's hard-core.

300
00:16:00,644 --> 00:16:04,540
Geriatrics is for freaks who live with
their mothers and never have sex.

301
00:16:07,094 --> 00:16:09,179
I've got to get my own place.

302
00:16:16,117 --> 00:16:17,417
Excuse me! Excuse me!

303
00:16:20,468 --> 00:16:21,907
Took you long enough.

304
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:23,864
You're okay? The nurse paged me "911."

305
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:27,052
I had to go all "exorcist" to get
her to even pick up the phone.

306
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:30,160
Wait.

307
00:16:30,396 --> 00:16:31,678
There's nothing wrong with you?

308
00:16:31,748 --> 00:16:32,603
I'm bored.

309
00:16:34,687 --> 00:16:35,783
You little...

310
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:39,326
- I'm not a cruise director.
- You don't have to wig out.

311
00:16:39,655 --> 00:16:43,478
The pageant's supposed to be on cable, but
this crappy hospital doesn't get the channel.

312
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,334
If that cow kylie wood is gonna walk
off with my crown, I have to see it.

313
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:48,737
Can you call someone?

314
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:54,031
Okay, this is an actual hospital.

315
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:55,880
There are sick people here.

316
00:16:56,054 --> 00:16:58,689
Go to sleep, and stop wasting my time.

317
00:16:58,782 --> 00:17:01,332
But I can't sleep. My head's all full.

318
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:02,770
That's called "thinking."

319
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:03,809
Go with it.

320
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:18,269
What do you need?

321
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,355
Mr. Jones has junky veins, and
he really needs antibiotics.

322
00:17:22,406 --> 00:17:24,069
I should start a central line.

323
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,192
So start one.

324
00:17:26,236 --> 00:17:27,408
You don't know how.

325
00:17:27,935 --> 00:17:29,010
I've never done one.

326
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,108
Well, you know what that means.

327
00:17:34,217 --> 00:17:35,907
Can't we just page someone else?

328
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:37,331
She's the on-call resident.

329
00:17:38,744 --> 00:17:39,573
Okay.

330
00:17:40,547 --> 00:17:42,078
Okay, I'll just - I'll wake her.

331
00:17:49,232 --> 00:17:51,805
- Dr. Bailey, I don't mean to bother you.
- Then don't.

332
00:17:51,892 --> 00:17:54,192
- It's Mr. Jones.
- Is he dying?

333
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:54,991
No.

334
00:17:55,092 --> 00:17:56,864
Then stop talking to me.

335
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,095
What is it?!

336
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:17,697
Next time you wake me, he better be so
close to dead, there's a tag on his toe.

337
00:18:26,913 --> 00:18:28,741
Here. Take these to the lab.

338
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,565
4-b's got post-op pneumonia.

339
00:18:36,642 --> 00:18:37,635
Let's start antibiotics.

340
00:18:37,737 --> 00:18:40,099
Are you sure that's the right diagnosis?

341
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,941
Well, I don't know. I'm only an intern.

342
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:46,693
Why don't you go spend 4 years in med school and
then let me know if it's the right diagnosis?

343
00:18:47,205 --> 00:18:49,938
She's short of breath. She's got fever.
She's post-op.

344
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:51,382
Start the antibiotics.

345
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,450
God, I hate nurses.

346
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,525
I'm Alex.

347
00:18:59,154 --> 00:19:01,576
I'm with Jeremy. You're with the Nazi, right?

348
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:05,320
She may not have pneumonia, you know?
She could be splinting, or have a P.E.

349
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:07,275
Like I said, I hate nurses.

350
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:09,593
What did you just say?

351
00:19:11,053 --> 00:19:12,768
Did you just call me a nurse?

352
00:19:12,897 --> 00:19:14,422
Well, if the white cap fits.

353
00:19:17,844 --> 00:19:19,072
Damn it, Katie.

354
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:21,897
Is she seeing anybody?

355
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:22,988
I don't know.

356
00:19:23,408 --> 00:19:24,304
She's hot.

357
00:19:24,514 --> 00:19:25,517
I'm friends with her.

358
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:29,553
I mean kind of friends - not
actually friends, exactly,

359
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:33,505
but we're tight, and we hang
out - really, only just today.

360
00:19:33,582 --> 00:19:35,666
- Dude.
- Dude, stop talking.

361
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:51,388
What took you so long?

362
00:19:52,296 --> 00:19:54,883
She's having multiple grand mal seizures.

363
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,109
Now, how do you want to proceed?

364
00:19:57,421 --> 00:19:59,648
Dr. Grey, are you listening to me?!

365
00:20:00,544 --> 00:20:04,686
She's got diazepam - 2 milligrams lorazepam
- I just gave the second dose.

366
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:07,590
Dr. Grey, you need to tell
us what you want to do.

367
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:09,484
Dr. Grey!

368
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,254
- Okay, she's full on lorazepam?
- She's had 4 milligrams.

369
00:20:18,377 --> 00:20:20,214
You paged Dr. Bailey and Dr. Shepherd?

370
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,448
Lorazepam's not working.

371
00:20:21,673 --> 00:20:23,696
Phenobarbital - load her with phenobarbital.

372
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,035
Pheno's in.

373
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:28,085
No change.

374
00:20:28,304 --> 00:20:30,224
- You paged Dr. Shepherd?
- I just told you.

375
00:20:31,371 --> 00:20:33,194
Well, page him again, stat.

376
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:34,198
What do you want to do?

377
00:20:34,632 --> 00:20:37,029
Dr. Grey, you need to tell
us what you want to do.

378
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:40,449
- Heart stopped.
- Code blue! Code blue!

379
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:43,281
Code blue! Code blue!

380
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:49,814
Wait.

381
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:52,804
Charge the pads to 200.

382
00:20:52,873 --> 00:20:53,608
Charge.

383
00:20:53,822 --> 00:20:54,586
Clear.

384
00:20:57,283 --> 00:20:58,662
Still v-fib. Nothing.

385
00:20:58,755 --> 00:20:59,378
Charging.

386
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:00,417
19 seconds.

387
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,538
Charge them to 300.

388
00:21:02,073 --> 00:21:03,781
300. Anything?

389
00:21:03,858 --> 00:21:04,738
27 seconds.

390
00:21:05,158 --> 00:21:06,320
Charge to 360.

391
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,834
Come on, Katie.

392
00:21:08,937 --> 00:21:09,981
49 seconds.

393
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:12,198
At 60 seconds, you're supposed
to admin her another drug.

394
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:12,870
Charge again!

395
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,608
Charge again.

396
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:21,639
Anything?

397
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:22,962
I see sinus rhythm.

398
00:21:23,752 --> 00:21:24,947
Blood pressure's coming up.

399
00:21:25,098 --> 00:21:25,848
All right.

400
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:27,885
Pressure's returning.

401
00:21:28,137 --> 00:21:29,084
Rate's coming back.

402
00:21:29,781 --> 00:21:30,821
What the hell happened?

403
00:21:31,137 --> 00:21:33,032
She had a seizure, and her heart stopped.

404
00:21:33,144 --> 00:21:34,557
You were supposed to be monitoring her.

405
00:21:34,778 --> 00:21:37,178
- I checked on her -
- I got her. Just - just go.

406
00:21:40,902 --> 00:21:41,880
Somebody give me her -

407
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,060
give me her chart, please.

408
00:21:44,357 --> 00:21:46,857
You get a 911, you page me immediately,

409
00:21:46,923 --> 00:21:49,769
not in the 5 minutes it takes you to
get to the emergency, immediately.

410
00:21:49,846 --> 00:21:53,247
You're on my team, and if
somebody dies, it's my ass.

411
00:21:55,463 --> 00:21:56,256
Meredith?

412
00:22:19,112 --> 00:22:20,674
You tell anyone, ever...

413
00:22:31,873 --> 00:22:34,375
You said it was a seizure disorder.

414
00:22:34,503 --> 00:22:35,532
Now you're saying it isn't?

415
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,078
I'm saying that I don't know.

416
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:38,405
What do you think it could be?

417
00:22:38,544 --> 00:22:39,295
I don't know.

418
00:22:39,388 --> 00:22:40,298
When will you know?

419
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,701
I don't have an answer for you.

420
00:22:41,774 --> 00:22:45,930
- For now, Katie is stable, and -
- Wait one damn minute.

421
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:50,453
We came here because this hospital is
supposed to be the best in Washington.

422
00:22:51,142 --> 00:22:53,989
That's my kid in there - my kid -

423
00:22:54,231 --> 00:22:56,862
and you have the audacity to stand
here and tell me, "I don't know."

424
00:22:56,933 --> 00:22:57,512
Mr. Bryce -

425
00:22:57,593 --> 00:23:01,112
No, I want someone else, a doctor
who knows what they're doing.

426
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:03,651
You get me someone else,
someone better than you.

427
00:23:03,718 --> 00:23:05,792
Mr. Bryce, I assure you that I
am working hard on Katie's case.

428
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:09,047
No, you're not. If you were, you'd
be able to give me some answers.

429
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,786
I put you on the bypass machine,
which pumps blood for your heart.

430
00:23:13,036 --> 00:23:16,743
Fix your ticker, take you off the machine
- I'm done - simple procedure.

431
00:23:17,573 --> 00:23:19,589
So I shouldn't worry?

432
00:23:19,873 --> 00:23:21,509
I'm very good at what I do.

433
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:23,144
But still it's surgery.

434
00:23:23,214 --> 00:23:24,403
There are some risks.

435
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,762
I'll see you in the O.R.
this afternoon, Mr. Savitch.

436
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:32,313
You're not gonna leave me
alone with that guy, are you?

437
00:23:33,941 --> 00:23:36,139
Oh, I'll be outside the O.R. the whole time.

438
00:23:36,518 --> 00:23:38,845
No, Dr. Burke is very good.

439
00:23:39,306 --> 00:23:40,224
Don't worry.

440
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:41,781
I'll see you after.

441
00:23:42,113 --> 00:23:43,695
He'll be fine, right?

442
00:23:43,772 --> 00:23:45,108
Tony's gonna sail through it.

443
00:23:47,985 --> 00:23:50,628
You have nothing to worry about - I promise.

444
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,443
I gotta go.

445
00:23:54,421 --> 00:23:55,318
What are you doing?

446
00:23:55,564 --> 00:23:59,521
I'm suturing a banana with the vain
hope that it wakes up my brain.

447
00:24:00,499 --> 00:24:02,456
What are you smiling at, 007?

448
00:24:03,474 --> 00:24:05,461
I'm sorry. I get mean when I'm tired.

449
00:24:05,543 --> 00:24:06,311
You know what?

450
00:24:06,707 --> 00:24:07,954
I don't care.

451
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:12,834
I comforted a family, and I got to hang
out in the O.R. today. All is well.

452
00:24:12,905 --> 00:24:14,353
Does anybody know why we're here?

453
00:24:15,004 --> 00:24:15,972
Well, good morning.

454
00:24:18,012 --> 00:24:19,889
I'm gonna do something
pretty rare for a surgeon.

455
00:24:20,212 --> 00:24:21,942
I'm gonna ask interns for help.

456
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:24,283
I've got this kid, Katie Bryce.

457
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,462
Right now, she's a mystery.

458
00:24:27,353 --> 00:24:28,849
She doesn't respond to our meds.

459
00:24:29,028 --> 00:24:31,088
The labs are clean, the scans are pure,

460
00:24:31,332 --> 00:24:35,004
but she's having seizures - grand
mal seizures with no visible cause.

461
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,780
She's a ticking clock.

462
00:24:37,037 --> 00:24:40,630
She's gonna die if I don't make a
diagnosis, which is where you come in.

463
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,263
I can't do it alone.

464
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:45,168
I need your extra minds, extra eyes.

465
00:24:45,381 --> 00:24:48,747
I need you to play detective. I need you
to find out why Katie is having seizures.

466
00:24:49,431 --> 00:24:53,041
I know you're tired. You're busy. You got
more work than you can possibly handle.

467
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,236
I understand, so I'm gonna
give you an incentive.

468
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:59,037
Whoever finds the answer rides with me.

469
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:00,671
Katie needs surgery.

470
00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:05,734
You get to do what no interns get to do -
scrub in to assist on an advanced procedure.

471
00:25:06,245 --> 00:25:08,140
Dr. Bailey's gonna hand you Katie's chart.

472
00:25:08,212 --> 00:25:09,754
The clock is ticking fast, people.

473
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,883
If we're gonna save Katie's
life, we have to do it soon.

474
00:25:19,058 --> 00:25:20,058
Did you just page me?

475
00:25:20,183 --> 00:25:21,853
Yes.
4-B's still short of breath.

476
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,481
Look, give the antibiotics time to work.

477
00:25:24,568 --> 00:25:26,294
The antibiotics should have worked by now.

478
00:25:26,504 --> 00:25:28,301
She's old. She's freaking ancient.

479
00:25:28,431 --> 00:25:30,002
She's lucky she's still breathing.

480
00:25:30,692 --> 00:25:34,917
I got a shot to scrub in downstairs on a patient
that wasn't alive during the civil war.

481
00:25:34,987 --> 00:25:36,437
Don't page me again.

482
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,342
Hey, I want in on shepherd's surgery.

483
00:25:43,436 --> 00:25:45,022
You've been the intern on Katie since the start.

484
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,339
You want to work together?

485
00:25:46,456 --> 00:25:48,877
If we find the answer, we have a
50-50 chance of scrubbing in.

486
00:25:48,971 --> 00:25:52,129
I'll work with you, but I don't want
in on the surgery. You can have it.

487
00:25:52,221 --> 00:25:54,443
You're kidding? It's the biggest
opportunity any intern will ever get.

488
00:25:54,526 --> 00:25:56,630
I don't want to spend any more
time with Shepherd than I have to.

489
00:25:56,716 --> 00:25:57,808
What do you have against shepherd?

490
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,469
If we find the answer, the surgery's yours.
Do you want to work together or not?

491
00:26:02,139 --> 00:26:02,814
Deal.

492
00:26:02,891 --> 00:26:05,963
So she doesn't have anoxia, chronic
renal failure, or acidosis.

493
00:26:06,034 --> 00:26:08,446
It's not a tumor, because her C.T.'s clean.

494
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:11,433
Are you seriously not gonna tell me
why you won't work with Shepherd?

495
00:26:11,498 --> 00:26:12,147
No.

496
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,312
What about infection?

497
00:26:13,393 --> 00:26:16,941
No, there's no white count, and she has no C.T.
lesions, no fevers,

498
00:26:17,316 --> 00:26:19,763
nothing in her spinal tap. Just tell me.

499
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:24,730
You can't comment, make a
face, or react in any way.

500
00:26:26,716 --> 00:26:27,734
We had sex.

501
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:33,105
What about an aneurysm?

502
00:26:33,566 --> 00:26:35,630
No blood on the C.T. and no headaches.

503
00:26:35,701 --> 00:26:40,114
Okay, there's no drug use,
no pregnancy, no trauma.

504
00:26:42,454 --> 00:26:43,473
Was he good?

505
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,203
I mean, he looks like he'd be good.
Was it any good?

506
00:26:48,957 --> 00:26:50,012
We're out of answers.

507
00:26:52,176 --> 00:26:53,759
What if no one comes up with anything?

508
00:26:53,852 --> 00:26:55,050
You mean what if she dies?

509
00:26:55,136 --> 00:26:55,971
Yeah.

510
00:26:57,538 --> 00:27:01,143
This is gonna sound really bad,
but I really wanted that surgery.

511
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,459
She's just never gonna get the
chance to turn into a person.

512
00:27:05,592 --> 00:27:10,491
The sum total of her existence will
be almost winning miss teen whatever.

513
00:27:12,504 --> 00:27:14,394
You know what her pageant talent is?

514
00:27:14,474 --> 00:27:15,449
They have talent?

515
00:27:15,955 --> 00:27:17,670
Rhythmic gymnastics.

516
00:27:17,931 --> 00:27:19,800
Oh, come on.

517
00:27:20,362 --> 00:27:22,680
What is rhythmic gymnastics?
I can't even say it.

518
00:27:22,693 --> 00:27:25,022
I don't know what it is.

519
00:27:27,711 --> 00:27:30,665
I think it's something with a ball and a -

520
00:27:32,201 --> 00:27:32,948
What?

521
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,682
Meredith, what?

522
00:27:35,784 --> 00:27:37,132
Get up. Come on.

523
00:27:38,486 --> 00:27:41,141
The only thing that she
would possibly need is an angiogram.

524
00:27:41,361 --> 00:27:43,353
Oh. Oh, Dr. Shepherd, just one moment.

525
00:27:44,014 --> 00:27:46,116
Katie competes in beauty pageants.

526
00:27:46,205 --> 00:27:48,077
I know that, but we have
to save her life, anyway.

527
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,022
She has no headaches, no neck
pain, her C.T. is clean.

528
00:27:51,145 --> 00:27:54,073
- There's no medical proof of an aneurysm.
- Right.

529
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,848
- But what if she has an aneurysm, anyway?
- There are no indicators.

530
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:59,910
She twisted her ankle
practicing for the pageant.

531
00:28:00,018 --> 00:28:03,730
- I appreciate you trying to help, but -
- She fell when she twisted her ankle, she fell.

532
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,501
It was no big deal, not even
a bump on the head. She

533
00:28:06,514 --> 00:28:08,916
got up, iced her ankle,
and everything was fine.

534
00:28:08,993 --> 00:28:10,725
It was a fall so minor,
her doctor didn't even

535
00:28:10,738 --> 00:28:12,480
think to mention it when I
was taking her history,

536
00:28:12,562 --> 00:28:14,661
but she did fall.

537
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,112
You know what the chance is that a
minor fall could burst an aneurysm?

538
00:28:17,181 --> 00:28:18,650
One in a million - literally.

539
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,774
Let's go.

540
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:28,413
Where?

541
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:30,221
To find out if Katie's one in a million.

542
00:28:48,265 --> 00:28:49,313
I'll be damned.

543
00:28:50,277 --> 00:28:51,096
There it is.

544
00:28:53,655 --> 00:28:55,304
It's minute, but it's there.

545
00:28:56,728 --> 00:28:58,371
It's a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

546
00:28:59,676 --> 00:29:01,652
She's bleeding into her brain.

547
00:29:06,938 --> 00:29:09,947
She could have gone through her entire
life without it ever being a problem.

548
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:11,581
- One tap in the right spot...
- And it exploded.

549
00:29:11,643 --> 00:29:13,270
Exactly. Now I can fix it.

550
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,585
You two did great work.

551
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:18,857
Love to stay and kiss your asses, but I got
to tell Katie's parents she's having surgery.

552
00:29:18,943 --> 00:29:20,571
- Katie Bryce's chart, please.
- Here you go.

553
00:29:22,337 --> 00:29:26,577
Dr. Shepherd, you'd said that you'd
pick someone to scrub in if we helped?

554
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:29,598
Oh, yes, right. I'm sorry I can't take you both.

555
00:29:29,653 --> 00:29:30,914
It's gonna be a full house.

556
00:29:31,057 --> 00:29:32,536
Meredith, I'll see you in O.R.

557
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:41,584
Good. Thank you.

558
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:51,481
Cristina...

559
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,309
Wow, that was quick.

560
00:30:55,389 --> 00:30:57,915
His heart had too much
damage to give him a bypass.

561
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:00,230
I had to let him go.

562
00:31:01,305 --> 00:31:04,059
It happens - rarely, but it does happen -

563
00:31:04,248 --> 00:31:05,599
the worst part of the game.

564
00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:12,742
But I told his wife
- I told Gloria that he would be fine.

565
00:31:14,284 --> 00:31:16,265
- I promised her that -
- You what?

566
00:31:16,465 --> 00:31:19,752
- They have four little girls.
- This is my case.

567
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:21,446
Did you hear me promise?

568
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:24,185
The only one that can keep
a promise like that is

569
00:31:24,198 --> 00:31:26,025
god, and I haven't seen him
holding a scalpel lately.

570
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:29,276
You never promise a patient's
family a good outcome!

571
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,040
I thought...

572
00:31:32,234 --> 00:31:34,630
You're important enough to
make promises to Mrs. Savitch?

573
00:31:34,784 --> 00:31:37,207
You get to be the one to
tell her that she's a widow.

574
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,205
Izzie.

575
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,530
- Maybe Meredith couldn't -
- Izzie.

576
00:32:00,158 --> 00:32:04,593
- I'll tell him I changed my mind.
- Don't do me any favors. It's fine.

577
00:32:05,213 --> 00:32:07,983
- Cristina -
- You did a cutthroat thing. Deal with it.

578
00:32:08,069 --> 00:32:11,106
Don't come to me for absolution. You
want to be a shark, be a shark.

579
00:32:11,418 --> 00:32:13,486
- I'm not -
- Oh, yes, you are.

580
00:32:13,614 --> 00:32:16,497
Only it makes you feel all bad
in your warm, gooey places.

581
00:32:16,993 --> 00:32:18,018
No, screw you.

582
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,199
I don't get picked for surgeries
'cause I slept with my boss,

583
00:32:20,265 --> 00:32:22,396
and I didn't get into med school
'cause I have a famous mother.

584
00:32:22,462 --> 00:32:24,535
Some of us have to earn what we get.

585
00:32:37,193 --> 00:32:40,428
Gloria, there were complications in the surgery.

586
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:44,914
Tony's heart had a lot of damage.

587
00:32:45,627 --> 00:32:49,634
We tried to take him off bypass, but...

588
00:32:51,918 --> 00:32:53,874
there wasn't anything we could have done.

589
00:32:56,498 --> 00:32:58,206
What are you talking about?

590
00:32:59,449 --> 00:33:00,196
He...

591
00:33:02,635 --> 00:33:03,740
Tony died.

592
00:33:04,247 --> 00:33:05,173
He's dead.

593
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,980
Gloria...

594
00:33:08,942 --> 00:33:09,839
I am so sorry.

595
00:33:15,781 --> 00:33:16,697
Please...

596
00:33:19,085 --> 00:33:20,202
go away.

597
00:33:50,263 --> 00:33:51,764
I promised I'd make her look cool.

598
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:54,128
Apparently, being a bald
beauty queen is the worst

599
00:33:54,141 --> 00:33:56,114
thing that happened in the
history of the world.

600
00:33:58,358 --> 00:34:01,368
Did you choose me for the surgery
because I slept with you?

601
00:34:01,904 --> 00:34:02,708
Yes.

602
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:06,723
I'm kidding.

603
00:34:07,868 --> 00:34:09,677
I'm not gonna scrub in for surgery.

604
00:34:09,783 --> 00:34:11,638
You should ask Cristina. She really wants it.

605
00:34:11,724 --> 00:34:12,948
You're Katie's doctor.

606
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:16,855
And on your first day, with very little
training, you helped save her life.

607
00:34:16,947 --> 00:34:20,392
You earned the right to follow
her case through to the finish.

608
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:25,502
You shouldn't let the fact that we had sex
get in the way of you taking your shot.

609
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:41,486
I wish I wanted to be a chef

610
00:34:41,927 --> 00:34:45,046
or a ski instructor or a kindergarten teacher.

611
00:34:46,295 --> 00:34:48,987
You know, I would have been a
really good postal worker.

612
00:34:49,874 --> 00:34:51,169
I'm dependable.

613
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:57,002
You know, my parents tell everyone
they meet that their son's a surgeon,

614
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,151
as if it's a big accomplishment -

615
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,028
superhero or something.

616
00:35:04,466 --> 00:35:06,053
If they could see me now.

617
00:35:09,335 --> 00:35:12,008
When I told my mother I wanted
to go to medical school,

618
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,613
she tried to talk me out of it -

619
00:35:15,967 --> 00:35:18,439
said I didn't have what
it takes to be a surgeon,

620
00:35:19,181 --> 00:35:20,666
that I'd never make it.

621
00:35:21,782 --> 00:35:26,513
So the way I see it, superhero
sounds pretty damn good.

622
00:35:31,023 --> 00:35:32,826
We're gonna survive this, right?

623
00:35:40,214 --> 00:35:43,081
She's still short of breath. Did
you get an abg or a chest film?

624
00:35:43,169 --> 00:35:44,259
Oh, yes, sir, I did.

625
00:35:44,356 --> 00:35:45,468
And what did you see?

626
00:35:46,153 --> 00:35:48,687
Oh, well, I had a lot of patients last night.

627
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:50,898
Name the common causes of post-op fever.

628
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:54,279
- Uh, yes.
- From your head, not from a book.

629
00:35:54,371 --> 00:35:56,518
Don't look it up. Learn it.
It should be in your head.

630
00:35:56,531 --> 00:35:58,688
Name the common causes
of post-op fever.

631
00:35:58,785 --> 00:36:02,567
Uh... the common causes of post-

632
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:06,057
Can anybody name the common
causes of post-op fever?

633
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:13,177
Wind, Water, Wound, Walking,
Wonder drugs - the five W's -

634
00:36:13,387 --> 00:36:15,143
most of the time, it's Wind -

635
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,828
splinting or pneumonia.

636
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:22,111
Pneumonia's easy to assume, especially
if you're too busy to do the tests.

637
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,305
What do you think's wrong with 4-b?

638
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:31,103
The fourth "W," "Walking."

639
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,791
I think she's a prime candidate
for a pulmonary embolus.

640
00:36:33,897 --> 00:36:35,035
How would you diagnose?

641
00:36:37,323 --> 00:36:41,322
Spiral C.T., V/Q scan, provide O2,

642
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:45,085
dose with heparin, and
consult for an IVC filter.

643
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:51,147
Do exactly as she says, then tell your
resident that I want you off this case.

644
00:36:52,602 --> 00:36:55,602
I'd know you anywhere. You're the
spitting image of your mother.

645
00:36:56,509 --> 00:36:57,604
Welcome to the game.

646
00:37:15,745 --> 00:37:18,704
All right, everybody. It's a
beautiful night to save lives.

647
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,425
Let's have some fun.

648
00:37:30,154 --> 00:37:33,517
I can't think of any one reason
why I want to be a surgeon...

649
00:37:35,661 --> 00:37:38,600
but I can think of a thousand
reasons why I should quit.

650
00:37:53,509 --> 00:37:55,344
They make it hard on purpose.

651
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,753
There are lives in our hands.

652
00:38:11,258 --> 00:38:14,958
There comes a moment when
it's more than just a game...

653
00:38:26,228 --> 00:38:28,358
And you either take that step forward

654
00:38:29,536 --> 00:38:31,481
or turn around and walk away.

655
00:38:51,209 --> 00:38:52,268
I could quit,

656
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,055
but here's the thing...

657
00:38:57,563 --> 00:38:59,011
I love the playing field.

658
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:09,527
- It was good surgery.
- Yeah.

659
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:22,696
We don't have to do that thing where I say
something, and then you say something,

660
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:26,045
and then somebody cries, and there's a moment.

661
00:39:26,142 --> 00:39:26,930
Yuck.

662
00:39:27,663 --> 00:39:28,323
Good.

663
00:39:32,363 --> 00:39:33,679
You should get some sleep.

664
00:39:33,817 --> 00:39:34,887
You look like crap.

665
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:37,309
I look better than you.

666
00:39:37,805 --> 00:39:39,332
That's not possible.

667
00:39:56,929 --> 00:39:58,285
That was amazing.

668
00:40:03,196 --> 00:40:05,229
You practice on cadavers...

669
00:40:06,836 --> 00:40:07,989
you observe...

670
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:12,541
and you think you know what you're gonna
feel like, standing over that table, but...

671
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,622
that was such a high.

672
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:22,600
I don't know why anybody does drugs.

673
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:26,083
Yeah.

674
00:40:31,612 --> 00:40:32,503
Yeah.

675
00:40:36,081 --> 00:40:38,355
I should, uh, go do this.

676
00:40:40,552 --> 00:40:41,412
You should.

677
00:40:45,772 --> 00:40:46,819
I'll see you around.

678
00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:49,363
See you around.

679
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:51,330
See you.

680
00:40:56,645 --> 00:40:57,606
So...

681
00:40:58,144 --> 00:41:00,203
I made it through my first shift.

682
00:41:01,103 --> 00:41:02,184
We all did.

683
00:41:04,043 --> 00:41:07,017
The other interns are all good people.
You'd like them...

684
00:41:08,293 --> 00:41:09,213
I think.

685
00:41:10,965 --> 00:41:12,877
I don't know - maybe.

686
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,358
I like them.

687
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:23,166
Oh, and I changed my mind.

688
00:41:23,386 --> 00:41:24,969
I'm not gonna sell the house.

689
00:41:25,686 --> 00:41:26,761
I'm gonna keep it.

690
00:41:28,649 --> 00:41:30,877
I'll have to get a couple of roommates, but...

691
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:33,103
it's home, you know?

692
00:41:36,979 --> 00:41:38,377
Are you the doctor?

693
00:41:39,207 --> 00:41:39,924
No.

694
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:42,705
I'm not your doctor,

695
00:41:43,391 --> 00:41:44,794
but I am a doctor.

696
00:41:51,577 --> 00:41:52,632
What's your name?

697
00:41:55,674 --> 00:41:57,813
It's me, mom - Meredith.

698
00:42:01,295 --> 00:42:02,237
All right.

699
00:42:09,098 --> 00:42:11,033
I used to be a doctor, I think.

700
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:23,869
You were a doctor, mom.

701
00:42:24,407 --> 00:42:25,589
You were a surgeon.
