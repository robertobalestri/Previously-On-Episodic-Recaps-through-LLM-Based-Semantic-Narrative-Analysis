Meredith Grey narrates about "the game" of surgery, reflecting on whether she has what it takes, especially given her mother’s reputation as a great surgeon. Meredith wakes up after a one-night stand with a man named Derek, feeling embarrassed and urging him to leave because she is late for her first day of work. Derek tries to continue their flirtation, but Meredith insists he go. They awkwardly exchange names before Meredith heads off to her first day as a surgical intern at Seattle Grace Hospital.

At the hospital, Meredith and the other new interns, including Cristina Yang, George O'Malley, and Izzie Stevens, gather for orientation. Meredith gives an internal monologue about the challenges ahead, noting that only a few will make it through the grueling residency. The Chief of Surgery, Dr. Richard Webber, calls out names, and the interns discuss their assignments. Cristina notes the low number of women among the interns, and George mentions that one of the interns is rumored to be a model.

The interns are assigned to Dr. Miranda Bailey, known as "the Nazi" for her tough reputation. Bailey lays out her five rules: don’t suck up, answer every page at a run, don’t wake her unless a patient is dying, don’t let a dying patient be dead when she arrives, and always move when she moves. The interns are immediately thrown into action when a patient, Katie Bryce, a 15-year-old girl with seizures, is brought in. Bailey assigns tasks: Cristina on labs, George on patient workups, Meredith to take Katie for a CT, and Izzie to perform rectal exams.

The interns struggle with their new responsibilities. Meredith and Cristina discuss Katie’s case, noting that her labs are clear and there’s no obvious cause for her seizures. George hopes to be chosen for a surgical procedure, as it’s rumored the best intern gets to perform one on the first shift. Katie, frustrated about missing her beauty pageant, is sarcastic with the interns. Izzie, overwhelmed by rectal exams, laments that Bailey hates her.

The interns gossip about Meredith’s mother, Ellis Grey, a legendary surgeon. Cristina envies Meredith’s pedigree, while Izzie admires Ellis’s accomplishments. Alex Karev, another intern, joins the group, making crude jokes and antagonizing Izzie by calling her a nurse.

Bailey announces that George has been chosen to scrub in for an appendectomy, surprising everyone. Cristina and Alex doubt George’s abilities and bet on his failure. In the OR, George initially performs well but panics and makes a mistake, causing complications. Dr. Burke, the attending surgeon, takes over, and George is humiliated. The other interns nickname him "007," meaning "license to kill," referencing his near-fatal mistake.

Katie’s condition worsens, and the interns scramble to manage her seizures. Meredith and Cristina work together to try to diagnose her, reviewing her history and ruling out various causes. Meredith reveals to Cristina that she slept with Dr. Shepherd, who turns out to be Derek, the attending neurosurgeon. Cristina is more interested in the case than Meredith’s personal life.

Derek gathers the interns, asking for their help in diagnosing Katie, promising that whoever finds the answer will assist in her surgery. Meredith and Cristina collaborate, eventually realizing that Katie’s seizures may be due to a subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a minor fall during a rhythmic gymnastics rehearsal. They present their findings to Derek, who confirms the diagnosis and prepares for surgery. Derek chooses Meredith to scrub in, explaining that she earned it by helping save Katie’s life, not because of their personal history.

Meanwhile, George is devastated after promising a patient’s family that their loved one would be fine, only for the patient to die during surgery. Bailey reprimands George, telling him never to promise a good outcome. Izzie and Cristina argue about the cutthroat nature of the program, with Cristina accusing Izzie of not earning her opportunities.

Meredith decides not to sell her mother’s house and plans to get roommates. She visits her mother, Ellis Grey, who is suffering from memory loss and does not recognize Meredith as her daughter. Meredith gently reminds her mother that she was a surgeon.

The episode ends with Meredith reflecting on the challenges of being a surgeon, the pressure, and the reasons to quit, but ultimately admitting that she loves the work. Derek, Cristina, Izzie, Alex, and George all struggle with the demands of their first shift, but they survive. Meredith and Derek share a brief, professional exchange, agreeing not to make things awkward. Meredith concludes that, despite everything, she is staying in the game.
