The episode opens with Meredith Grey, the main character and narrator, reflecting on “the game” of surgery and her legacy as the daughter of the renowned surgeon Ellis Grey. Meredith feels overwhelmed and unprepared as she begins her first day as a surgical intern.

Meredith wakes up after a one-night stand with Derek Shepherd, whom she met at a bar the previous night. Embarrassed and in a rush, Meredith insists Derek leave before she starts her first shift at Seattle Grace Hospital. They exchange names and awkward goodbyes, agreeing not to pretend to care or exchange personal details.

At the hospital, Dr. Richard Webber welcomes the new interns, warning them about the competitive and grueling nature of surgical residency. Meredith, Cristina Yang, Izzie Stevens, and George O'Malley are introduced as interns assigned to Dr. Miranda Bailey, known as “the Nazi” for her tough reputation. Cristina and Izzie express surprise that Bailey is a woman, and George nervously tries to make friends.

Dr. Bailey lays out her five strict rules for the interns: don’t suck up, answer every page at a run, don’t wake her unless a patient is dying, don’t let the patient be dead when she arrives, and always move when she moves. The interns are immediately put to work on their first case: Katie Bryce, a 15-year-old girl with unexplained seizures. Meredith is assigned responsibility for Katie and takes her for a CT scan.

Cristina, Izzie, and George discuss the challenges of being interns and the pressure of living up to expectations, especially for Meredith, whose mother is a legendary surgeon. They speculate about Dr. Bailey’s reputation and tease George about his nervousness.

George is selected by Dr. Bailey to perform the first surgery of the intern class, an appendectomy, despite Cristina’s skepticism about his abilities. The other interns place bets on whether George will succeed or fail. During the surgery, George initially performs well but makes a mistake, causing complications. Dr. Burke steps in to take over, and George earns the nickname “007” for his “license to kill” after the incident.

Meanwhile, Katie Bryce’s condition worsens. Meredith and Cristina work together to solve the mystery of her seizures, agreeing to split the reward of scrubbing in on the surgery if they find the answer. Meredith confides in Cristina that she slept with Dr. Shepherd, which complicates her feelings about working with him.

The interns struggle with other cases, including diagnosing a post-op patient with pneumonia, which Cristina correctly identifies as a pulmonary embolus after reviewing the five common causes of post-op fever. Meredith and Cristina continue to investigate Katie’s case, eventually realizing that a minor fall during rhythmic gymnastics practice may have caused a rare subarachnoid hemorrhage. They present their findings to Dr. Shepherd, who confirms the diagnosis and prepares for surgery.

Dr. Shepherd praises Meredith and Cristina for their detective work and invites Meredith to scrub in on Katie’s surgery, insisting she earned the opportunity through her efforts, not because of their personal history. Meredith initially hesitates but ultimately participates in the surgery, experiencing the exhilaration of being in the operating room.

Elsewhere, Dr. Burke performs heart surgery on Mr. Savage, but complications arise, and the patient dies. George is tasked with delivering the bad news to the patient’s wife, Gloria, and struggles with the emotional weight of the responsibility. Dr. Shepherd admonishes George for making promises to patients’ families, reminding him that only God can guarantee outcomes.

The interns reflect on their first day, sharing their doubts and hopes. Meredith decides not to sell her mother’s house and plans to find roommates, making it her home. She visits her mother, Ellis Grey, who is suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, and introduces herself as Meredith, acknowledging her mother’s legacy as a surgeon.

The episode ends with Meredith’s voiceover contemplating the challenges of being a surgeon, the reasons to quit, and the reasons to stay. Despite the difficulties, she realizes she loves the playing field and is determined to continue.
