Meredith Grey opens the episode reflecting on "the game" of surgery, noting that some people have what it takes and some do not. She mentions her mother was a great surgeon, but she feels unprepared. The episode begins with Meredith waking up after a one-night stand with Derek Shepherd. She is embarrassed and urges Derek to leave because she is late for her first day of work. As they awkwardly discuss her living situation, Meredith reveals she just moved from Boston and is selling her mother's house. Derek tries to be friendly, but Meredith insists on keeping things impersonal, telling him goodbye.

At the hospital, Meredith joins a group of new surgical interns. Dr. Richard Webber addresses them, warning that many will not make it through the program. Dr. Miranda Bailey, known as "The Nazi," introduces herself to the interns and lays out her five strict rules: don’t suck up, answer every page at a run, don’t wake her unless a patient is dying, don’t let the patient be dead when she arrives, and always move when she moves.

The interns are assigned to Dr. Bailey. Meredith, Cristina Yang, George O'Malley, and Izzie Stevens meet and discuss their assignments. George nervously tries to make friends, while Cristina is focused and competitive. Izzie is introduced as a former model, which draws some skepticism from the others.

Their first patient is Katie Bryce, a 15-year-old pageant contestant with unexplained seizures. Dr. Bailey assigns tasks: Cristina runs labs, George does patient workups, and Meredith is responsible for Katie, including taking her for a CT scan. Izzie is assigned to perform rectal exams.

Meredith struggles to connect with Katie, who is upset about missing her pageant. Meredith tries to perform her duties despite Katie’s complaints and her own exhaustion. Meanwhile, the interns bond and gossip about Meredith’s famous mother, Ellis Grey, a legendary surgeon. Cristina expresses envy, while George is oblivious to Ellis’s reputation.

Dr. Bailey announces that George has been chosen to perform the first surgery, an appendectomy, as a test of his abilities. The other interns place bets on whether he will succeed or fail. In the operating room, George initially performs well but panics when a complication arises. Dr. Burke takes over, and George is humiliated, earning the nickname "007" (license to kill) from his peers.

Katie’s condition worsens, and she suffers a cardiac arrest. Meredith and the team struggle to revive her, eventually succeeding after several attempts. Dr. Shepherd and Dr. Burke criticize the interns for not paging them sooner. Katie’s parents are distraught and demand answers, but Dr. Shepherd admits he does not yet know the cause of her seizures.

Elsewhere, Dr. Burke performs heart surgery on another patient, Tony Savage, but the patient dies due to extensive heart damage. Cristina and George are upset, especially after having reassured the family. Dr. Bailey reminds them never to promise a good outcome to patients’ families.

Dr. Shepherd gathers the interns and asks for their help diagnosing Katie, offering the incentive that whoever finds the answer can scrub in on her surgery. Meredith and Cristina team up to solve the case. Meredith confides in Cristina that she slept with Dr. Shepherd, which is why she does not want to work with him. They review Katie’s history and realize that a minor fall during a pageant rehearsal could have caused a rare brain aneurysm. They present their findings to Dr. Shepherd, who confirms a subarachnoid hemorrhage and prepares for surgery.

Dr. Shepherd chooses Meredith to assist in the surgery, explaining that she earned the right by helping save Katie’s life. Meredith is initially reluctant due to their personal history but ultimately participates. Cristina is disappointed but accepts Meredith’s decision.

After the surgery, the interns reflect on their experiences. George laments his failures, while Cristina recalls her mother doubting her abilities. Meredith decides to keep her mother’s house and considers getting roommates. She visits her mother, Ellis Grey, who is now suffering from memory loss and does not recognize Meredith. Meredith gently reminds her mother of her past as a surgeon.

The episode ends with Meredith reflecting on the challenges of being a surgeon, the pressures of the job, and her love for the work despite its difficulties. The interns, though exhausted, have survived their first shift and begin to form bonds as they face the challenges ahead.
