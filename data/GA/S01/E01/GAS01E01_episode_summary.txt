**Episode Summary:**

The episode introduces Meredith Grey, a new surgical intern at Seattle Grace Hospital, who narrates about the pressures of "the game" of surgery, feeling overshadowed by her renowned surgeon mother, Ellis Grey. After a one-night stand with Derek, whom she believes to be a stranger, Meredith awkwardly dismisses him from her late mother's house before heading to her first day as an intern. At the hospital, Meredith joins fellow interns Cristina Yang, George O'Malley, Izzie Stevens, and Alex Karev. They are warned by their strict resident, Dr. Miranda Bailey ("the Nazi"), about the grueling nature of their training.

The interns are quickly immersed in hospital life: George is unexpectedly chosen to assist Dr. Burke in surgery but falters under pressure, earning the humiliating nickname "007." Izzie is relegated to performing rectal exams, while Cristina and Meredith bond over their ambition and frustration. Meredith is assigned to a complex case: Katie Bryce, a teenage pageant contestant with unexplained seizures. Meredith and Cristina collaborate to diagnose Katie, eventually deducing she has a subarachnoid hemorrhage from a gymnastics injury, impressing Dr. Shepherd—the new attending neurosurgeon, who is revealed to be Meredith's one-night stand, Derek.

Professional and personal tensions arise: Meredith and Derek agree to keep their past private, while Cristina is disappointed when Meredith is chosen to assist in Katie's surgery. Cristina accuses Meredith of benefiting from her mother's reputation and her connection to Shepherd, but Meredith offers the surgery to Cristina, who refuses, insisting Meredith face the consequences of her actions. Meanwhile, Izzie struggles emotionally after a patient dies, having promised the patient's wife he would survive, and is chastised by Dr. Burke for overstepping.

Throughout the episode, the interns grapple with self-doubt, the weight of expectations, and the realities of surgical life. Meredith ultimately decides not to sell her mother's house, opting instead to make it her home with roommates. The episode closes with Meredith visiting her mother, who is revealed to have Alzheimer's and does not recognize her. Meredith affirms her own identity as a doctor, signaling her resolve to step out of her mother's shadow.
