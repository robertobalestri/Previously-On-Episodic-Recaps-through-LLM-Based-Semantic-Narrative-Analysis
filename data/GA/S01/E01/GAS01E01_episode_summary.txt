The story began with a character reflecting on the nature of "the game," explaining that some people are suited to play while others are not. The narrator revealed that her mother was one of the greats in the field, but she herself felt unprepared for what lay ahead. In a house, two people awoke after what appeared to be a one-night stand. One of them, embarrassed and anxious about being late for her first day of work, insisted the other leave. During their awkward exchange, they introduced themselves as Derek and Meredith. Meredith explained that she had recently moved from Boston, was staying in her mother's house, and planned to sell it. After this uncomfortable conversation, Derek left.

Later, Meredith joined a group of new surgical interns at a hospital. An unidentified speaker addressed them, warning of the intense challenges of surgical residency and the fierce competition among them. In a hospital hallway, several interns—Cristina, George O'Malley, Meredith, and Izzie Stevens—discussed their assignments and speculated about a resident known as "the Nazi." Izzie clarified that her nickname was "Izzie." Soon after, the resident, Dr. Bailey, introduced herself to the group, laying out five strict rules for their conduct and emphasizing her authority. She instructed them to follow her and warned them not to wake her unless a patient was dying.

In the emergency room, Dr. Bailey, Dr. Burke, and the interns received a patient named Katie Bryce, a 15-year-old girl suffering from seizures. Dr. Bailey assigned Cristina to labs, George to patient work-ups, Meredith to take Katie for a CT scan, and Izzie to perform rectal exams. Cristina reported to Dr. Bailey that Katie's labs were clear and inquired about a rumored opportunity for the best intern to perform a procedure, but Dr. Bailey dismissed her.

Elsewhere, a patient joked about not being able to eat bacon after surgery, and an intern reassured him. Meredith checked on Katie, who was upset about missing a beauty pageant. Meanwhile, George awkwardly prepared to perform a rectal exam on a patient.

In the hospital cafeteria, George, Cristina, and Izzie discussed their difficult first shift and gossiped about Meredith's mother, Ellis Grey, and her reputation. When Meredith arrived, the group talked about their cases. An attending announced that George O'Malley had been chosen to perform an appendectomy, surprising everyone. Two doctors discussed George's selection, with one expressing skepticism about his abilities.

Katie Bryce's parents asked an intern about her condition, but the intern deferred to Dr. Shepherd, who had taken over Katie's case. Meredith approached Dr. Shepherd, who was revealed to be Derek from the earlier encounter. They awkwardly discussed their previous night together and agreed to keep things professional, with Meredith insisting their personal relationship could not continue.

In an observation area, several interns watched as George prepared for his appendectomy, placing bets on his performance. In the operating room, George began the surgery under Dr. Burke's supervision. He successfully removed the appendix but then made a mistake, causing a complication. Dr. Burke took over, and George was removed from the surgery. The other interns nicknamed him "007," implying he had a "license to kill." George was upset by the nickname, and although Cristina and Izzie tried to reassure him, he remained insecure.

Suddenly, an emergency arose with Katie Bryce, and Meredith rushed to respond. She found Katie having another seizure. Nurses and staff urged Meredith to make decisions, but she hesitated. The team worked to treat Katie, but her heart stopped. They performed resuscitation and eventually restored her heartbeat. Dr. Bailey scolded Meredith for not paging her immediately.

Dr. Shepherd and Dr. Bailey discussed Katie's unclear diagnosis with her parents. Katie's father became angry at the lack of answers and demanded another doctor. Elsewhere, Dr. Burke discussed an upcoming bypass surgery with a patient named Mr. Savitch and his wife, Gloria. An intern reassured Gloria that her husband would be fine, despite the risks.

Cristina practiced suturing on a banana and discussed the day's difficulties with George. Dr. Shepherd gathered the interns and asked for their help in diagnosing Katie Bryce, offering the chance to assist in surgery as a reward. Dr. Bailey distributed Katie's chart to the interns.

Izzie paged Alex Karev about a patient, 4-B, who was still short of breath. Alex dismissed her concerns, preferring to focus on a more exciting case, and made a sexist remark by mistaking Izzie for a nurse. Izzie confronted him about it.

Cristina and Meredith agreed to work together to solve Katie's case, with Meredith declining the chance to assist in surgery if they succeeded. Cristina pressed Meredith about her reluctance to work with Dr. Shepherd, and Meredith confessed that she had slept with him. They continued to brainstorm possible diagnoses for Katie.

Cristina and Meredith realized that Katie's minor fall during rhythmic gymnastics practice could have caused a rare aneurysm. They presented their theory to Dr. Shepherd, who ordered an angiogram. The test revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage, confirming their diagnosis. Dr. Shepherd praised both Meredith and Cristina for their work but selected Meredith to scrub in for Katie's surgery, leaving Cristina disappointed.

Dr. Burke informed an intern that Mr. Savitch's heart was too damaged for bypass surgery and that he had died. The intern was distraught, having promised Gloria Savitch that her husband would be fine. Dr. Burke admonished the intern for making promises to patients' families.

Cristina confronted Meredith about being chosen for the surgery, accusing her of benefiting from her relationship with Dr. Shepherd and her famous mother. Meredith tried to apologize, but Cristina rebuffed her. An intern informed Gloria Savitch that her husband, Tony, had died during surgery. Gloria was devastated and asked the intern to leave.

Izzie prepared Katie Bryce for surgery, trying to comfort her about losing her hair. Meredith asked Dr. Shepherd if she had been chosen for the surgery because of their personal relationship. He joked, then assured her she had earned the opportunity.

George and another intern reflected on their career choices and the pressures of being a surgeon. George revealed his parents were proud of him, while the other intern shared that her mother doubted her abilities.

Dr. Burke quizzed Izzie about a patient with post-op fever. Izzie correctly identified the five W's of post-op fever and suggested a pulmonary embolus as the diagnosis. Dr. Burke instructed her to follow up and noted her resemblance to her mother, welcoming her to the profession.

Dr. Shepherd prepared for Katie Bryce's surgery, telling the team it was a beautiful night to save lives. Meredith narrated about the challenges and responsibilities of being a surgeon. After the surgery, Meredith and Cristina had a brief, non-emotional exchange, agreeing not to have a dramatic moment. They joked about each other's appearance and suggested getting some sleep.

George and another intern expressed excitement after participating in surgery, describing the experience as exhilarating and better than drugs. They parted ways, satisfied with their work.

Meredith narrated about surviving the first shift. She decided not to sell her mother's house and planned to get roommates. She visited her mother, who was in a care facility and did not recognize her. Meredith reminded her mother that she had been a surgeon.
