A speaker reflected on the unforgiving nature of “the game,” explaining that some people are born to play while others are not. The speaker's mother, Ellis Grey, had been one of the greats, but the speaker, Meredith Grey, felt she could never measure up. Early one morning, Meredith woke up next to a man she barely knew and, embarrassed, told him he needed to leave because she was late for her first day of work. As they dressed, Meredith and the man introduced themselves—he was Derek Shepherd, and she was Meredith Grey. Meredith explained she had just moved from Boston and was in the process of selling her mother's house. Before heading to the shower, Meredith told Derek to be gone by the time she returned, and they said their goodbyes.

At Seattle Grace Hospital, a group of new surgical interns gathered for orientation. Dr. Richard Webber, the Chief of Surgery, addressed them, reminding them that they were now doctors, not students, and warning them about the grueling challenges ahead, including a high attrition rate. Dr. Webber urged them to look at their peers as competition and emphasized that their success depended on how well they played the game. Meredith, feeling overwhelmed, internally repeated that she was “screwed.”

The interns, including Meredith Grey, Cristina Yang, George O'Malley, and others, gathered and discussed the gender ratio among them and rumors that one intern had been a model. Cristina and George realized they were all assigned to the same resident, Miranda Bailey, who was notoriously nicknamed “the Nazi.” George awkwardly introduced himself to Cristina, recalling their brief meeting at a mixer. When Dr. Bailey arrived, she laid out five strict rules for her interns: always run to pages, never wake her unless a patient was dying, and always follow her lead, among others. She assigned tasks—Cristina to labs, George to patient work-ups, and Meredith to take responsibility for a patient named Katie Bryce, a 15-year-old girl who had been brought in with seizures. Another intern was assigned to perform rectal exams on all the male patients.

The team worked quickly to stabilize Katie Bryce, administering medication and ordering tests. Dr. Preston Burke instructed Dr. Bailey to run every possible test. Cristina reported that Katie's labs were clear, leaving her seizures unexplained. Cristina mentioned a rumor that the best intern would get to perform a procedure on the first shift, fueling competition among the group. Meredith tried to comfort Katie, who was upset about missing a pageant due to her hospitalization. Meanwhile, another intern struggled with the unpleasant task of performing rectal exams.

Later, the interns gathered to commiserate about their difficult shift and the harsh treatment from their superiors. They gossiped about Meredith's famous mother, Ellis Grey, and the pressure Meredith must feel to live up to her legacy. Cristina complained about Katie Bryce being a challenging patient. Dr. Burke then surprised everyone by announcing that George O'Malley had been chosen to perform the first surgery, an appendectomy. George was shocked but congratulated by his peers. Senior doctors discussed George's selection with skepticism.

When Katie's parents asked about her condition, Meredith deferred to the new attending, Dr. Shepherd. To her shock, Meredith realized Dr. Shepherd was Derek, the man she had spent the night with. They awkwardly agreed to keep their previous encounter professional.

The interns watched as George prepared for surgery, betting on whether he would succeed or fail. Under Dr. Burke's supervision, George began the appendectomy and successfully removed the appendix, but then he accidentally tore the cecum, causing complications. Dr. Burke took over and berated George, calling him a “pansy-ass idiot.” The other interns nicknamed George “007,” meaning “license to kill.” When George realized he was being called “007,” he confronted the others, who denied it.

Cristina received a 911 page for Katie Bryce and rushed off. George, discouraged by his failure in surgery, considered switching specialties. Meanwhile, Meredith was paged for Katie, but discovered that Katie was simply bored and wanted to watch her pageant on TV. Frustrated, Meredith returned to her duties. Cristina and another intern debated whether to wake Dr. Bailey to help with a central line for a patient. When they woke her, Dr. Bailey was furious and reminded them not to disturb her unless a patient was near death. Cristina was then given lab samples to deliver.

Cristina interacted with a nurse about a post-op patient with pneumonia, dismissing the nurse's concerns and expressing her dislike for nurses. Alex Karev, another intern, introduced himself and suggested alternative diagnoses, but Cristina was offended when Alex mistook her for a nurse. Another intern asked Meredith about her relationship status, but Meredith shut down the conversation.

Suddenly, Katie Bryce suffered multiple grand mal seizures. Meredith was forced to make quick decisions about medication dosages as the team struggled to stabilize Katie, whose heart stopped. They performed defibrillation and revived her. Dr. Bailey scolded Meredith for not paging her immediately, leaving Meredith visibly shaken.

Katie's parents confronted Dr. Shepherd about the lack of answers regarding their daughter's condition. Mr. Bryce demanded another doctor, but Dr. Shepherd assured them he was doing everything possible. In another case, Dr. Burke explained bypass surgery to a patient named Tony and reassured Tony's wife, Gloria, promising a good outcome.

George and Cristina discussed the day's events, both feeling the weight of their failures. Dr. Shepherd gathered the interns and asked for help diagnosing Katie Bryce, offering the reward of scrubbing in on her surgery to whoever found the answer. Meredith and Cristina agreed to work together, though Cristina was reluctant to work with Dr. Shepherd. Meredith confided in Cristina that she had slept with Shepherd. Together, they reviewed Katie's case, ruling out various causes. Meredith realized that Katie's minor fall during rhythmic gymnastics could have caused a rare aneurysm. Meredith and Cristina presented their theory to Dr. Shepherd, who was skeptical but agreed to investigate. An angiogram confirmed a small subarachnoid hemorrhage. Dr. Shepherd praised their work and told Meredith she would scrub in on the surgery, leaving Cristina disappointed.

Meanwhile, Dr. Burke informed Gloria that Tony had not survived surgery due to extensive heart damage. Gloria was devastated and asked Dr. Burke to leave her alone. Cristina confronted Meredith about being chosen for the surgery, accusing her of benefiting from her relationship with Dr. Shepherd and her famous mother. Meredith tried to apologize, but Cristina told her to deal with it.

Meredith prepared Katie for surgery, keeping her promise to make Katie look “cool.” Before the operation, Meredith asked Dr. Shepherd if she had been chosen because they had slept together. Dr. Shepherd joked that she had, but then clarified that she had earned the opportunity on her own merit and encouraged her not to let their personal history interfere.

George and another intern reflected on their career choices and the expectations of their parents. George recalled his mother doubting his ability to become a surgeon but now felt proud to have proven himself. They wondered if they would survive the challenges ahead.

Later, Dr. Webber questioned an intern about a post-op patient, but the intern struggled to answer. Cristina correctly identified the five W's of post-op fever and suggested a pulmonary embolus. Dr. Webber instructed the team to follow Cristina's plan and recognized Meredith as Ellis Grey's daughter, welcoming her to the profession.

Dr. Shepherd prepared for Katie's surgery, telling the team it was a good night to save lives. Meredith reflected on the difficulty of being a surgeon and the many reasons to quit, but acknowledged the responsibility and privilege of holding lives in their hands. She admitted to loving the challenge, despite the hardships.

After the surgery, Meredith and Cristina avoided an emotional conversation, agreeing not to have a “moment.” Meredith insisted she looked better than Cristina, and they exchanged playful banter. George and another intern discussed the exhilaration of surgery, comparing it to a high and agreeing it was better than drugs. George left to attend to other duties.

Meredith narrated that she and the other interns had survived their first shift. She decided not to sell her mother's house and planned to get roommates instead. At the end of the day, Meredith visited her mother, Ellis Grey, who did not recognize her. Meredith gently reminded Ellis that she had been a surgeon, and Ellis vaguely recalled being a doctor.
