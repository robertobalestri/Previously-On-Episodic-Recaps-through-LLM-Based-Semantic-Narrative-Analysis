A young woman narrated about the pressures of becoming a surgeon, reflecting on how some people are naturally suited for the demands of the profession while others are not. She admitted to feeling unprepared, despite her mother's reputation as one of the greats. In a house, two people woke up together after a one-night stand. The woman, feeling embarrassed, tried to leave quickly, but the man insisted she go because he was late for his first day of work. They discussed the ownership of the house, revealing that it belonged to the man's mother and was being sold, though his mother was still alive. They agreed not to exchange personal details, but as the man went to shower, they finally introduced themselves as Derek and Meredith.

Later that morning, a group of new surgical interns gathered at the hospital. An authoritative figure addressed them, declaring that they were now doctors, not students, and warning that many would not make it through the residency program. Among the interns were Christina, George, and others, who discussed the gender ratio and rumors about one intern being a model. They speculated about their resident supervisor, referring to one as “the Nazi.” George introduced himself to a female intern, referencing a previous meeting. The group was called to attention as names were read off, and a female resident, Dr. Bailey, introduced herself. Dr. Bailey laid out five strict rules for the interns, making it clear she disliked them and expected them to memorize her rules.

A medical emergency interrupted the orientation: a 15-year-old girl named Katie Bryce was brought in with seizures. Dr. Bailey and Dr. Burke, along with interns including Izzy, Christina, George, and Meredith, responded to the crisis. Orders were given for medication and tests, and Meredith was assigned responsibility for Katie, tasked with taking her for a CT scan. Izzy was assigned to perform rectal exams.

Elsewhere, Dr. Bailey was approached by an intern, likely Christina, who reported that Katie Bryce's labs were clear and mentioned a rumor that the best intern would be allowed to perform a procedure on the first shift. Dr. Bailey dismissed her. In a patient room, Izzy talked with a patient about missing bacon after surgery, while George was told he was lost but denied it. Katie Bryce, frustrated about missing her pageant, discussed her talent—rhythmic gymnastics—with Izzy, who prepared to perform a rectal exam.

In the break area, several interns commiserated about their difficulties. One complained about performing seventeen rectal exams and feeling disliked by Dr. Bailey. The group gossiped about Meredith, revealing her mother was Ellis Gray, a famous surgeon, and discussed the pressure of living up to such a legacy. Katie Bryce was described as a difficult patient.

Dr. Burke gathered the interns and announced that George O'Malley would have the honor of performing the first surgery, an appendectomy. George was surprised and received congratulations. Two doctors discussed George's selection, with one doubting his abilities and the other insisting on choosing him as a tradition to “terrorize” one intern so the others would fall in line.

Katie Bryce's parents arrived and asked about her condition. Meredith was unable to answer their questions and went to find the attending doctor. She found Dr. Shepherd, who was revealed to be the same Derek from earlier. They awkwardly discussed their previous encounter and agreed to keep it secret, with Meredith insisting their relationship remain professional.

In the operating gallery, the interns watched as George began the appendectomy under supervision. He successfully removed the appendix but then made a mistake, causing a complication. Dr. Burke took over, and George was removed from the OR. The other interns began calling him “007,” meaning “license to kill.” Distressed, George asked if people were calling him 007; they denied it, but he suspected otherwise.

A code was called for Katie Bryce, and the interns rushed away. In a corridor, an intern lamented the difficulty of surgery and joked about geriatrics being easier, expressing a desire to move out of their mother's house. An intern arrived at Katie Bryce's room after a 911 page, only to find Katie was fine but bored and wanted to watch her pageant on TV. The intern, frustrated, told her to go to sleep.

Meredith asked another intern for help starting a central line on a patient with difficult veins. The intern admitted never having done one before, and they considered asking Dr. Bailey for help. Meredith approached Dr. Bailey, who was sleeping, to ask for help with the central line. Dr. Bailey was annoyed and told Meredith not to wake her unless the patient was near death.

In a patient care area, an intern suggested starting antibiotics for a patient with post-op pneumonia. A nurse questioned the diagnosis, suggesting alternatives, but the intern was dismissive. Another intern, Alex, introduced himself and made a derogatory comment about nurses. The group discussed Katie and relationships.

Suddenly, Katie Bryce began having multiple grand mal seizures. Dr. Bailey asked Meredith how to proceed. Meredith gave medication orders, but the seizures continued. Dr. Bailey and the team tried various interventions, including phenobarbital. Katie's heart stopped, and the team performed resuscitation. After several attempts, Katie's heart rhythm returned. Dr. Bailey reprimanded the team for not paging her immediately.

Katie's parents confronted Dr. Shepherd about their daughter's condition, frustrated by the lack of answers. Dr. Shepherd assured them he was working hard but could not yet provide a diagnosis. The parents demanded another doctor.

Dr. Burke discussed an upcoming bypass surgery with a patient named Mr. Savage and his wife, Gloria, explaining the procedure and risks. An intern reassured Gloria, promising her husband would be fine. Dr. Burke admonished the intern for making promises to patients' families.

In a break room, Meredith was suturing a banana to stay awake. Christina confronted her about getting to scrub in on Katie's surgery. Meredith apologized for being mean when tired. Dr. Shepherd entered and asked the interns for help diagnosing Katie Bryce, explaining her condition was a mystery. He offered the incentive that whoever found the answer could scrub in on the surgery.

An intern paged Dr. Bailey about the patient in 4B, who was still short of breath. Dr. Bailey dismissed the concern, attributing it to the patient's age and told the intern not to page her again.

Christina approached Meredith and proposed working together to solve Katie's case, offering Meredith the chance to scrub in if they succeeded. Meredith agreed. They reviewed Katie's symptoms and ruled out various causes. Meredith revealed to Christina that she had slept with Dr. Shepherd. Christina asked if it was good, and they continued brainstorming possible diagnoses. They discussed the implications if no one could diagnose Katie and she died, reflecting on Katie's life and her pageant talent, rhythmic gymnastics. Meredith suddenly had an idea related to Katie's fall during pageant practice.

Meredith and Christina approached Dr. Shepherd with their theory that Katie's seizures were due to a subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a minor fall during rhythmic gymnastics. Dr. Shepherd was initially skeptical but ordered further investigation. The team confirmed that Katie had a minute subarachnoid hemorrhage. Dr. Shepherd praised Meredith and Christina for their work and told Meredith she would scrub in on the surgery. Christina was disappointed about not being chosen.

Dr. Burke informed Gloria that her husband, Tony, died during surgery due to extensive heart damage. Gloria was devastated. Dr. Burke told the intern who had promised Gloria a good outcome that only God could make such promises and instructed the intern to deliver the bad news. Christina confronted Meredith about being chosen for the surgery, accusing her of getting ahead because of her relationship with Dr. Shepherd and her famous mother. Meredith insisted she earned her place. Christina told her to deal with the consequences of her actions.

The intern delivered the news to Gloria that Tony had died. Gloria was distraught and asked for privacy.

In a hospital room, Meredith helped prepare Katie Bryce for surgery, promising to make her look “cool” despite having to shave her head. Meredith asked Dr. Shepherd if she was chosen for the surgery because they slept together. Dr. Shepherd joked but assured her she earned it, encouraging her not to let their personal history interfere with her opportunity.

In a quiet moment, George and another intern discussed their doubts about being surgeons. George reflected on his parents' pride and his own insecurities. Meredith shared that her mother tried to talk her out of medical school. They agreed that being seen as a “superhero” sounded good and hoped they would survive the program.

A senior doctor quizzed an intern about a patient with post-op fever. The intern struggled to answer, but another intern correctly listed the five Ws of post-op fever and suggested the patient might have a pulmonary embolus. The senior doctor instructed the team to follow the correct diagnostic steps and requested the struggling intern be removed from the case. The senior doctor recognized Meredith as Ellis Gray's daughter and welcomed her.

Dr. Shepherd gathered the surgical team and declared it a “beautiful night to save lives,” encouraging the team to have fun. Meredith narrated about the challenges of being a surgeon and the reasons to quit, but concluded that she loved the work.

In a break area, Meredith and Christina agreed not to have an emotional conversation. Christina told Meredith to get some sleep, and they exchanged banter about who looked worse. After surgery, an intern expressed amazement at the experience, describing it as a high better than drugs. Another intern agreed. One suggested they go do something, and the other encouraged them. They parted ways, saying “see you around.”

Meredith narrated that she and the other interns survived their first shift. She reflected that the other interns were good people and decided not to sell her mother's house, planning to get roommates instead. Meredith visited her mother, who was in a care facility and did not recognize her. Meredith introduced herself. Her mother, Ellis, vaguely recalled being a doctor. Meredith confirmed that her mother was a surgeon.
