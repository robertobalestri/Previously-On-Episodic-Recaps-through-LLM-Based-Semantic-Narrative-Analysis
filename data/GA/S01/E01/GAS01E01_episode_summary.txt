Meredith Grey began her story by reflecting on the pressures of becoming a surgeon, especially in the shadow of her mother's celebrated career. After waking up beside Derek, a man she had spent the night with, Meredith felt embarrassed and hurriedly urged him to leave, anxious about being late for her first day as a surgical intern. Derek tried to prolong their flirtation, but Meredith insisted he go, and they awkwardly exchanged names before she rushed out.

Arriving at Seattle Grace Hospital, Meredith joined the other new interns—Cristina Yang, George O'Malley, and Izzie Stevens—for orientation. Meredith's internal monologue revealed her anxiety about the difficult road ahead, knowing that only a few interns would survive the demanding residency. Dr. Richard Webber, the Chief of Surgery, called out names and assigned the interns to their posts. Cristina remarked on the low number of women among the interns, while George mentioned that one intern was rumored to be a model.

The interns were introduced to Dr. Miranda Bailey, who was known for her strictness and was nicknamed "the Nazi." Bailey laid out her five rules for survival: no sucking up, answer every page at a run, don't wake her unless a patient is dying, don't let a dying patient be dead when she arrives, and always move when she moves. The group was immediately thrust into action when a 15-year-old patient named Katie Bryce was brought in with seizures. Bailey assigned Cristina to run labs, George to patient workups, Meredith to take Katie for a CT scan, and Izzie to perform rectal exams on patients.

As the interns struggled with their new responsibilities, Meredith and Cristina discussed Katie's puzzling case, noting that her labs were clear and there was no obvious cause for her seizures. George hoped to be chosen for a surgical procedure, since it was rumored that the best intern would get the opportunity on the first shift. Katie, frustrated about missing her beauty pageant, was sarcastic with the interns. Izzie, overwhelmed by the number of rectal exams, complained that Bailey hated her.

The interns gossiped about Meredith's mother, Ellis Grey, who was a legendary surgeon. Cristina envied Meredith's background, while Izzie admired Ellis's accomplishments. Alex Karev, another intern, joined the group, making crude jokes and antagonizing Izzie by calling her a nurse.

Bailey surprised everyone by announcing that George had been chosen to scrub in for an appendectomy. Cristina and Alex doubted George's abilities and even bet on his failure. In the operating room, George started out well but panicked and made a mistake, causing complications. Dr. Burke, the attending surgeon, took over, and George was left humiliated. The other interns began calling him "007," implying he had a "license to kill" after his near-fatal error.

Katie's condition deteriorated, and the interns scrambled to manage her worsening seizures. Meredith and Cristina worked together to try to diagnose her, reviewing her medical history and ruling out various causes. During this time, Meredith confided in Cristina that she had slept with Dr. Shepherd, who turned out to be Derek, the attending neurosurgeon. Cristina, however, was more interested in solving Katie's case than Meredith's personal life.

Derek gathered the interns and asked for their help in diagnosing Katie, promising that whoever found the answer would assist in her surgery. Meredith and Cristina collaborated and eventually realized that Katie's seizures could be the result of a subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a minor fall during a rhythmic gymnastics rehearsal. They presented their findings to Derek, who confirmed the diagnosis and prepared for surgery. Derek chose Meredith to scrub in, explaining that she had earned the opportunity by helping save Katie's life, not because of their personal connection.

Meanwhile, George was devastated after he had promised a patient's family that their loved one would be fine, only for the patient to die during surgery. Bailey reprimanded George, warning him never to promise a good outcome. Izzie and Cristina argued about the cutthroat nature of the program, with Cristina accusing Izzie of not earning her opportunities.

Meredith decided not to sell her mother's house and planned to find roommates. She visited her mother, Ellis Grey, who was suffering from memory loss and did not recognize Meredith as her daughter. Meredith gently reminded Ellis that she had been a surgeon.

As the first shift ended, Meredith reflected on the challenges and pressures of being a surgeon, admitting that despite the reasons to quit, she loved the work. Derek, Cristina, Izzie, Alex, and George all struggled with the demands of their first day, but they survived. Meredith and Derek shared a brief, professional exchange, agreeing not to make things awkward between them. Meredith concluded that, despite everything, she was staying in the game.
