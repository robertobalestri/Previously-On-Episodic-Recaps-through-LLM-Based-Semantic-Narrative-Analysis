A speaker reflected on the nature of “the game,” observing that some people are born to play it while others are not. The speaker admitted to feeling inadequate compared to their mother, who was one of the greats. In a house, Meredith Grey woke up next to a man she barely knew. Embarrassed by the situation, Meredith told the man he had to leave because she was late for her first day of work. As they discussed the house, Meredith explained that it belonged to her mother and was being sold, but clarified that her mother was still alive. They agreed not to exchange personal details, and Meredith went upstairs to shower, instructing him to be gone when she returned. Before parting, they finally exchanged names: Derek and Meredith.

At Seattle Grace Hospital, Dr. Richard Webber addressed a group of new interns, including Meredith Grey, Cristina Yang, George O'Malley, Izzie Stevens, and Alex Karev. Dr. Webber welcomed them as doctors, warning them about the intense competition and high risk of failure in the program. Internally, Meredith repeated to herself that she felt “screwed.” The interns gathered and discussed the gender imbalance among them and rumors that one intern was a model. Cristina Yang, George O'Malley, and others talked about being assigned to a resident known as “the Nazi.” George introduced himself to Meredith, referencing a previous encounter, and the group discussed the reputation of Ellis Grey, Meredith's mother, as a famous surgeon. They soon located Dr. Miranda Bailey, who revealed herself as “the Nazi.” Dr. Bailey introduced herself and laid out five strict rules, emphasizing discipline, hierarchy, and that she was not to be woken unless a patient was dying. She assigned Cristina to labs, George to patient work-ups, Meredith to take a patient named Katie for a CT scan, and another intern to rectal exams.

Katie Bryce, a 15-year-old patient, was brought in with seizures. The team worked to stabilize her, and Dr. Preston Burke instructed Dr. Bailey to order a full battery of tests. Cristina reported that Katie's labs were clear and mentioned a rumor that the best intern would get to perform a procedure, but Dr. Bailey dismissed her. Meanwhile, Izzie Stevens reassured a patient about an upcoming bypass surgery. Meredith, lost in the hospital, checked on Katie, who was upset about missing her beauty pageant and displayed a sarcastic, difficult attitude. The interns gathered in the break room, where Alex Karev complained about performing seventeen rectal exams and feeling disliked by Dr. Bailey. The group discussed Meredith's famous mother and the pressure of living up to her reputation. Meredith vented about Katie's behavior.

Dr. Burke announced that George would perform the first surgery, an appendectomy. The other interns were skeptical of George's abilities. Dr. Burke and Dr. Webber discussed George, noting that he barely made it into the program and was being set up to fail as an example. Meredith checked on Katie and her parents, who had questions about her condition. Meredith deferred to the attending, Dr. Derek Shepherd, who was revealed to be the same Derek from Meredith's earlier encounter. Meredith and Derek awkwardly discussed their prior meeting and agreed to keep it secret. Meredith insisted that their personal history could not affect their professional relationship, but Derek joked and asked her out again, which she refused.

The interns watched as George prepared to perform the appendectomy under Dr. Burke's supervision. They bet on whether he would succeed or fail. George began the surgery and initially performed well, but then made a mistake that caused complications. Dr. Burke took over and called George a “pansy-ass idiot.” The other interns nicknamed George “007,” meaning “license to kill.” George was upset about the nickname, and although his peers denied it, he knew it was spreading. Cristina received a page about Katie and left. George lamented his failure and considered switching specialties. Meredith expressed her frustration about living with her mother.

Meredith was paged to Katie's room, where Katie had faked an emergency out of boredom. Meredith scolded her and told her to sleep. Cristina asked Izzie for help starting a central line on a patient. They considered waking Dr. Bailey, but when they did, Dr. Bailey was furious and warned them not to wake her again unless the patient was near death. Cristina was then given samples to take to the lab. Alex discussed a post-op patient with possible pneumonia and insisted on antibiotics despite a nurse's questions. Alex introduced himself to Izzie and made a sexist remark, mistaking her for a nurse.

George awkwardly tried to befriend Meredith. Suddenly, Katie began having multiple grand mal seizures. The team tried various medications, but nothing worked. Meredith was pressured to make decisions. Katie's heart stopped, and the team performed a code blue. After several attempts, they revived her. Dr. Bailey scolded Meredith for not paging her immediately. Katie's parents confronted Dr. Shepherd about the lack of a diagnosis, and Mr. Bryce demanded a more competent doctor.

Meanwhile, Mr. Savitch was prepared for bypass surgery. His wife, Gloria Savitch, was reassured by Izzie, who promised a good outcome. Dr. Burke admonished Izzie for making promises to patients' families. Dr. Shepherd gathered the interns and asked for their help diagnosing Katie, offering the incentive of assisting in surgery to whoever found the answer. Dr. Bailey distributed Katie's chart, and the interns began working on the case. Cristina and Meredith agreed to work together, with Meredith declining the opportunity to assist in surgery if they succeeded. They reviewed possible diagnoses and eliminated several options. Meredith confided in Cristina that she had slept with Dr. Shepherd. They continued brainstorming but ran out of ideas. Meredith realized that Katie's minor fall during rhythmic gymnastics practice could have caused a rare aneurysm. Meredith and Cristina presented their theory to Dr. Shepherd, who was initially skeptical. Meredith explained that Katie's minor fall could have ruptured an undetected aneurysm. They performed an angiogram and discovered a small subarachnoid hemorrhage. Dr. Shepherd praised their work and told Meredith she would assist in the surgery.

Dr. Burke informed Izzie that Mr. Savitch's heart was too damaged for bypass surgery and he died. Izzie was upset, having promised the patient's wife a good outcome. Dr. Burke reprimanded her for making promises and instructed her to deliver the bad news. Izzie delivered the news to Gloria Savitch, who was devastated and asked Izzie to leave. Izzie helped Katie prepare for surgery, fulfilling a promise to make her look “cool.”

Meredith asked Dr. Shepherd if she was chosen for the surgery because they had slept together. He joked, then assured her she earned it by helping save Katie's life. He encouraged her not to let their personal history interfere with her career. George and Izzie reflected on their career choices and the expectations of their families. George felt inadequate, while Izzie recalled being discouraged by her mother. They agreed that being seen as a “superhero” was not so bad and wondered if they would survive the internship.

Dr. Webber questioned Alex about a post-op patient with shortness of breath. Alex was unable to answer, but Meredith correctly identified the five common causes of post-op fever and suggested the patient might have a pulmonary embolus. Dr. Webber instructed Alex to follow Meredith's recommendations and recognized her as Ellis Grey's daughter, welcoming her to the profession.

Dr. Shepherd prepared for Katie's surgery, telling the team it was a beautiful night to save lives. Meredith reflected on the challenges of being a surgeon and the many reasons to quit, but admitted to loving the work despite its difficulties. After surgery, Meredith and Dr. Shepherd agreed not to have an emotional conversation. Meredith and Cristina exchanged banter about their appearance and exhaustion. George expressed excitement after assisting in surgery, describing the experience as a high. He and Izzie agreed that surgery was exhilarating. Meredith reflected on surviving the first shift along with the other interns. She decided to keep her mother's house and considered getting roommates. Finally, Meredith visited her mother, Ellis Grey, who was in a care facility and did not recognize her. Meredith gently reminded her mother that she was a surgeon.
