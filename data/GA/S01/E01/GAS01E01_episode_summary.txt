Meredith Grey began her first day as a surgical intern feeling overwhelmed by the legacy of her mother, Ellis Grey, a renowned surgeon. The morning started with Meredith waking up beside Derek Shepherd, a man she had met at a bar the previous night. Embarrassed by the one-night stand and eager to make a good impression on her first day, Meredith hurried Derek out of her house. They exchanged names and parted ways, agreeing not to pretend there was anything more between them.

At Seattle Grace Hospital, Dr. Richard Webber welcomed the new class of surgical interns, warning them about the intense competition and grueling demands of residency. Meredith joined fellow interns Cristina Yang, Izzie Stevens, and George O'Malley as they were introduced to their supervisor, Dr. Miranda Bailey, who was infamous for her strictness and was known as “the Nazi.” Cristina and Izzie were surprised to find that Dr. Bailey was a woman, while George nervously tried to make friends with his new colleagues.

Dr. Bailey laid out her five rules for the interns, emphasizing discipline and quick responses. The group was immediately assigned their first patient, Katie Bryce, a fifteen-year-old girl suffering from unexplained seizures. Meredith was given responsibility for Katie and took her for a CT scan, while Cristina, Izzie, and George discussed the pressures of their new roles and speculated about Dr. Bailey's tough reputation. They also teased George about his nerves, especially after Dr. Bailey selected him to perform the first surgery of their class—an appendectomy. Despite Cristina's doubts, George entered the operating room with the support of his fellow interns, who placed bets on his success. During the procedure, George initially performed well but made a critical mistake, forcing Dr. Burke to take over. The incident earned George the nickname “007” for his “license to kill.”

As Katie Bryce's condition deteriorated, Meredith and Cristina teamed up to solve the mystery behind her seizures, agreeing to share the reward of scrubbing in on the surgery if they succeeded. Meredith confided in Cristina about her night with Derek Shepherd, complicating her feelings as she realized he was one of the attending surgeons. Meanwhile, the interns faced other medical challenges, including a post-operative patient with a fever. Cristina correctly diagnosed the cause as a pulmonary embolus, demonstrating her medical acumen.

Meredith and Cristina continued to investigate Katie's case, eventually deducing that a minor fall during rhythmic gymnastics practice had caused a rare subarachnoid hemorrhage. They presented their findings to Derek Shepherd, who confirmed the diagnosis and prepared for surgery. Derek praised Meredith and Cristina for their work and invited Meredith to scrub in on the operation, assuring her that she had earned the opportunity through her efforts, not because of their personal connection. Though hesitant at first, Meredith accepted and experienced the thrill of participating in her first surgery.

Elsewhere in the hospital, Dr. Burke performed heart surgery on a patient named Mr. Savage, but complications arose and the patient died. George was given the difficult task of informing Mr. Savage's wife, Gloria, about her husband's death. The experience weighed heavily on George, and Derek Shepherd reminded him not to make promises to patients' families, as only God could guarantee outcomes.

At the end of their exhausting first day, the interns gathered to reflect on their doubts, fears, and hopes for the future. Meredith decided not to sell her mother's house and instead planned to find roommates, determined to make it her own home. She visited Ellis Grey, who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and introduced herself, acknowledging her mother's legacy as a surgeon.

As the day closed, Meredith considered the challenges and rewards of being a surgeon. Despite the hardships, she realized she loved the work and resolved to stay and fight for her place in the hospital.
