1
00:00:00,381 --> 00:00:02,391
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,643 --> 00:00:04,134
We had sex -- once.

3
00:00:04,215 --> 00:00:05,050
Go out with me.

4
00:00:05,176 --> 00:00:06,304
You know you're my boss.

5
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,517
You know it's against the rules.

6
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,472
Do you like Izzie? Is that what this is about?

7
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,716
Izzie? No. She's not the one I'm attracted to.

8
00:00:11,753 --> 00:00:13,314
Not the one. So there's a one.

9
00:00:13,385 --> 00:00:15,775
Haven't you ever been attracted to someone you couldn't have?

10
00:00:16,403 --> 00:00:17,204
Meredith.

11
00:00:18,141 --> 00:00:19,041
Just coffee.

12
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,182
Good.

13
00:00:20,318 --> 00:00:20,910
Okay.

14
00:00:21,023 --> 00:00:21,592
Okay.

15
00:00:21,658 --> 00:00:23,568
But your mother's alzheimer's is advancing.

16
00:00:23,645 --> 00:00:25,769
So while she's still lucid enough to consent,

17
00:00:25,827 --> 00:00:27,679
she needs to sign everything over to you.

18
00:00:27,782 --> 00:00:28,401
Me?

19
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,126
Thanks for the coffee.

20
00:00:35,126 --> 00:00:37,025
So, you blew me off for a bottle of tequila.

21
00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:39,036
That's not nearly as much fun to wake up to.

22
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,257
You mind moving this tail wagon?

23
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:43,624
You're blocking me in.

24
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:48,422
A couple hundred years ago,

25
00:00:48,493 --> 00:00:52,533
Benjamin Franklin shared with the world the secret of his success --

26
00:00:52,973 --> 00:00:57,835
"never leave that till tomorrow," he said, "what you can do today."

27
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:06,542
This is the man who discovered electricity.

28
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:09,654
You'd think more of us would listen to what he had to say.

29
00:01:14,895 --> 00:01:17,412
I don't know why we put things off,

30
00:01:17,816 --> 00:01:19,214
but if I had to guess,

31
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,080
I'd say it has a lot to do with fear --

32
00:01:24,504 --> 00:01:25,635
fear of failure,

33
00:01:26,162 --> 00:01:27,089
fear of pain,

34
00:01:27,877 --> 00:01:28,976
fear of rejection.

35
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:36,340
Wouldn't it be easier to just ask her out?

36
00:01:51,223 --> 00:01:52,734
- She's gonna be late.
- Maybe not.

37
00:01:55,552 --> 00:01:57,521
- We should wait for her.
- Definitely not.

38
00:01:58,153 --> 00:02:01,781
I'm not her mother, and you are not her boyfriend -- not yet, anyway.

39
00:02:01,832 --> 00:02:04,024
Stop, okay? I told you I'm not interested.

40
00:02:04,726 --> 00:02:06,056
Life is short, George.

41
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:08,718
Do you really want to die before you ever ask her out?

42
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:10,748
I do not want to ask her out.

43
00:02:11,945 --> 00:02:13,451
Do you really want to die a liar?

44
00:02:13,516 --> 00:02:14,238
I'm not --

45
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,183
I'm not dying.

46
00:02:18,395 --> 00:02:20,961
Sometimes, the fear is just of making a decision...

47
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,364
because what if you're wrong?

48
00:02:25,775 --> 00:02:27,827
What if you're making a mistake you can't undo?

49
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:30,203
Crap.

50
00:02:30,602 --> 00:02:31,401
Crap?

51
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:33,039
Hi. I'm late.

52
00:02:33,563 --> 00:02:34,653
You're avoiding me.

53
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:36,439
Yes, but also late.

54
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,417
Oh, are we gonna talk about this?

55
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,132
No.

56
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:41,083
About us and Bailey and what she saw?

57
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:44,596
I don't need to talk about it. I experienced it... naked.

58
00:02:44,846 --> 00:02:46,570
This is getting complicated.

59
00:02:46,648 --> 00:02:47,758
Complicated for me.

60
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:49,608
I'm the intern sleeping with the attending.

61
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,712
Bailey isn't speaking to me anymore.

62
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:53,293
Not that that's a bad thing.

63
00:02:53,988 --> 00:02:56,494
If I was a better guy, I'd walk away.

64
00:02:56,566 --> 00:02:57,365
Yes, you would.

65
00:02:59,686 --> 00:03:01,098
Do you want me to be a better guy?

66
00:03:01,238 --> 00:03:02,157
Yes.

67
00:03:04,707 --> 00:03:05,428
No.

68
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,045
Crap.

69
00:03:08,846 --> 00:03:09,887
I'm late.

70
00:03:10,968 --> 00:03:11,906
Take your time.

71
00:03:13,352 --> 00:03:14,292
Think about it.

72
00:03:24,102 --> 00:03:24,854
Thanks.

73
00:03:28,551 --> 00:03:31,980
Is this a -- should we talk about this?

74
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,252
Yeah, definitely.

75
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:48,729
You're late.

76
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:49,861
So are you.

77
00:03:49,972 --> 00:03:52,335
I know, and I can't afford to piss off Bailey any more.

78
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:53,665
Do you think she told anyone?

79
00:03:54,004 --> 00:03:54,926
About you and Mcdreamy?

80
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:56,081
- Yeah.
- No.

81
00:03:56,323 --> 00:03:57,468
He's her boss, too.

82
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,151
If they find out, what can they -- can they kick me out, or...

83
00:04:00,203 --> 00:04:01,069
No...

84
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:02,840
Not officially.

85
00:04:03,403 --> 00:04:07,309
You'll just get edged out, blacklisted,

86
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,035
banned from his surgeries,

87
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:11,390
passed over for chief resident.

88
00:04:12,537 --> 00:04:14,902
It'll be humiliating, but you'll live.

89
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:16,317
I have to end it.

90
00:04:17,134 --> 00:04:19,188
I definitely have to end it.

91
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,635
I have to end it, right?

92
00:04:22,035 --> 00:04:23,438
Meredith, shut up.

93
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:24,498
What?

94
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:28,375
Did you seriously just tell me to shut up?

95
00:04:28,422 --> 00:04:29,419
Oh, please.

96
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,588
You got a hot doctor who likes to make you open up and say "ahh."

97
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:34,625
It's the american dream. Stop whining about it.

98
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:37,365
No. No good can come from sleeping with your boss.

99
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:38,532
Cristina,  you're late.

100
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,766
So is Meredith.

101
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:43,448
Whatever it is we're afraid of, one thing holds true --

102
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:48,007
if, by the time the pain of not doing a thing gets worse than the fear of doing it,

103
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,954
it can feel like we're carrying around a giant tumor.

104
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,641
When we walk in this door, you will maintain decorum.

105
00:04:53,704 --> 00:04:56,703
You will not laugh, vomit, or drop your jaw.

106
00:04:56,785 --> 00:04:57,732
Are we understood?

107
00:04:58,075 --> 00:04:59,049
Why would we laugh?

108
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:00,266
Oh, just you wait.

109
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:02,181
Good morning, Miss Connors.

110
00:05:02,397 --> 00:05:03,119
Good morning.

111
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,009
What  is it?

112
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,360
Tumor.

113
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:12,887
And you thought I was speaking metaphorically.

114
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:45,384
Good morning, Annie.

115
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,877
How are you? This is Dr. Bailey, and these are my fellow interns.

116
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,226
Dr. Karev, we refer to patients as "mister" --

117
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,547
I told him to call me "Annie."

118
00:05:52,993 --> 00:05:56,127
"Ms. Connors" makes me feel old and fat,

119
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:58,927
which I am, but why feel that way?

120
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:00,822
Good morning.

121
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:03,095
Oh, Annie, this is Dr. Burke --

122
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,416
awesome surgeon.

123
00:06:06,054 --> 00:06:07,196
Dr. Karev.

124
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:11,323
Oh, Annie Connors is a 43-year-old woman who presented last night

125
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,359
with progressive shortness of breath for the past three months.

126
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:20,477
Found to have a very large tumor of unknown origin pressed against her diaphragm.

127
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:23,391
Stable vital signs. Scheduled for C.T. this morning, sir.

128
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:24,753
Thank you, Dr. Karev.

129
00:06:25,724 --> 00:06:27,375
Are you at all claustrophobic?

130
00:06:27,457 --> 00:06:30,318
I've been housebound for the last year. How claustrophobic could I be?

131
00:06:31,204 --> 00:06:32,094
All right, then.

132
00:06:32,473 --> 00:06:34,926
Dr. Stevens is going to take you up for a C.T.

133
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,439
It'll give us a better look at the tumor, and we'll know how to proceed from there.

134
00:06:38,561 --> 00:06:40,126
Could someone tell my mom?

135
00:06:40,395 --> 00:06:42,769
She'll worry if she gets back and I'm not here.

136
00:06:42,883 --> 00:06:44,198
Yeah, of course. Of course.

137
00:06:44,332 --> 00:06:47,824
And would it be possible for Alex to take me instead?

138
00:06:48,403 --> 00:06:52,131
I mean, he -- he's just so fun to look at.

139
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:54,924
Annie.

140
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:55,760
Sure.

141
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,173
Sure, Ms. Connors.

142
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,331
Excuse me.

143
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,788
- How much do you think it weighs?
- 60 pounds.

144
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:06,271
More. She's carrying around a whole extra person.

145
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,622
This one's going in the books.

146
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,700
- I've got to get in.
- I almost did.

147
00:07:09,902 --> 00:07:12,487
Have you ever seen Alex like that? He actually seemed sincere.

148
00:07:12,575 --> 00:07:13,953
"Seemed" being the operative word.

149
00:07:14,023 --> 00:07:15,538
He was on call when she came in.

150
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,315
I am never leaving this place again.

151
00:07:18,477 --> 00:07:19,568
Let's move, people.

152
00:07:19,865 --> 00:07:22,584
Ms. Connor's surgery, should we choose to proceed,

153
00:07:22,763 --> 00:07:25,220
will take most, if not all, of the surgeons off the floor,

154
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:28,896
which means you people will have to work extra hard not to kill anyone,

155
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:31,289
'cause we won't be there to fix your mistakes.

156
00:07:31,395 --> 00:07:32,173
Dr. Burke.

157
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:37,565
I really want in on this.

158
00:07:38,594 --> 00:07:39,766
I thought we weren't talking.

159
00:07:39,982 --> 00:07:41,502
I'm not talking. I'm just saying.

160
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:47,441
Find her mother, get a family history, and I'll tell Bailey.

161
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:52,270
Mr. Harper had a coronary bypass yesterday.

162
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,876
His blood pressure, currently 100/65.

163
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:59,807
It was running low overnight down to 70/30, but responded to medication.

164
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,119
Postoperative labs show a crit of 30 and normal coagulation.

165
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,874
Chest-tube output has halted over the last two hours.

166
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:06,780
What's your plan?

167
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,704
Chest x-ray and check the tube for possible occlusion.

168
00:08:09,932 --> 00:08:10,605
Good.

169
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,930
He's doing fine.

170
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,220
Thank you.

171
00:08:23,693 --> 00:08:26,615
I know you think I like Meredith, but I don't like Meredith.

172
00:08:27,101 --> 00:08:27,624
What?

173
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,040
No. I like Meredith. Obviously, I like Meredith.

174
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:32,256
I just -- I just don't have a thing for her.

175
00:08:32,641 --> 00:08:33,271
Okay.

176
00:08:33,348 --> 00:08:36,435
It's just this morning -- I know you were probably just teasing,

177
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,364
but I don't want you to say anything like that to her, because we live together,

178
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:40,500
and that would be really awkward.

179
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,395
- George, stop talking.
- Okay.

180
00:08:48,143 --> 00:08:49,051
Morning.

181
00:08:50,812 --> 00:08:54,663
Mr. Levangie, this is Dr. Bailey and her fine staff of surgical interns.

182
00:09:00,612 --> 00:09:02,380
Welcome to hell, kids.

183
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:06,187
Who's presenting?

184
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:11,043
Edward Levangie is a 63-year-old man admitted for pain management for dyskinesia.

185
00:09:11,123 --> 00:09:14,825
He's been stable since last night and responding well to the bolus injections.

186
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:16,541
Izzie, possible treatments?

187
00:09:16,632 --> 00:09:17,775
For parkinson's disease?

188
00:09:17,922 --> 00:09:21,911
- Deep brain stimulation has shown very -- 
- Not for parkinson's -- for spinal pain.

189
00:09:25,818 --> 00:09:30,651
Intraspinal catheter -- that way, he can have constant pain medication.

190
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:31,755
Excellent.

191
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:33,242
This is Dr. Grey.

192
00:09:33,354 --> 00:09:35,951
She's gonna prep you for the procedure and assist.

193
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:40,211
Excuse me.

194
00:09:45,826 --> 00:09:48,346
You make yourselves busy. I'll catch up with you.

195
00:10:05,376 --> 00:10:06,178
Miranda.

196
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:07,265
Excuse me?

197
00:10:07,843 --> 00:10:09,046
Well, that's your name, right?

198
00:10:09,132 --> 00:10:10,127
It's  on your jacket.

199
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:12,139
All right, fine, I'll just call you "Bailey" then.

200
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:16,634
You think you're charming in that talented, neurotic, overly moussed hair sort of way.

201
00:10:16,696 --> 00:10:17,761
Good for you.

202
00:10:17,853 --> 00:10:20,602
But  if you think I'm gonna stand back and watch while you favor her --

203
00:10:20,674 --> 00:10:22,241
I don't favor her. She's good.

204
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:23,721
I'm sure she is.

205
00:10:23,808 --> 00:10:26,317
Can I point out that, technically, I'm your boss.

206
00:10:26,404 --> 00:10:27,586
You don't scare me.

207
00:10:27,832 --> 00:10:32,139
Look, I'm not gonna advertise your extracurricular activities with my intern.

208
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,547
However, the next time I see you favoring Meredith Grey in any way,

209
00:10:35,716 --> 00:10:38,819
I'll make sure she doesn't see the inside of an O.R. for a month...

210
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,303
just for the sake of balance.

211
00:10:44,873 --> 00:10:46,386
- We're all set, doc.
- Okay.

212
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,492
Annie... there's gonna be a microphone in there for you in case you get scared

213
00:10:51,558 --> 00:10:54,390
or you want to get out, but try not to do that,

214
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:57,277
because then we're gonna have to start all over again.

215
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,157
I'm fine. I'll be fine.

216
00:10:59,244 --> 00:11:02,204
I know you're gonna be fine, because I'm gonna be right over there,

217
00:11:02,276 --> 00:11:04,211
behind that glass, waiting for you.

218
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:06,094
All right?

219
00:11:06,295 --> 00:11:06,882
Okay.

220
00:11:06,964 --> 00:11:07,661
You  ready?

221
00:11:07,825 --> 00:11:08,987
Are you really ready?

222
00:11:09,714 --> 00:11:10,508
Let's do this.

223
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:11,819
See ya.

224
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:22,376
Oh, hey, man, you got an extra battery?

225
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:24,383
Unbelievable.

226
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,333
Oh, I know, right?

227
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:28,925
I've never seen anything like this.

228
00:11:29,118 --> 00:11:29,944
God.

229
00:11:30,348 --> 00:11:33,881
Yeah, well, what I don't understand is how a person lets it get like that.

230
00:11:33,948 --> 00:11:37,573
I mean, man, that is a whole lot of nasty.

231
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:39,114
Maybe she's afraid of doctors.

232
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:40,547
Poor thing.

233
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:41,935
Poor thing? Please.

234
00:11:42,196 --> 00:11:44,192
If you're afraid of doctors, you take a pill.

235
00:11:44,316 --> 00:11:47,633
She's just sick, like, warped, you know?

236
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,191
Seriously, I don't know how she lives with herself.

237
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:57,802
Well, at first, we thought she was just putting on weight.

238
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,313
When we realized what was happening, I tried to get her to go to the doctor,

239
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,924
but she was scared.

240
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:07,418
And the bigger it got, the less she wanted to go.

241
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:11,503
And she never really felt all that sick until last night.

242
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:13,366
She couldn't breathe.

243
00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:16,023
Because the tumor was crushing her lungs.

244
00:12:16,105 --> 00:12:18,235
Yes, well, I called 911.

245
00:12:18,732 --> 00:12:20,990
It just seemed like the right thing to do.

246
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:26,694
The right thing to do would have been to call a year ago.

247
00:12:29,075 --> 00:12:30,002
Thank you.

248
00:12:32,474 --> 00:12:34,139
Okay, Mr. Levangie.

249
00:12:35,884 --> 00:12:38,030
We're gonna get you more comfortable, okay?

250
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:41,527
I'm gonna go downstairs, and I'll be back up shortly.

251
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:42,731
- Okay.
- Okay.

252
00:12:46,295 --> 00:12:47,594
Excuse me.

253
00:12:48,706 --> 00:12:51,204
- I'm sorry, doctor... 
- Grey.

254
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:52,699
My dad seems to like you.

255
00:12:52,796 --> 00:12:54,210
He's always liked skinny blondes.

256
00:12:55,126 --> 00:12:57,000
Is that rude? I'm sorry. I'm so tired.

257
00:12:57,532 --> 00:12:58,614
Is there something...

258
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,345
I was wondering if you would talk to him.

259
00:13:01,853 --> 00:13:04,025
- About?
- Brain surgery.

260
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,132
The doctor mentioned it, and I've read about it on-line.

261
00:13:07,373 --> 00:13:11,239
If it worked, it could help with most of his symptoms, not just pain.

262
00:13:11,787 --> 00:13:14,845
- Is he a candidate?
- He is, but he's afraid of it.

263
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:17,659
Surgery on his back, he can understand, but his brain --

264
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:20,322
and... there are risks.

265
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,014
- But his quality of life -- 
- There isn't any.

266
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:25,635
And it keeps getting worse.

267
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:29,184
I'm getting married next month.

268
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:31,156
I already lost my mom.

269
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,254
And I want him to walk...

270
00:13:35,758 --> 00:13:38,328
I want him with me. Maybe that's selfish, but...

271
00:13:39,066 --> 00:13:41,043
you don't know what it's like having a parent --

272
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,029
watching him...

273
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:45,225
I do.

274
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:47,422
I do know what it's like.

275
00:13:48,721 --> 00:13:49,859
I'll see what I can do.

276
00:13:50,806 --> 00:13:51,682
Thanks.

277
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,289
You're welcome.

278
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,174
Thank you.

279
00:14:00,502 --> 00:14:04,615
The right hemidiaphragm is so high that it's completely displacing her lung tissue.

280
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:07,031
It's infiltrated her spinal canal in three places.

281
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,485
We should start there.

282
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:12,003
It's gonna take three or four hours just to get around those nerves.

283
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,419
I'd prefer to start in front and then flip her.

284
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:16,467
You never know what kind of vessels are involved.

285
00:14:16,581 --> 00:14:19,367
I'm gonna need a good head start.

286
00:14:19,462 --> 00:14:22,760
If I miss a step, she's paralyzed.

287
00:14:22,857 --> 00:14:26,826
If I don't relieve the pressure on her lungs, she'll be dead, so she won't mind if she can't walk.

288
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,104
Do you think she really wants to live?

289
00:14:29,749 --> 00:14:32,310
Come on. She's been housebound.

290
00:14:32,391 --> 00:14:36,477
She's been living under this thing, just watching it grow for how long?

291
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:40,076
She doesn't seem stupid -- doesn't even seem all that scared.

292
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:42,902
Why would anyone wait this long unless they wanted to die?

293
00:14:42,984 --> 00:14:45,309
People do things every day that they know could kill them --

294
00:14:45,979 --> 00:14:47,332
doesn't mean they want to die.

295
00:14:47,422 --> 00:14:49,389
Well, what are her chances of surviving the surgery?

296
00:14:49,512 --> 00:14:51,320
Slightly better than if we do nothing.

297
00:14:51,755 --> 00:14:53,020
So is it worth it?

298
00:14:54,397 --> 00:14:57,520
Hey, come on. You were already thinking it. I'm just saying.

299
00:14:58,903 --> 00:15:00,915
She's 43. It's worth a try.

300
00:15:06,858 --> 00:15:07,607
Morning.

301
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,852
Dr. Shepherd...

302
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:18,119
Mr. Levangie, the parkinson's patient --

303
00:15:18,272 --> 00:15:20,099
is he a good candidate for DBS?

304
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,275
Yes, but he's not interested.

305
00:15:22,557 --> 00:15:25,734
Okay, but I think it's worth talking to him again, pushing him.

306
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,308
We're talking about a brain surgery

307
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,398
that is performed while the patient is wide awake.

308
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,279
There is a risk of paralysis, a risk of death, and the patient doesn't want it.

309
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,112
It is not my job to push him into anything, and it's definitely not yours.

310
00:15:37,997 --> 00:15:41,752
Since you're uncomfortable with my decision in this, it's probably best you don't scrub in.

311
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:44,051
It's a minor procedure. You won't be missed.

312
00:15:53,576 --> 00:15:55,106
You know, they call you the nazi.

313
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:56,662
So I've heard.

314
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,025
I won't lie to you.

315
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:06,758
The surgery is going to be long and difficult,

316
00:16:06,856 --> 00:16:09,740
but we have an extremely capable surgical team, and I can --

317
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,338
Am I gonna die?

318
00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:15,012
There's always that risk,

319
00:16:15,478 --> 00:16:16,948
but if we don't do the surgery...

320
00:16:18,335 --> 00:16:19,620
I'll definitely die.

321
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:20,824
Yes.

322
00:16:21,504 --> 00:16:22,400
Soon?

323
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:23,579
Yes.

324
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:29,205
- Mom, the room's clean.
- Okay, honey, okay.

325
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:29,988
Mom!

326
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:32,138
She'll have the surgery.

327
00:16:32,384 --> 00:16:33,112
Mom.

328
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,370
No. No, Annie.

329
00:16:36,123 --> 00:16:37,766
She will have the surgery.

330
00:16:42,717 --> 00:16:44,290
I guess I'll have the surgery...

331
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:46,956
I think that is a very wise decision.

332
00:16:47,032 --> 00:16:49,797
On one condition -- I don't want him there.

333
00:16:51,723 --> 00:16:54,703
I'm sorry, Annie. Did I upset you in some way?

334
00:16:54,774 --> 00:16:57,084
If he's in the surgery, I'm not having it.

335
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:02,317
That's how I live with myself.

336
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,230
Okay, Ms. Connors.

337
00:17:06,618 --> 00:17:07,626
Dr. Karev.

338
00:17:15,922 --> 00:17:16,975
What the hell did you do?

339
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:19,008
Nothing. I don't know.

340
00:17:19,145 --> 00:17:21,084
Man. The mike must have been on.

341
00:17:21,136 --> 00:17:23,391
If anything goes wrong, anything, 

342
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,391
you are 60% more likely to be sued if you've offended the patient --

343
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,735
- 60%.
- I never would have said that stuff.

344
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:31,833
The mike shouldn't have been on. I didn't realize she could hear me.

345
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:34,281
Now you won't realize your chance to scrub in.

346
00:17:34,342 --> 00:17:37,379
You're banned from the O.R. -- mine or anyone else's -- all week.

347
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,676
I got the history on the tumor. It's been growing for a year and a half.

348
00:17:40,907 --> 00:17:43,436
A year and a half, and it's the first time she's even had it looked at.

349
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:44,925
It's like she's fatally lazy.

350
00:17:49,144 --> 00:17:51,188
Why doesn't she get banned?

351
00:17:52,436 --> 00:17:55,422
Go prep Annie Connors for surgery. You're scrubbing in with Cristina.

352
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:56,931
Really? I mean, thank you.

353
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,677
Okay.

354
00:17:59,323 --> 00:18:03,336
We just need to recheck your labs and get an EKG, so I just need to take a little blood.

355
00:18:04,253 --> 00:18:05,543
Dr. Burke is great

356
00:18:05,745 --> 00:18:06,803
and Dr. Bailey.

357
00:18:07,244 --> 00:18:08,467
I know you're probably scared.

358
00:18:08,544 --> 00:18:09,599
That's okay, kitten.

359
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:11,217
You can just do your job.

360
00:18:11,402 --> 00:18:14,044
You don't have to talk to the fat, nasty tumor lady.

361
00:18:14,274 --> 00:18:17,264
I mean, I let it get this bad. How much sympathy do I deserve?

362
00:18:19,486 --> 00:18:21,237
Why did you let it get this bad?

363
00:18:23,782 --> 00:18:26,301
You're the first person since I got here to ask me that.

364
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:29,250
Well, I guess it's just like the elephant in the room.

365
00:18:29,368 --> 00:18:34,134
Elephant? It's more like a giant sow, don't you think?

366
00:18:40,873 --> 00:18:43,339
Every time I went to the hospital, someone died --

367
00:18:44,466 --> 00:18:46,199
all four of my grandparents,

368
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:47,472
then my dad,

369
00:18:48,312 --> 00:18:49,490
my best friend's mom,

370
00:18:50,446 --> 00:18:51,665
my baby sister.

371
00:18:52,326 --> 00:18:55,214
They all went in -- never came out.

372
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:57,856
So I put it off.

373
00:19:01,563 --> 00:19:04,123
You know, you're not the only one... to put things off.

374
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,611
I mean, I never do anything till the last possible minute.

375
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:07,974
Like what?

376
00:19:08,485 --> 00:19:09,175
Well...

377
00:19:11,824 --> 00:19:15,090
I've had this thing for my roommate since, like, day one, and I just --

378
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:18,304
I... can't tell her.

379
00:19:18,428 --> 00:19:20,615
She probably wouldn't go out with me, anyway, but...

380
00:19:21,122 --> 00:19:25,909
how  do I know that for sure if I... don't ever ask?

381
00:19:27,629 --> 00:19:32,753
Seriously? You're equating your pathetic love life with my record-breaking tumor?

382
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:35,064
Seriously?

383
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,754
It's just that he blatantly favors me in front of her,

384
00:19:41,868 --> 00:19:43,736
and then blatantly dismisses me.

385
00:19:43,803 --> 00:19:45,180
How do you know he was favoring you?

386
00:19:47,557 --> 00:19:49,850
Look, you've got a brain. You got into this program.

387
00:19:49,942 --> 00:19:51,780
Just because shepherd munched your cookies

388
00:19:51,846 --> 00:19:53,710
doesn't mean that you didn't deserve what you worked for.

389
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,225
But he's making me look bad.

390
00:19:56,592 --> 00:19:57,693
I have to end it.

391
00:19:58,082 --> 00:19:58,937
Right.

392
00:19:59,158 --> 00:19:59,911
It's over.

393
00:20:01,006 --> 00:20:03,525
Is it true you get to scrub in on that tumor?

394
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:04,508
Don't sit here.

395
00:20:04,596 --> 00:20:05,675
You get to scrub in?

396
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:07,279
How psyched are you?

397
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:09,726
On a scale of one to ecstatic, ecstatic.

398
00:20:09,804 --> 00:20:11,702
That's unbelievable. You know what I think?

399
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:13,954
I think Burke wants to get into your scrubs.

400
00:20:14,016 --> 00:20:15,154
Why are you sitting here?

401
00:20:15,306 --> 00:20:18,260
He kicked me off that surgery for the same crap you pull every day.

402
00:20:18,363 --> 00:20:21,629
If I stuck this fork into his thigh, would I get in trouble?

403
00:20:21,711 --> 00:20:23,437
Not if you make it look like an accident.

404
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:24,402
Hey.

405
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,205
Thank god, man.

406
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:28,988
I'm drowning in estrogen here.

407
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:31,998
Look, is everything okay?

408
00:20:33,385 --> 00:20:34,916
Shepherd's a jackass.

409
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:36,949
Really? I think he's kind of great.

410
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,381
He reamed her out in front of Bailey.

411
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:40,196
Why?

412
00:20:40,374 --> 00:20:41,578
'Cause he's a jackass.

413
00:20:43,462 --> 00:20:46,232
Well, bad days are... bad.

414
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:51,449
Maybe tonight, uh, if, you know, if you drink alcohol, I mean,

415
00:20:51,515 --> 00:20:55,602
we could -- all of us, I mean, go out and drink alcohol...

416
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:59,099
because of the bad day.

417
00:21:03,352 --> 00:21:04,311
I got to go.

418
00:21:08,904 --> 00:21:09,703
Dude.

419
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,207
Shut up.

420
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:26,435
- How's your back?
- Still good.

421
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:30,180
Can you lean forward for me? I just want to check something.

422
00:21:30,842 --> 00:21:31,703
Does that feel okay?

423
00:21:32,303 --> 00:21:33,065
Right here?

424
00:21:33,695 --> 00:21:34,622
Did you page?

425
00:21:36,424 --> 00:21:38,831
Mr. Levangie, have you given any more thought

426
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:41,535
about the other surgical options we discussed this morning?

427
00:21:41,772 --> 00:21:42,517
What?

428
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:46,976
Why would I? I already told you no.

429
00:21:47,425 --> 00:21:50,245
I'm letting you cut into my back,

430
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:52,409
but that's not enough for you.

431
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:54,753
All you guys ever want to do is cut.

432
00:21:54,845 --> 00:21:56,232
Dad, just listen to what he has to say.

433
00:21:56,325 --> 00:21:57,943
I already listened.

434
00:21:58,378 --> 00:22:01,738
Sir, there's a very small window of opportunity here.

435
00:22:01,906 --> 00:22:04,373
Once the parkinson's progresses to a point of dementia,

436
00:22:04,451 --> 00:22:07,005
you're no longer a candidate for DBS.

437
00:22:07,114 --> 00:22:09,689
And when I'm no longer a candidate,

438
00:22:09,965 --> 00:22:14,097
is that when you people will leave me the hell alone?!

439
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,253
What? Do I have to start drooling

440
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,634
and forget my name to get a little peace and quiet?

441
00:22:22,124 --> 00:22:22,918
All right.

442
00:22:23,887 --> 00:22:25,228
I'll check back with you later.

443
00:22:25,335 --> 00:22:26,369
Try to get some rest.

444
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:30,092
Dad, you're being unreasonable.

445
00:22:30,512 --> 00:22:32,407
The doctors are only trying to help you.

446
00:22:32,487 --> 00:22:35,141
It's my damn life, and it's my damn brain.

447
00:22:35,331 --> 00:22:39,990
You want me to let them cut up my brain while I'm lying here awake -- for what?

448
00:22:40,086 --> 00:22:42,432
- Dad!
- I'll be at your wedding.

449
00:22:43,006 --> 00:22:47,014
I will sit in the back. Your uncle will walk you down the aisle.

450
00:22:47,668 --> 00:22:50,751
I know it's not perfect, but it's life.

451
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:52,907
Life is messy sometimes.

452
00:22:54,351 --> 00:22:55,575
I know that.

453
00:23:00,418 --> 00:23:01,764
If she knows...

454
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:05,841
then what the hell are we still talking for, huh?

455
00:23:06,528 --> 00:23:09,154
Why in hell can't she drop it?

456
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:14,012
It is your life.

457
00:23:14,658 --> 00:23:16,126
But it's her life, too.

458
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,752
And you have a chance to get better here.

459
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:21,517
And all she's asking you to do is try.

460
00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:34,160
If they pull this off, I'm totally calling Oprah.

461
00:23:34,922 --> 00:23:36,468
You two been working out?

462
00:23:37,794 --> 00:23:42,008
Sometimes I jog, and I try to take the stairs whenever possible.

463
00:23:42,084 --> 00:23:42,822
Why?

464
00:23:43,202 --> 00:23:45,101
See that large pile of tumor?

465
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:48,336
You're gonna be retracting it for the next 14 hours,

466
00:23:48,434 --> 00:23:51,219
so I'm just saying I hope you have strong backs.

467
00:23:54,394 --> 00:23:55,387
Dr. Shepherd.

468
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,764
Yes?

469
00:23:57,384 --> 00:23:59,956
Mr. Levangie has agreed to DBS...

470
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,685
if we do it today.

471
00:24:03,082 --> 00:24:04,829
If he leaves, he won't come back.

472
00:24:09,098 --> 00:24:10,605
Don't worry, Dr. Shepherd.

473
00:24:11,295 --> 00:24:13,542
It'll take hours before we get around to the spine.

474
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,833
I'll page you.

475
00:24:16,636 --> 00:24:17,577
All right, then.

476
00:24:20,905 --> 00:24:21,705
Let's do it.

477
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:29,195
Dr. Bailey...

478
00:24:31,688 --> 00:24:32,885
I didn't know...

479
00:24:34,402 --> 00:24:36,465
that he was my boss when I met him.

480
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:37,351
I didn't know.

481
00:24:37,428 --> 00:24:38,355
I don't care.

482
00:24:38,584 --> 00:24:39,489
Really?

483
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:43,070
Oh, well, you sort of seemed to not be talking to me, so I --

484
00:24:43,162 --> 00:24:45,317
You see this -- what's happening right here?

485
00:24:45,415 --> 00:24:48,569
This is the problem with you sleeping with my boss --

486
00:24:48,758 --> 00:24:53,418
not whether or not you knew him before, but how it affects my day.

487
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:58,204
And me standing here talking to you about your sex life affects my day.

488
00:24:58,353 --> 00:25:01,135
And the longer this little fling goes on,

489
00:25:01,241 --> 00:25:04,077
the more favors you get over the others,

490
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:07,912
who are fighting tooth and nail just to make it through this program without any assistance --

491
00:25:07,968 --> 00:25:10,922
when those people start finding out what's going on

492
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:14,773
and they don't want to work with you and talk to you

493
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:18,193
or look at you and they start bitching and moaning at me,

494
00:25:19,007 --> 00:25:21,557
the more it affects my day.

495
00:25:22,094 --> 00:25:23,820
So, no, Dr. Grey,

496
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:26,670
I don't care what you knew or when you knew it.

497
00:25:27,271 --> 00:25:28,357
Are we understood?

498
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:31,126
- Yes.
- Good.

499
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:41,166
This sucks.

500
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,271
Yeah, well, I'm not a real fan of yours, either.

501
00:25:43,337 --> 00:25:45,764
Not you -- this -- everyone else is scrubbed in somewhere.

502
00:25:45,928 --> 00:25:47,603
Bright side -- we have the run of the floor.

503
00:25:47,695 --> 00:25:49,329
Want to do it in the stairwell?

504
00:25:49,456 --> 00:25:51,058
I'm just saying you never know what could happen.

505
00:25:55,006 --> 00:25:56,261
I'm changing.

506
00:25:56,515 --> 00:25:57,627
I'll page you if I need you.

507
00:25:57,909 --> 00:25:58,836
You do that.

508
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,269
You are so my favorite person today.

509
00:26:08,528 --> 00:26:10,198
We need to hang another bag of O-neg.

510
00:26:11,066 --> 00:26:15,241
Cauterizing the small bleeders to keep my visual field clean.

511
00:26:15,743 --> 00:26:17,268
God, is your back killing you?

512
00:26:17,391 --> 00:26:19,127
George, shut up. We're in here.

513
00:26:19,337 --> 00:26:20,043
More suction, please.

514
00:26:26,005 --> 00:26:28,932
Mrs. Harper, let me show you these chest films.

515
00:26:31,286 --> 00:26:33,476
We were able to relieve the obstruction of his chest tube,

516
00:26:33,536 --> 00:26:36,177
so the buildup of fluid you see here should resolve itself soon.

517
00:26:39,714 --> 00:26:42,038
Which translates as he should be home in no time.

518
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,077
He was making waffles.

519
00:26:44,184 --> 00:26:44,896
I'm sorry?

520
00:26:45,275 --> 00:26:46,508
He was making waffles.

521
00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:48,704
He was mixing the batter, and --

522
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,185
and then, he was on the floor.

523
00:26:50,307 --> 00:26:52,367
Izzie, we need a central line run in 204.

524
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:54,225
- Page Dr. Karev, will you?
- He's not answering.

525
00:26:55,161 --> 00:26:56,216
I'm so sorry.

526
00:26:56,758 --> 00:26:57,906
I'll be back.

527
00:27:09,146 --> 00:27:10,604
Like what you see, right?

528
00:27:17,695 --> 00:27:18,658
Neuro sponge.

529
00:27:20,737 --> 00:27:22,073
How you doing, Mr. Levangie?

530
00:27:22,283 --> 00:27:23,066
All right.

531
00:27:24,782 --> 00:27:26,282
Where's blondie?

532
00:27:26,414 --> 00:27:27,316
I'm right here.

533
00:27:27,404 --> 00:27:28,530
Can't you see me?

534
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,459
I'm shaky. I'm not blind.

535
00:27:31,094 --> 00:27:33,772
Anything goes wrong here, I'm blaming you.

536
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:37,085
Okay, in that case, I'll stay where you can see me.

537
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:42,338
We just have to drill a hole and try to find the spot that controls the motor function.

538
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,539
You can't see my brain from there.

539
00:27:44,661 --> 00:27:46,813
Aren't you supposed to be learning something?

540
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:48,476
I'm good right here.

541
00:27:51,764 --> 00:27:54,539
Okay, Mr. Levangie, just take a couple deep breaths.

542
00:27:54,621 --> 00:27:55,927
Focus on the pretty girl.

543
00:27:57,401 --> 00:28:00,493
Okay, this is gonna sound really scary, but try and relax.

544
00:28:00,627 --> 00:28:01,978
You shouldn't feel a thing.

545
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,820
- Any pain here?
- No.

546
00:28:05,138 --> 00:28:05,803
Here?

547
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,616
Okay.

548
00:28:07,831 --> 00:28:10,498
Dr. Stevens, I need you to check the x-ray in 2103.

549
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:15,337
2118 needs post-op notes, and jane's wondering if you want her to start feeding 2112.

550
00:28:15,634 --> 00:28:16,551
I'm going on break.

551
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:19,684
Okay, yeah, before you do that, could you page Dr. Karev again?

552
00:28:19,776 --> 00:28:20,990
- I already paged him.
- Yeah, again?

553
00:28:26,111 --> 00:28:28,272
- How is it?
- Long and slow.

554
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,781
I don't envy those two.

555
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,049
They've been holding that thing for eight hours.

556
00:28:32,228 --> 00:28:34,301
Their arms have to be ready to fall off.

557
00:28:37,407 --> 00:28:39,218
Look at the size of this artery.

558
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:40,679
My god.

559
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,770
It's as thick as a thumb.

560
00:28:43,984 --> 00:28:46,047
You ever seen a vessel this size?

561
00:28:46,467 --> 00:28:47,373
No.

562
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:51,096
This thing's just feeding on all her blood.

563
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:53,584
We need more O-negative.

564
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:55,515
I'll call the blood bank.

565
00:28:59,007 --> 00:29:00,042
Damn it, O'Malley.

566
00:29:00,593 --> 00:29:01,947
Do you want me to kill this patient?!

567
00:29:02,012 --> 00:29:03,000
No, I -- sorry.

568
00:29:03,582 --> 00:29:05,925
I mean, is the art of retracting just too much for you?

569
00:29:06,002 --> 00:29:07,834
No, I was, uh -- um...

570
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:11,535
I had an itch.

571
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,402
Way to go, George.

572
00:29:15,585 --> 00:29:16,553
Nicely done.

573
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,603
Just keep trying, Mr. Levangie.

574
00:29:20,746 --> 00:29:21,996
Mimic my motions.

575
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:23,445
You can do it.

576
00:29:24,622 --> 00:29:26,721
You're doing great, Mr. Levangie.

577
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,274
Just a little longer.

578
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,605
Oh, damn it!

579
00:29:32,002 --> 00:29:33,757
Take a breath and try again.

580
00:29:34,084 --> 00:29:35,744
One more time, Mr. Levangie.

581
00:29:36,886 --> 00:29:38,288
The probe is almost in.

582
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,900
You'll know it when we find the right spot.

583
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:54,288
Well, how about that?

584
00:29:54,432 --> 00:29:55,246
There it is.

585
00:29:56,618 --> 00:29:58,215
I'll be a son of a bitch.

586
00:30:07,971 --> 00:30:10,571
I was trying to protect you.

587
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,253
You trying to protect me is why she's on the warpath.

588
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,820
You can't do me favors.

589
00:30:14,989 --> 00:30:16,996
You can't ask me to scrub in when I haven't earned it.

590
00:30:17,068 --> 00:30:18,096
Okay. Oaky.

591
00:30:18,173 --> 00:30:20,764
And you can't treat me like crap when I haven't earned that.

592
00:30:20,867 --> 00:30:22,545
I can take care of myself.

593
00:30:22,725 --> 00:30:24,680
I got myself into this mess, and I...

594
00:30:25,317 --> 00:30:26,652
And you'll get yourself out?

595
00:30:26,887 --> 00:30:29,683
I don't... know that yet.

596
00:30:34,623 --> 00:30:35,885
Don't let me keep you.

597
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,230
You did great work here today.

598
00:30:40,414 --> 00:30:41,505
Dr. Shepherd.

599
00:30:41,818 --> 00:30:42,627
Yeah?

600
00:30:43,618 --> 00:30:45,740
Sorry I called you a jackass.

601
00:30:45,924 --> 00:30:46,748
You didn't.

602
00:30:47,034 --> 00:30:49,165
I did... twice.

603
00:30:52,006 --> 00:30:53,471
Tell you what, blondie,

604
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:56,164
if you don't marry him, I will.

605
00:31:11,742 --> 00:31:14,157
No, no, no, Jimmy!

606
00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:15,963
No, no, Jimmy, no!

607
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,681
What we got?

608
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:20,188
Pressure plummeted to 64/22, and he has runs of v-tach that aren't perfusing.

609
00:31:20,244 --> 00:31:21,519
Cvp is sky-high.

610
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,199
Give him dopamine -- 10 mikes.

611
00:31:23,264 --> 00:31:24,196
He's already maxed out.

612
00:31:24,263 --> 00:31:26,214
The resident was here an hour ago, but I can't reach him now.

613
00:31:26,281 --> 00:31:29,516
- Of course.
- What is the matter with you?!

614
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:30,484
Get her out of here!

615
00:31:30,571 --> 00:31:32,618
Mrs. Harper, you have to get out of here.

616
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:36,265
Does he have a myocardial ischemia?

617
00:31:36,346 --> 00:31:37,851
No, it's a clot -- big one.

618
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:39,120
Page someone. Page anyone.

619
00:31:39,194 --> 00:31:41,204
He'll be dead before they get here.

620
00:31:41,292 --> 00:31:44,236
You have to do sOmething. Do anything, please!

621
00:31:44,328 --> 00:31:47,181
- You said he was okay!
- Get out of here now!

622
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:48,460
You have to cut.

623
00:31:49,043 --> 00:31:51,814
I can't. I've never even seen it done. I could kill him.

624
00:31:51,897 --> 00:31:53,083
Do nothing, you'll kill him faster.

625
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,686
- What's your glove size?
- 6.

626
00:31:54,988 --> 00:31:56,831
Oh, god. Oh, god.

627
00:31:56,908 --> 00:31:58,562
Take a breath, Dr. Stevens.

628
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:00,108
She has to move over there.

629
00:32:00,313 --> 00:32:01,451
Walter, move out of the way.

630
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,846
Cut the stitches and then the staples.

631
00:32:08,249 --> 00:32:09,965
Don't let them fall into the chest cavity.

632
00:32:10,092 --> 00:32:12,550
Wait. I've never cracked a chest before.

633
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:14,500
Oh, god. Oh, god.

634
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,559
No pulse. Wide complex rhythm.

635
00:32:19,665 --> 00:32:21,700
I can't get this clot out. I need more suction. I need more.

636
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:23,446
He's bradying down.

637
00:32:23,717 --> 00:32:25,484
You have to get the clot out.

638
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,397
I can't get it.

639
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:29,785
Screw it.

640
00:32:29,858 --> 00:32:30,885
I'm using my hand.

641
00:32:34,439 --> 00:32:36,681
Oh, god, look at the size of that clot.

642
00:32:38,078 --> 00:32:38,811
Anything?

643
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:39,687
No.

644
00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:42,344
You have to massage the heart, doctor.

645
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,750
Come on.

646
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,592
Come on, please.

647
00:32:55,021 --> 00:32:56,317
Come on, Mr. Harper.

648
00:32:57,396 --> 00:32:59,127
We have a pulse.

649
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:10,282
Okay, more suction.

650
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:11,400
How's it going?

651
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:14,783
It's more intertwined than the studies made it look.

652
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,049
I need another bag.

653
00:33:16,535 --> 00:33:18,855
Call the blood bank. We need more O-negative.

654
00:33:19,358 --> 00:33:22,388
I'm down 10 units of blood, and I haven't even flipped her yet.

655
00:33:22,592 --> 00:33:23,479
Oh, wow.

656
00:33:25,143 --> 00:33:26,319
Hold it steady.

657
00:33:26,976 --> 00:33:27,862
Look at that.

658
00:33:28,327 --> 00:33:29,008
Sponge.

659
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,509
Now, how am I supposed to get around that artery?

660
00:33:38,511 --> 00:33:39,852
All right, then.

661
00:33:40,273 --> 00:33:41,031
Forceps.

662
00:33:43,241 --> 00:33:43,953
Here you go.

663
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:46,431
Excuse me.

664
00:33:47,733 --> 00:33:49,390
God, it's unbelievable.

665
00:33:49,605 --> 00:33:50,332
Right.

666
00:33:51,054 --> 00:33:52,877
How did she live like that?

667
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:55,795
Watch what you say. You never know who's listening.

668
00:33:58,317 --> 00:33:59,277
Look at George.

669
00:33:59,391 --> 00:34:00,935
He looks like he's about to fall in.

670
00:34:03,425 --> 00:34:06,241
Are you really as shallow and callous as you seem?

671
00:34:06,471 --> 00:34:11,242
Oh, you want to go out for a drink later and hear about my secret pain?

672
00:34:11,545 --> 00:34:13,475
Does that line ever work for you?

673
00:34:13,614 --> 00:34:14,479
Sometimes.

674
00:34:16,558 --> 00:34:18,748
Must be because you look like that.

675
00:34:19,154 --> 00:34:20,008
Like what?

676
00:34:22,656 --> 00:34:23,995
So, is that a yes?

677
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,415
No.

678
00:34:26,453 --> 00:34:28,537
I can't. I'm seeing someone.

679
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,784
Look, if you don't want to go out with me, just say so --

680
00:34:32,097 --> 00:34:33,356
no need to lie.

681
00:34:34,216 --> 00:34:35,752
Oh, okay.

682
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:37,881
Well, I don't want to go out with you.

683
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:42,168
But I think I really might be seeing someone.

684
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,862
No, it's up here. It's up here.

685
00:34:46,553 --> 00:34:48,535
We're still in the middle of surgery.

686
00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:51,691
Mr. Harper, the post-op heart patient in 2114 --

687
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,836
I had to open his sternotomy bedside.

688
00:34:54,707 --> 00:34:56,034
- You what?
- What?

689
00:34:56,365 --> 00:34:57,123
What?

690
00:34:57,517 --> 00:34:59,491
He had cardiac tamponade.

691
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:02,720
His chest films were clean this morning. It happened fast.

692
00:35:02,782 --> 00:35:04,553
He was in P.E.A. There was no time.

693
00:35:06,616 --> 00:35:07,706
Go ahead. I got it.

694
00:35:09,043 --> 00:35:09,986
We're okay here.

695
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,125
Yeah, I need some retraction.

696
00:35:12,203 --> 00:35:13,461
- Pull back on the retractor.
- I got it.

697
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,548
You opened a heart bedside, and you couldn't even page me?

698
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:19,707
Needed all the glory for yourself, right?

699
00:35:19,794 --> 00:35:23,624
I paged you 50 times. Do you have any idea what I have been through?

700
00:35:24,925 --> 00:35:25,903
Oh, man.

701
00:35:26,594 --> 00:35:28,091
The battery -- I forgot to change it.

702
00:35:28,197 --> 00:35:29,195
You forgot?

703
00:35:29,635 --> 00:35:31,679
You forgot?! You are hateful!

704
00:35:31,771 --> 00:35:36,297
You are a hateful, lazy, arrogant, hateful man!

705
00:35:37,244 --> 00:35:38,197
Hateful!

706
00:35:38,515 --> 00:35:40,740
Never a dull moment here at seattle grace.

707
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:42,769
Oh, my god.

708
00:35:42,927 --> 00:35:44,217
Get right in there. Get it.

709
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:46,389
She can't afford to lose this much blood.

710
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:49,205
Get me some suction here. I can't see what I'm doing.

711
00:35:49,308 --> 00:35:50,869
Clamp, clamp, clamp, please.

712
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:56,153
- Is there any blood in the rapid infuser? 
- We're waiting on two units.

713
00:35:56,229 --> 00:35:57,094
What do you mean you're waiting?

714
00:35:57,181 --> 00:35:59,183
We didn't anticipate this much blood loss.

715
00:35:59,307 --> 00:36:01,830
We prepped a double supply. We've used it all.

716
00:36:01,917 --> 00:36:03,078
- What did you cut?
- Nothing.

717
00:36:03,235 --> 00:36:04,380
It just blew.

718
00:36:04,482 --> 00:36:06,474
She came in with too much damage.

719
00:36:06,603 --> 00:36:09,050
- The artery walls are too weak.
- Take care of it.

720
00:36:09,249 --> 00:36:11,502
- Annie, come on.
- ...10 units of O-negative.

721
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,169
I cannot see -- what's this? George, give me your hand.

722
00:36:14,246 --> 00:36:17,076
Push right down here. Pull. Suction, suction!

723
00:36:17,162 --> 00:36:18,072
The pressure's dropping.

724
00:36:18,189 --> 00:36:20,039
She needs blood. Where the hell is the blood?!

725
00:36:24,831 --> 00:36:27,057
Somebody grab that. Push it back, George. Come on.

726
00:36:29,817 --> 00:36:32,883
Oh, god. Just squeeze it off right there.

727
00:36:33,473 --> 00:36:34,251
Here we go.

728
00:36:40,223 --> 00:36:41,664
Is that O-negative for O.R. 1?

729
00:36:41,864 --> 00:36:43,570
- Uh-huh, O.R. 1.
- O.R. 1, right?

730
00:36:43,692 --> 00:36:44,951
- I got it!
- I got it!

731
00:36:48,568 --> 00:36:50,149
Some suction, please, in here, now.

732
00:36:52,029 --> 00:36:53,589
We're losing her now. Look at this.

733
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:54,787
Come on.

734
00:37:10,752 --> 00:37:11,831
Oh, come on!

735
00:37:12,308 --> 00:37:13,015
Come on!

736
00:37:42,972 --> 00:37:45,824
Time of death is 11:42.

737
00:38:02,445 --> 00:38:03,227
I got it!

738
00:38:26,503 --> 00:38:28,617
The early bird catches the worm.

739
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:32,275
A stitch in time saves nine.

740
00:38:34,072 --> 00:38:34,778
Messy.

741
00:38:35,474 --> 00:38:36,092
I'm sorry.

742
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:37,489
Don't be.

743
00:38:37,921 --> 00:38:39,231
You saved his life.

744
00:38:48,202 --> 00:38:50,624
He who hesitates is lost.

745
00:39:03,613 --> 00:39:06,419
We can't pretend we haven't been told.

746
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,799
We've all heard the proverbs,

747
00:39:09,154 --> 00:39:10,561
heard the philosophers,

748
00:39:11,211 --> 00:39:14,483
heard our grandparents warning us about wasted time,

749
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:18,599
heard the damn poets urging us to seize the day.

750
00:39:21,047 --> 00:39:23,182
Still, sometimes,

751
00:39:23,682 --> 00:39:25,552
we have to see for ourselves.

752
00:39:39,093 --> 00:39:41,086
I'm not doing you any more favors.

753
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,571
This was it.

754
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:46,877
I've been holding 50 pounds of tumor for the past 12 hours.

755
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,959
My back's gonna need traction, and the patient died anyways.

756
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:52,397
And you think you did me a favor?

757
00:39:53,549 --> 00:39:54,737
Look, I'm just...

758
00:39:56,836 --> 00:39:57,829
What is this...

759
00:39:58,999 --> 00:40:01,171
that we're doing here?

760
00:40:02,478 --> 00:40:03,312
What is it?

761
00:40:07,265 --> 00:40:08,899
You need a definition?

762
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,720
You really want to be that guy?

763
00:40:15,882 --> 00:40:18,232
We have to make our own mistakes.

764
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:20,955
Lock the door.

765
00:40:24,448 --> 00:40:26,681
We have to learn our own lessons.

766
00:40:26,961 --> 00:40:28,461
Have you seen Meredith?

767
00:40:29,482 --> 00:40:32,317
Save yourself the misery, man. She's off the market.

768
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,028
What?

769
00:40:33,193 --> 00:40:34,882
No, that's not -- we're just friends.

770
00:40:35,727 --> 00:40:36,511
Whatever.

771
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,207
But she's not. I mean, if she was seeing someone -- I live with her -- I would know it.

772
00:40:50,494 --> 00:40:56,509
We have to sweep today's possibility under tomorrow's rug until we can't anymore,

773
00:40:56,591 --> 00:41:01,844
until we finally understand for ourselves what Benjamin Franklin meant...

774
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:07,221
...that knowing is better than wondering...

775
00:41:12,412 --> 00:41:15,223
...that waking is better than sleeping...

776
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:22,566
I, um, know this place

777
00:41:23,323 --> 00:41:28,576
where there's an amazing view of sunrise over the ferryboats.

778
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:33,661
I have a thing for ferryboats.

779
00:41:34,803 --> 00:41:35,949
I remember.

780
00:41:48,043 --> 00:41:50,183
...and that even the biggest failure,

781
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,860
even the worst, most intractable mistake

782
00:41:54,115 --> 00:41:56,353
beats the hell out of never trying.

783
00:41:57,663 --> 00:42:02,503
