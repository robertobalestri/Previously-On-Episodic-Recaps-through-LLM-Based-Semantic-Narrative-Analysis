1
00:00:01,231 --> 00:00:03,241
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:03,493 --> 00:00:04,984
We had sex - once.

3
00:00:05,065 --> 00:00:05,900
Go out with me.

4
00:00:06,026 --> 00:00:07,154
You know you're my boss.

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,367
You know it's against the rules.

6
00:00:08,424 --> 00:00:10,322
Do you like Izzie? Is that what this is about?

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,566
Izzie? No. She's not the one I'm attracted to.

8
00:00:12,603 --> 00:00:14,164
Not the one. So there's a one.

9
00:00:14,235 --> 00:00:16,625
Haven't you ever been attracted
to someone you couldn't have?

10
00:00:17,253 --> 00:00:18,054
Meredith.

11
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,898
Just coffee.

12
00:00:20,408 --> 00:00:21,032
Good.

13
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:21,761
Okay.

14
00:00:21,873 --> 00:00:22,442
Okay.

15
00:00:22,508 --> 00:00:24,418
But your mother's alzheimer's is advancing.

16
00:00:24,495 --> 00:00:26,619
So while she's still lucid enough to consent,

17
00:00:26,677 --> 00:00:28,529
she needs to sign everything over to you.

18
00:00:28,632 --> 00:00:29,251
Me?

19
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,976
Thanks for the coffee.

20
00:00:35,976 --> 00:00:37,875
So, you blew me off for a bottle of tequila.

21
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:39,886
That's not nearly as much fun to wake up to.

22
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,107
You mind moving this tail wagon?

23
00:00:43,184 --> 00:00:44,474
You're blocking me in.

24
00:00:47,664 --> 00:00:49,272
A couple hundred years ago,

25
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:53,383
Benjamin Franklin shared with the
world the secret of his success -

26
00:00:53,823 --> 00:00:58,685
"never leave that till tomorrow,"
he said, "what you can do today."

27
00:01:05,186 --> 00:01:07,392
This is the man who discovered electricity.

28
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:10,504
You'd think more of us would
listen to what he had to say.

29
00:01:15,745 --> 00:01:18,262
I don't know why we put things off,

30
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,064
but if I had to guess,

31
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,930
I'd say it has a lot to do with fear -

32
00:01:25,354 --> 00:01:26,485
fear of failure,

33
00:01:27,012 --> 00:01:27,939
fear of pain,

34
00:01:28,727 --> 00:01:29,826
fear of rejection.

35
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:37,190
Wouldn't it be easier to just ask her out?

36
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:53,584
- She's gonna be late.
- Maybe not.

37
00:01:56,402 --> 00:01:58,371
- We should wait for her.
- Definitely not.

38
00:01:59,003 --> 00:02:02,631
I'm not her mother, and you are not
her boyfriend - not yet, anyway.

39
00:02:02,682 --> 00:02:04,874
Stop, okay? I told you I'm not interested.

40
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:06,906
Life is short, George.

41
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:09,568
Do you really want to die
before you ever ask her out?

42
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:11,598
I do not want to ask her out.

43
00:02:12,795 --> 00:02:14,301
Do you really want to die a liar?

44
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:15,088
I'm not -

45
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,033
I'm not dying.

46
00:02:19,245 --> 00:02:21,811
Sometimes, the fear is just
of making a decision...

47
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,214
because what if you're wrong?

48
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,677
What if you're making a mistake you can't undo?

49
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:31,053
Crap.

50
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:32,251
Crap?

51
00:02:32,589 --> 00:02:33,889
Hi. I'm late.

52
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:35,503
You're avoiding me.

53
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:37,289
Yes, but also late.

54
00:02:37,406 --> 00:02:39,267
Oh, are we gonna talk about this?

55
00:02:39,342 --> 00:02:39,982
No.

56
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,933
About us and Bailey and what she saw?

57
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:45,446
I don't need to talk about it.
I experienced it... naked.

58
00:02:45,696 --> 00:02:47,420
This is getting complicated.

59
00:02:47,498 --> 00:02:48,608
Complicated for me.

60
00:02:48,687 --> 00:02:50,458
I'm the intern sleeping with the attending.

61
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,562
Bailey isn't speaking to me anymore.

62
00:02:52,768 --> 00:02:54,143
Not that that's a bad thing.

63
00:02:54,838 --> 00:02:57,344
If I was a better guy, I'd walk away.

64
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,215
Yes, you would.

65
00:03:00,536 --> 00:03:01,948
Do you want me to be a better guy?

66
00:03:02,088 --> 00:03:03,007
Yes.

67
00:03:05,557 --> 00:03:06,278
No.

68
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,895
Crap.

69
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,737
I'm late.

70
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:12,756
Take your time.

71
00:03:14,202 --> 00:03:15,142
Think about it.

72
00:03:24,952 --> 00:03:25,704
Thanks.

73
00:03:29,401 --> 00:03:32,830
Is this a - should we talk about this?

74
00:03:34,813 --> 00:03:36,102
Yeah, definitely.

75
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:49,579
You're late.

76
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:50,711
So are you.

77
00:03:50,822 --> 00:03:53,185
I know, and I can't afford
to piss off Bailey any more.

78
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,515
Do you think she told anyone?

79
00:03:54,854 --> 00:03:55,776
About you and Mcdreamy?

80
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:56,931
- Yeah.
- No.

81
00:03:57,173 --> 00:03:58,318
He's her boss, too.

82
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,001
If they find out, what can they
- can they kick me out, or...

83
00:04:01,053 --> 00:04:01,919
No...

84
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:03,690
Not officially.

85
00:04:04,253 --> 00:04:08,159
You'll just get edged out, blacklisted,

86
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:09,885
banned from his surgeries,

87
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:12,240
passed over for chief resident.

88
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,752
It'll be humiliating, but you'll live.

89
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:17,167
I have to end it.

90
00:04:17,984 --> 00:04:20,038
I definitely have to end it.

91
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,485
I have to end it, right?

92
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:24,288
Meredith, shut up.

93
00:04:24,558 --> 00:04:25,348
What?

94
00:04:27,286 --> 00:04:29,225
Did you seriously just tell me to shut up?

95
00:04:29,272 --> 00:04:30,269
Oh, please.

96
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,438
You got a hot doctor who likes to
make you open up and say "ahh."

97
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:35,475
It's the american dream. Stop whining about it.

98
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:38,215
No. No good can come from sleeping with your boss.

99
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:39,382
Cristina, you're late.

100
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,616
So is Meredith.

101
00:04:41,057 --> 00:04:44,298
Whatever it is we're afraid
of, one thing holds true -

102
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:48,857
if, by the time the pain of not doing a
thing gets worse than the fear of doing it,

103
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,804
it can feel like we're
carrying around a giant tumor.

104
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,491
When we walk in this door,
you will maintain decorum.

105
00:04:54,554 --> 00:04:57,553
You will not laugh, vomit, or drop your jaw.

106
00:04:57,635 --> 00:04:58,582
Are we understood?

107
00:04:58,925 --> 00:04:59,899
Why would we laugh?

108
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:01,116
Oh, just you wait.

109
00:05:01,214 --> 00:05:03,031
Good morning, Miss Connors.

110
00:05:03,247 --> 00:05:03,969
Good morning.

111
00:05:06,955 --> 00:05:07,859
What is it?

112
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,210
Tumor.

113
00:05:11,316 --> 00:05:13,737
And you thought I was speaking metaphorically.

114
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:46,234
Good morning, Annie.

115
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,727
How are you? This is Dr. Bailey,
and these are my fellow interns.

116
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,076
Dr. Karev, we refer to patients as "mister" -

117
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,397
I told him to call me "Annie."

118
00:05:53,843 --> 00:05:56,977
"Ms. Connors" makes me feel old and fat,

119
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:59,777
which I am, but why feel that way?

120
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:01,672
Good morning.

121
00:06:01,948 --> 00:06:03,945
Oh, Annie, this is Dr. Burke -

122
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,266
awesome surgeon.

123
00:06:06,904 --> 00:06:08,046
Dr. Karev.

124
00:06:08,317 --> 00:06:12,173
Oh, Annie Connors is a 43-year-old
woman who presented last night

125
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,209
with progressive shortness of
breath for the past three months.

126
00:06:15,424 --> 00:06:21,327
Found to have a very large tumor of unknown
origin pressed against her diaphragm.

127
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:24,241
Stable vital signs. Scheduled for C.T.
this morning, sir.

128
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:25,603
Thank you, Dr. Karev.

129
00:06:26,574 --> 00:06:28,225
Are you at all claustrophobic?

130
00:06:28,307 --> 00:06:31,168
I've been housebound for the last year.
How claustrophobic could I be?

131
00:06:32,054 --> 00:06:32,944
All right, then.

132
00:06:33,323 --> 00:06:35,776
Dr. Stevens is going to take you up for a C.T.

133
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:39,289
It'll give us a better look at the tumor,
and we'll know how to proceed from there.

134
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:40,976
Could someone tell my mom?

135
00:06:41,245 --> 00:06:43,619
She'll worry if she gets back and I'm not here.

136
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:45,048
Yeah, of course. Of course.

137
00:06:45,182 --> 00:06:48,674
And would it be possible for
Alex to take me instead?

138
00:06:49,253 --> 00:06:52,981
I mean, he - he's just so fun to look at.

139
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,774
Annie.

140
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:56,610
Sure.

141
00:06:56,974 --> 00:06:58,023
Sure, Ms. Connors.

142
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,181
Excuse me.

143
00:07:02,646 --> 00:07:04,638
- How much do you think it weighs?
- 60 pounds.

144
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,128
More. She's carrying around a whole extra person.

145
00:07:07,238 --> 00:07:08,472
This one's going in the books.

146
00:07:08,577 --> 00:07:10,551
- I've got to get in.
- I almost did.

147
00:07:10,752 --> 00:07:13,337
Have you ever seen Alex like that?
He actually seemed sincere.

148
00:07:13,425 --> 00:07:14,803
"Seemed" being the operative word.

149
00:07:14,873 --> 00:07:16,388
He was on call when she came in.

150
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:18,165
I am never leaving this place again.

151
00:07:19,327 --> 00:07:20,418
Let's move, people.

152
00:07:20,715 --> 00:07:23,434
Ms. Connor's surgery, should we choose to proceed,

153
00:07:23,613 --> 00:07:26,070
will take most, if not all, of
the surgeons off the floor,

154
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:29,746
which means you people will have to
work extra hard not to kill anyone,

155
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:32,139
'cause we won't be there to fix your mistakes.

156
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:33,023
Dr. Burke.

157
00:07:37,078 --> 00:07:38,415
I really want in on this.

158
00:07:39,444 --> 00:07:40,616
I thought we weren't talking.

159
00:07:40,832 --> 00:07:42,352
I'm not talking. I'm just saying.

160
00:07:44,846 --> 00:07:48,291
Find her mother, get a family
history, and I'll tell Bailey.

161
00:07:50,859 --> 00:07:53,120
Mr. Harper had a coronary bypass yesterday.

162
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,726
His blood pressure, currently 100/65.

163
00:07:55,823 --> 00:08:00,657
It was running low overnight down to
70/30, but responded to medication.

164
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,969
Postoperative labs show a crit
of 30 and normal coagulation.

165
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,724
Chest-tube output has halted
over the last two hours.

166
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:07,630
What's your plan?

167
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,554
Chest x-ray and check the
tube for possible occlusion.

168
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:11,455
Good.

169
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,780
He's doing fine.

170
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:15,070
Thank you.

171
00:08:24,543 --> 00:08:27,465
I know you think I like Meredith,
but I don't like Meredith.

172
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:28,474
What?

173
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,890
No. I like Meredith. Obviously, I like Meredith.

174
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,106
I just - I just don't have a thing for her.

175
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:34,121
Okay.

176
00:08:34,198 --> 00:08:37,285
It's just this morning
- I know you were probably just teasing,

177
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:40,214
but I don't want you to say anything like
that to her, because we live together,

178
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,350
and that would be really awkward.

179
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:43,245
- George, stop talking.
- Okay.

180
00:08:48,993 --> 00:08:49,901
Morning.

181
00:08:51,662 --> 00:08:55,513
Mr. Levangie, this is Dr. Bailey and
her fine staff of surgical interns.

182
00:09:01,462 --> 00:09:03,230
Welcome to hell, kids.

183
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:07,037
Who's presenting?

184
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:11,893
Edward Levangie is a 63-year-old man
admitted for pain management for dyskinesia.

185
00:09:11,973 --> 00:09:15,675
He's been stable since last night and
responding well to the bolus injections.

186
00:09:15,783 --> 00:09:17,391
Izzie, possible treatments?

187
00:09:17,482 --> 00:09:18,625
For parkinson's disease?

188
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:22,761
- Deep brain stimulation has shown very -
- Not for parkinson's - for spinal pain.

189
00:09:26,668 --> 00:09:31,501
Intraspinal catheter - that way, he
can have constant pain medication.

190
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:32,605
Excellent.

191
00:09:32,935 --> 00:09:34,092
This is Dr. Grey.

192
00:09:34,204 --> 00:09:36,801
She's gonna prep you for the procedure and assist.

193
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:41,061
Excuse me.

194
00:09:46,676 --> 00:09:49,196
You make yourselves busy. I'll catch up with you.

195
00:10:06,226 --> 00:10:07,028
Miranda.

196
00:10:07,121 --> 00:10:08,115
Excuse me?

197
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:09,896
Well, that's your name, right?

198
00:10:09,982 --> 00:10:10,977
It's on your jacket.

199
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,989
All right, fine, I'll just call you "Bailey" then.

200
00:10:13,087 --> 00:10:17,484
You think you're charming in that talented,
neurotic, overly moussed hair sort of way.

201
00:10:17,546 --> 00:10:18,611
Good for you.

202
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:21,452
But if you think I'm gonna stand
back and watch while you favor her -

203
00:10:21,524 --> 00:10:23,091
I don't favor her. She's good.

204
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,571
I'm sure she is.

205
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:27,167
Can I point out that, technically, I'm your boss.

206
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:28,436
You don't scare me.

207
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:32,989
Look, I'm not gonna advertise your
extracurricular activities with my intern.

208
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,397
However, the next time I see you
favoring Meredith Grey in any way,

209
00:10:36,566 --> 00:10:39,669
I'll make sure she doesn't see the
inside of an O.R. for a month...

210
00:10:40,448 --> 00:10:42,153
just for the sake of balance.

211
00:10:45,723 --> 00:10:47,236
- We're all set, doc.
- Okay.

212
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,342
Annie... there's gonna be a microphone
in there for you in case you get scared

213
00:10:52,408 --> 00:10:55,240
or you want to get out, but try not to do that,

214
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:58,127
because then we're gonna have
to start all over again.

215
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,007
I'm fine. I'll be fine.

216
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:03,054
I know you're gonna be fine, because
I'm gonna be right over there,

217
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:05,061
behind that glass, waiting for you.

218
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:06,944
All right?

219
00:11:07,145 --> 00:11:07,732
Okay.

220
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:08,511
You ready?

221
00:11:08,675 --> 00:11:09,837
Are you really ready?

222
00:11:10,564 --> 00:11:11,358
Let's do this.

223
00:11:11,987 --> 00:11:12,669
See ya.

224
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:23,226
Oh, hey, man, you got an extra battery?

225
00:11:24,054 --> 00:11:25,233
Unbelievable.

226
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:28,183
Oh, I know, right?

227
00:11:28,285 --> 00:11:29,775
I've never seen anything like this.

228
00:11:29,968 --> 00:11:30,794
God.

229
00:11:31,198 --> 00:11:34,731
Yeah, well, what I don't understand is
how a person lets it get like that.

230
00:11:34,798 --> 00:11:38,423
I mean, man, that is a whole lot of nasty.

231
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:39,964
Maybe she's afraid of doctors.

232
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:41,397
Poor thing.

233
00:11:41,515 --> 00:11:42,785
Poor thing? Please.

234
00:11:43,046 --> 00:11:45,042
If you're afraid of doctors, you take a pill.

235
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:48,483
She's just sick, like, warped, you know?

236
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,041
Seriously, I don't know how
she lives with herself.

237
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,402
Well, at first, we thought she
was just putting on weight.

238
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,913
When we realized what was happening, I
tried to get her to go to the doctor,

239
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:06,524
but she was scared.

240
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:10,018
And the bigger it got, the less she wanted to go.

241
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:14,103
And she never really felt all
that sick until last night.

242
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:15,966
She couldn't breathe.

243
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:18,623
Because the tumor was crushing her lungs.

244
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,835
Yes, well, I called 911.

245
00:12:21,332 --> 00:12:23,590
It just seemed like the right thing to do.

246
00:12:26,903 --> 00:12:29,644
You know, the right thing to do would
have been to call a year ago.

247
00:12:31,525 --> 00:12:32,452
Thank you.

248
00:12:34,924 --> 00:12:36,589
Okay, Mr. Levangie.

249
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:40,480
We're gonna get you more comfortable, okay?

250
00:12:40,951 --> 00:12:43,977
I'm gonna go downstairs, and
I'll be back up shortly.

251
00:12:44,158 --> 00:12:45,181
- Okay.
- Okay.

252
00:12:48,745 --> 00:12:50,044
Excuse me.

253
00:12:51,156 --> 00:12:53,654
- I'm sorry, doctor...
- Grey.

254
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:55,149
My dad seems to like you.

255
00:12:55,246 --> 00:12:56,660
He's always liked skinny blondes.

256
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,450
Is that rude? I'm sorry. I'm so tired.

257
00:12:59,982 --> 00:13:01,064
Is there something...

258
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,795
I was wondering if you would talk to him.

259
00:13:04,303 --> 00:13:06,475
- About?
- Brain surgery.

260
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,582
The doctor mentioned it, and
I've read about it on-line.

261
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:13,689
If it worked, it could help with
most of his symptoms, not just pain.

262
00:13:14,237 --> 00:13:17,295
- Is he a candidate?
- He is, but he's afraid of it.

263
00:13:17,483 --> 00:13:20,109
Surgery on his back, he can
understand, but his brain -

264
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:22,772
and... there are risks.

265
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,464
- But his quality of life -
- There isn't any.

266
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:28,085
And it keeps getting worse.

267
00:13:29,822 --> 00:13:31,634
I'm getting married next month.

268
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,606
I already lost my mom.

269
00:13:33,908 --> 00:13:35,704
And I want him to walk...

270
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,778
I want him with me. Maybe that's selfish, but...

271
00:13:41,516 --> 00:13:43,493
you don't know what it's like having a parent -

272
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:45,479
watching him...

273
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:47,675
I do.

274
00:13:48,504 --> 00:13:49,872
I do know what it's like.

275
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:52,309
I'll see what I can do.

276
00:13:53,256 --> 00:13:54,132
Thanks.

277
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,739
You're welcome.

278
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:57,624
Thank you.

279
00:14:02,952 --> 00:14:07,065
The right hemidiaphragm is so high that
it's completely displacing her lung tissue.

280
00:14:07,161 --> 00:14:09,481
It's infiltrated her spinal canal in three places.

281
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,935
We should start there.

282
00:14:12,015 --> 00:14:14,453
It's gonna take three or four hours
just to get around those nerves.

283
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,869
I'd prefer to start in front and then flip her.

284
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:18,917
You never know what kind of vessels are involved.

285
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:21,817
I'm gonna need a good head start.

286
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:25,210
If I miss a step, she's paralyzed.

287
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:27,280
If I don't relieve the
pressure on her lungs, she'll

288
00:14:27,293 --> 00:14:29,276
be dead, so she won't
mind if she can't walk.

289
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,554
Do you think she really wants to live?

290
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:34,760
Come on. She's been housebound.

291
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:38,927
She's been living under this thing,
just watching it grow for how long?

292
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:42,526
She doesn't seem stupid - doesn't
even seem all that scared.

293
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,352
Why would anyone wait this long
unless they wanted to die?

294
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:47,759
People do things every day that
they know could kill them -

295
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,782
doesn't mean they want to die.

296
00:14:49,872 --> 00:14:51,839
Well, what are her chances
of surviving the surgery?

297
00:14:51,962 --> 00:14:53,770
Slightly better than if we do nothing.

298
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:55,470
So is it worth it?

299
00:14:56,847 --> 00:14:59,970
Hey, come on. You were already thinking it.
I'm just saying.

300
00:15:01,353 --> 00:15:03,365
She's 43. It's worth a try.

301
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,057
Morning.

302
00:15:15,987 --> 00:15:17,302
Dr. Shepherd...

303
00:15:18,228 --> 00:15:20,569
Mr. Levangie, the parkinson's patient -

304
00:15:20,722 --> 00:15:22,549
is he a good candidate for DBS?

305
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,725
Yes, but he's not interested.

306
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,184
Okay, but I think it's worth
talking to him again, pushing him.

307
00:15:28,274 --> 00:15:29,758
We're talking about a brain surgery

308
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,848
that is performed while the patient is wide awake.

309
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,729
There is a risk of paralysis, a risk of
death, and the patient doesn't want it.

310
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,562
It is not my job to push him into
anything, and it's definitely not yours.

311
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:44,202
Since you're uncomfortable with my decision in
this, it's probably best you don't scrub in.

312
00:15:44,304 --> 00:15:46,501
It's a minor procedure. You won't be missed.

313
00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:57,556
You know, they call you the Nazi.

314
00:15:57,864 --> 00:15:59,112
So I've heard.

315
00:16:05,246 --> 00:16:06,475
I won't lie to you.

316
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:09,208
The surgery is going to be long and difficult,

317
00:16:09,306 --> 00:16:12,190
but we have an extremely capable
surgical team, and I can -

318
00:16:12,252 --> 00:16:13,788
Am I gonna die?

319
00:16:15,972 --> 00:16:17,462
There's always that risk,

320
00:16:17,928 --> 00:16:19,398
but if we don't do the surgery...

321
00:16:20,785 --> 00:16:22,070
I'll definitely die.

322
00:16:22,554 --> 00:16:23,274
Yes.

323
00:16:23,954 --> 00:16:24,850
Soon?

324
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:26,029
Yes.

325
00:16:29,382 --> 00:16:31,655
- Mom, the room's clean.
- Okay, honey, okay.

326
00:16:31,752 --> 00:16:32,438
Mom!

327
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:34,588
She'll have the surgery.

328
00:16:34,834 --> 00:16:35,562
Mom.

329
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:37,820
No. No, Annie.

330
00:16:38,573 --> 00:16:40,216
She will have the surgery.

331
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:46,740
I guess I'll have the surgery...

332
00:16:46,979 --> 00:16:49,406
I think that is a very wise decision.

333
00:16:49,482 --> 00:16:52,247
On one condition - I don't want him there.

334
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:57,153
I'm sorry, Annie. Did I upset you in some way?

335
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,534
If he's in the surgery, I'm not having it.

336
00:17:03,016 --> 00:17:04,767
That's how I live with myself.

337
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,680
Okay, Ms. Connors.

338
00:17:09,068 --> 00:17:10,076
Dr. Karev.

339
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,125
What the hell did you do?

340
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:23,158
Nothing. I don't know.

341
00:17:23,295 --> 00:17:25,234
Man. The mike must have been on.

342
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:27,541
If anything goes wrong, anything,

343
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,541
you are 60% more likely to be sued
if you've offended the patient -

344
00:17:30,613 --> 00:17:32,885
- 60%.
- I never would have said that stuff.

345
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:35,983
The mike shouldn't have been on. I
didn't realize she could hear me.

346
00:17:36,183 --> 00:17:38,431
Now you won't realize your chance to scrub in.

347
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:41,529
You're banned from the O.R. -
mine or anyone else's - all week.

348
00:17:41,606 --> 00:17:44,826
I got the history on the tumor. It's
been growing for a year and a half.

349
00:17:45,057 --> 00:17:47,586
A year and a half, and it's the first
time she's even had it looked at.

350
00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:49,075
It's like she's fatally lazy.

351
00:17:53,294 --> 00:17:55,338
Why doesn't she get banned?

352
00:17:56,586 --> 00:17:59,572
Go prep Annie Connors for surgery.
You're scrubbing in with Cristina.

353
00:17:59,749 --> 00:18:01,081
Really? I mean, thank you.

354
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:02,827
Okay.

355
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:07,486
We just need to recheck your labs and get an
EKG, so I just need to take a little blood.

356
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:09,693
Dr. Burke is great

357
00:18:09,895 --> 00:18:10,953
and Dr. Bailey.

358
00:18:11,394 --> 00:18:12,617
I know you're probably scared.

359
00:18:12,694 --> 00:18:13,749
That's okay, kitten.

360
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,367
You can just do your job.

361
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,194
You don't have to talk to
the fat, nasty tumor lady.

362
00:18:18,424 --> 00:18:21,414
I mean, I let it get this bad.
How much sympathy do I deserve?

363
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,387
Why did you let it get this bad?

364
00:18:27,932 --> 00:18:30,451
You're the first person since
I got here to ask me that.

365
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,400
Well, I guess it's just like
the elephant in the room.

366
00:18:33,518 --> 00:18:38,284
Elephant? It's more like a
giant sow, don't you think?

367
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,489
Every time I went to the hospital, someone died -

368
00:18:48,616 --> 00:18:50,349
all four of my grandparents,

369
00:18:50,624 --> 00:18:51,622
then my dad,

370
00:18:52,462 --> 00:18:53,640
my best friend's mom,

371
00:18:54,596 --> 00:18:55,815
my baby sister.

372
00:18:56,476 --> 00:18:59,364
They all went in - never came out.

373
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:02,006
So I put it off.

374
00:19:05,713 --> 00:19:08,273
You know, you're not the only one...
to put things off.

375
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,761
I mean, I never do anything
till the last possible minute.

376
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:12,124
Like what?

377
00:19:12,635 --> 00:19:13,325
Well...

378
00:19:15,974 --> 00:19:19,240
I've had this thing for my roommate
since, like, day one, and I just -

379
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,454
I... can't tell her.

380
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,765
She probably wouldn't go out
with me, anyway, but...

381
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:30,059
how do I know that for sure if I...
don't ever ask?

382
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:36,903
Seriously? You're equating your pathetic
love life with my record-breaking tumor?

383
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,214
Seriously?

384
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,904
It's just that he blatantly
favors me in front of her,

385
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,886
and then blatantly dismisses me.

386
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,330
How do you know he was favoring you?

387
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:54,000
Look, you've got a brain.
You got into this program.

388
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,930
Just because shepherd munched your cookies

389
00:19:55,996 --> 00:19:57,860
doesn't mean that you didn't
deserve what you worked for.

390
00:19:57,942 --> 00:19:59,375
But he's making me look bad.

391
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:01,843
I have to end it.

392
00:20:02,232 --> 00:20:03,087
Right.

393
00:20:03,308 --> 00:20:04,061
It's over.

394
00:20:05,156 --> 00:20:07,675
Is it true you get to scrub in on that tumor?

395
00:20:07,783 --> 00:20:08,658
Don't sit here.

396
00:20:08,746 --> 00:20:09,825
You get to scrub in?

397
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:11,429
How psyched are you?

398
00:20:11,516 --> 00:20:13,876
On a scale of one to ecstatic, ecstatic.

399
00:20:13,954 --> 00:20:15,852
That's unbelievable. You know what I think?

400
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,104
I think Burke wants to get into your scrubs.

401
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,304
Why are you sitting here?

402
00:20:19,456 --> 00:20:22,410
He kicked me off that surgery for
the same crap you pull every day.

403
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:25,779
If I stuck this fork into his
thigh, would I get in trouble?

404
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:27,587
Not if you make it look like an accident.

405
00:20:27,884 --> 00:20:28,552
Hey.

406
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:31,355
Thank god, man.

407
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,138
I'm drowning in estrogen here.

408
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:36,148
Look, is everything okay?

409
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:39,066
Shepherd's a jackass.

410
00:20:39,297 --> 00:20:41,099
Really? I think he's kind of great.

411
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,531
He reamed her out in front of Bailey.

412
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:44,346
Why?

413
00:20:44,524 --> 00:20:45,728
'Cause he's a jackass.

414
00:20:47,612 --> 00:20:50,382
Well, bad days are... bad.

415
00:20:50,797 --> 00:20:55,599
Maybe tonight, uh, if, you know,
if you drink alcohol, I mean,

416
00:20:55,665 --> 00:20:59,752
we could - all of us, I mean,
go out and drink alcohol...

417
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,249
because of the bad day.

418
00:21:07,502 --> 00:21:08,461
I got to go.

419
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:13,853
Dude.

420
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,357
Shut up.

421
00:21:28,731 --> 00:21:30,585
- How's your back?
- Still good.

422
00:21:32,102 --> 00:21:34,330
Can you lean forward for me? I
just want to check something.

423
00:21:34,992 --> 00:21:35,853
Does that feel okay?

424
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:37,215
Right here?

425
00:21:37,845 --> 00:21:38,772
Did you page?

426
00:21:40,574 --> 00:21:42,981
Mr. Levangie, have you given any more thought

427
00:21:43,032 --> 00:21:45,685
about the other surgical options
we discussed this morning?

428
00:21:45,922 --> 00:21:46,667
What?

429
00:21:47,685 --> 00:21:51,126
Why would I? I already told you no.

430
00:21:51,575 --> 00:21:54,395
I'm letting you cut into my back,

431
00:21:54,685 --> 00:21:56,559
but that's not enough for you.

432
00:21:56,769 --> 00:21:58,903
All you guys ever want to do is cut.

433
00:21:58,995 --> 00:22:00,382
Dad, just listen to what he has to say.

434
00:22:00,475 --> 00:22:02,093
I already listened.

435
00:22:02,528 --> 00:22:05,888
Sir, there's a very small
window of opportunity here.

436
00:22:06,056 --> 00:22:08,523
Once the parkinson's progresses
to a point of dementia,

437
00:22:08,601 --> 00:22:11,155
you're no longer a candidate for DBS.

438
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:13,839
And when I'm no longer a candidate,

439
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:18,247
is that when you people will
leave me the hell alone?!

440
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,403
What? Do I have to start drooling

441
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:25,784
and forget my name to get
a little peace and quiet?

442
00:22:26,274 --> 00:22:27,068
All right.

443
00:22:28,037 --> 00:22:29,378
I'll check back with you later.

444
00:22:29,485 --> 00:22:30,519
Try to get some rest.

445
00:22:31,452 --> 00:22:34,242
Dad, you're being unreasonable.

446
00:22:34,662 --> 00:22:36,557
The doctors are only trying to help you.

447
00:22:36,637 --> 00:22:39,291
It's my damn life, and it's my damn brain.

448
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:44,140
You want me to let them cut up my brain
while I'm lying here awake - for what?

449
00:22:44,236 --> 00:22:46,582
- Dad!
- I'll be at your wedding.

450
00:22:47,156 --> 00:22:51,164
I will sit in the back. Your uncle
will walk you down the aisle.

451
00:22:51,818 --> 00:22:54,901
I know it's not perfect, but it's life.

452
00:22:55,117 --> 00:22:57,057
Life is messy sometimes.

453
00:22:58,501 --> 00:22:59,725
I know that.

454
00:23:04,568 --> 00:23:05,914
If she knows...

455
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,991
then what the hell are we still talking for, huh?

456
00:23:10,678 --> 00:23:13,304
Why in hell can't she drop it?

457
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:18,162
It is your life.

458
00:23:18,808 --> 00:23:20,276
But it's her life, too.

459
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,902
And you have a chance to get better here.

460
00:23:23,317 --> 00:23:25,667
And all she's asking you to do is try.

461
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:38,310
If they pull this off, I'm totally calling Oprah.

462
00:23:39,072 --> 00:23:40,618
You two been working out?

463
00:23:41,944 --> 00:23:46,158
Sometimes I jog, and I try to take
the stairs whenever possible.

464
00:23:46,234 --> 00:23:46,972
Why?

465
00:23:47,352 --> 00:23:49,251
See that large pile of tumor?

466
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:52,486
You're gonna be retracting
it for the next 14 hours,

467
00:23:52,584 --> 00:23:55,369
so I'm just saying I hope you have strong backs.

468
00:23:58,544 --> 00:23:59,537
Dr. Shepherd.

469
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:00,914
Yes?

470
00:24:01,534 --> 00:24:04,106
Mr. Levangie has agreed to DBS...

471
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,835
if we do it today.

472
00:24:07,232 --> 00:24:08,979
If he leaves, he won't come back.

473
00:24:13,248 --> 00:24:14,755
Don't worry, Dr. Shepherd.

474
00:24:15,445 --> 00:24:17,692
It'll take hours before we
get around to the spine.

475
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:18,983
I'll page you.

476
00:24:20,786 --> 00:24:21,727
All right, then.

477
00:24:25,055 --> 00:24:25,855
Let's do it.

478
00:24:32,428 --> 00:24:33,345
Dr. Bailey...

479
00:24:35,838 --> 00:24:37,035
I didn't know...

480
00:24:38,552 --> 00:24:40,615
that he was my boss when I met him.

481
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:41,501
I didn't know.

482
00:24:41,578 --> 00:24:42,505
I don't care.

483
00:24:42,734 --> 00:24:43,639
Really?

484
00:24:44,046 --> 00:24:47,220
Oh, well, you sort of seemed to
not be talking to me, so I -

485
00:24:47,312 --> 00:24:49,467
You see this - what's happening right here?

486
00:24:49,565 --> 00:24:52,719
This is the problem with you
sleeping with my boss -

487
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:57,568
not whether or not you knew him
before, but how it affects my day.

488
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,354
And me standing here talking to you
about your sex life affects my day.

489
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:05,285
And the longer this little fling goes on,

490
00:25:05,391 --> 00:25:08,227
the more favors you get over the others,

491
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:12,062
who are fighting tooth and nail just to make it
through this program without any assistance -

492
00:25:12,118 --> 00:25:15,072
when those people start
finding out what's going on

493
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:18,923
and they don't want to work
with you and talk to you

494
00:25:18,989 --> 00:25:22,343
or look at you and they start
bitching and moaning at me,

495
00:25:23,157 --> 00:25:25,707
the more it affects my day.

496
00:25:26,244 --> 00:25:27,970
So, no, Dr. Grey,

497
00:25:28,067 --> 00:25:30,820
I don't care what you knew or when you knew it.

498
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:32,507
Are we understood?

499
00:25:33,762 --> 00:25:35,276
- Yes.
- Good.

500
00:25:48,101 --> 00:25:49,016
This sucks.

501
00:25:49,308 --> 00:25:51,121
Yeah, well, I'm not a real fan of yours, either.

502
00:25:51,187 --> 00:25:53,614
Not you - this - everyone else
is scrubbed in somewhere.

503
00:25:53,778 --> 00:25:55,453
Bright side - we have the run of the floor.

504
00:25:55,545 --> 00:25:57,179
Want to do it in the stairwell?

505
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:58,908
I'm just saying you never know what could happen.

506
00:26:02,856 --> 00:26:04,111
I'm changing.

507
00:26:04,365 --> 00:26:05,477
I'll page you if I need you.

508
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:06,686
You do that.

509
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,119
You are so my favorite person today.

510
00:26:16,378 --> 00:26:18,048
We need to hang another bag of O-neg.

511
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:23,591
Cauterizing the small bleeders
to keep my visual field clean.

512
00:26:23,643 --> 00:26:25,168
God, is your back killing you?

513
00:26:25,191 --> 00:26:26,627
George, shut up. We're in here.

514
00:26:26,687 --> 00:26:27,393
More suction, please.

515
00:26:34,305 --> 00:26:37,232
Mrs. Harper, let me show you these chest films.

516
00:26:39,186 --> 00:26:41,376
We were able to relieve the
obstruction of his chest tube,

517
00:26:41,436 --> 00:26:44,077
so the buildup of fluid you see
here should resolve itself soon.

518
00:26:47,614 --> 00:26:49,938
Which translates as he should be home in no time.

519
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,977
He was making waffles.

520
00:26:52,084 --> 00:26:52,796
I'm sorry?

521
00:26:53,175 --> 00:26:54,408
He was making waffles.

522
00:26:54,501 --> 00:26:56,604
He was mixing the batter, and -

523
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,085
and then, he was on the floor.

524
00:26:58,207 --> 00:27:00,267
Izzie, we need a central line run in 204.

525
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:02,125
- Page Dr. Karev, will you?
- He's not answering.

526
00:27:03,061 --> 00:27:04,116
I'm so sorry.

527
00:27:04,658 --> 00:27:05,806
I'll be back.

528
00:27:17,046 --> 00:27:18,504
Like what you see, right?

529
00:27:25,595 --> 00:27:26,558
Neuro sponge.

530
00:27:28,637 --> 00:27:29,973
How you doing, Mr. Levangie?

531
00:27:30,183 --> 00:27:30,966
All right.

532
00:27:32,682 --> 00:27:34,182
Where's blondie?

533
00:27:34,314 --> 00:27:35,216
I'm right here.

534
00:27:35,304 --> 00:27:36,430
Can't you see me?

535
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,359
I'm shaky. I'm not blind.

536
00:27:38,994 --> 00:27:41,672
Anything goes wrong here, I'm blaming you.

537
00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:44,985
Okay, in that case, I'll
stay where you can see me.

538
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:50,238
We just have to drill a hole and try to find
the spot that controls the motor function.

539
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,439
You can't see my brain from there.

540
00:27:52,561 --> 00:27:54,713
Aren't you supposed to be learning something?

541
00:27:54,866 --> 00:27:56,376
I'm good right here.

542
00:27:59,664 --> 00:28:02,439
Okay, Mr. Levangie, just
take a couple deep breaths.

543
00:28:02,521 --> 00:28:03,827
Focus on the pretty girl.

544
00:28:05,301 --> 00:28:08,393
Okay, this is gonna sound really
scary, but try and relax.

545
00:28:08,527 --> 00:28:09,878
You shouldn't feel a thing.

546
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,720
- Any pain here?
- No.

547
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:13,703
Here?

548
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:15,516
Okay.

549
00:28:15,731 --> 00:28:18,398
Dr. Stevens, I need you to
check the x-ray in 2103.

550
00:28:18,456 --> 00:28:23,237
2118 needs post-op notes, and Jane’s wondering
if you want her to start feeding 2112.

551
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:24,451
I'm going on break.

552
00:28:24,554 --> 00:28:27,584
Okay, yeah, before you do that,
could you page Dr. Karev again?

553
00:28:27,676 --> 00:28:28,890
- I already paged him.
- Yeah, again?

554
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:36,122
- How is it?
- Long and slow.

555
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,631
I don't envy those two.

556
00:28:37,769 --> 00:28:39,899
They've been holding that thing for eight hours.

557
00:28:40,078 --> 00:28:42,151
Their arms have to be ready to fall off.

558
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:47,068
Look at the size of this artery.

559
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:48,529
My god.

560
00:28:48,889 --> 00:28:50,620
It's as thick as a thumb.

561
00:28:51,834 --> 00:28:53,897
You ever seen a vessel this size?

562
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:55,223
No.

563
00:28:56,376 --> 00:28:58,946
This thing's just feeding on all her blood.

564
00:28:59,873 --> 00:29:01,434
We need more O-negative.

565
00:29:02,126 --> 00:29:03,365
I'll call the blood bank.

566
00:29:06,857 --> 00:29:07,892
Damn it, O'Malley.

567
00:29:08,443 --> 00:29:09,797
Do you want me to kill this patient?!

568
00:29:09,862 --> 00:29:10,850
No, I - sorry.

569
00:29:11,432 --> 00:29:13,775
I mean, is the art of retracting
just too much for you?

570
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,684
No, I was, uh - um...

571
00:29:18,411 --> 00:29:19,385
I had an itch.

572
00:29:22,144 --> 00:29:23,252
Way to go, George.

573
00:29:23,435 --> 00:29:24,403
Nicely done.

574
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,453
Just keep trying, Mr. Levangie.

575
00:29:28,596 --> 00:29:29,846
Mimic my motions.

576
00:29:30,225 --> 00:29:31,295
You can do it.

577
00:29:32,472 --> 00:29:34,571
You're doing great, Mr. Levangie.

578
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,124
Just a little longer.

579
00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:37,455
Oh, damn it!

580
00:29:39,852 --> 00:29:41,607
Take a breath and try again.

581
00:29:41,934 --> 00:29:43,594
One more time, Mr. Levangie.

582
00:29:44,736 --> 00:29:46,138
The probe is almost in.

583
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,750
You'll know it when we find the right spot.

584
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:02,138
Well, how about that?

585
00:30:02,282 --> 00:30:03,096
There it is.

586
00:30:04,218 --> 00:30:05,815
I'll be a son of a bitch.

587
00:30:15,671 --> 00:30:18,271
Bailey was on a war path.
I was trying to protect you.

588
00:30:18,342 --> 00:30:20,953
You trying to protect me is
why she's on the war path.

589
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,520
You can't do me favors.

590
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:24,696
You can't ask me to scrub in
when I haven't earned it.

591
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,796
Okay. Okay.

592
00:30:25,873 --> 00:30:28,464
And you can't treat me like crap
when I haven't earned that.

593
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:30,245
I can take care of myself.

594
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:32,380
I got myself into this mess, and I...

595
00:30:33,017 --> 00:30:34,352
And you'll get yourself out?

596
00:30:34,587 --> 00:30:37,383
I don't... know that yet.

597
00:30:42,323 --> 00:30:43,585
Don't let me keep you.

598
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:44,930
You did great work here today.

599
00:30:48,364 --> 00:30:49,455
Dr. Shepherd.

600
00:30:49,768 --> 00:30:50,577
Yeah?

601
00:30:51,568 --> 00:30:53,690
Sorry I called you a jackass.

602
00:30:53,874 --> 00:30:54,698
You didn't.

603
00:30:54,984 --> 00:30:57,115
I did... twice.

604
00:30:59,956 --> 00:31:01,421
Tell you what, blondie,

605
00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:04,114
if you don't marry him, I will.

606
00:31:19,542 --> 00:31:21,957
No, no, no, Jimmy!

607
00:31:22,069 --> 00:31:23,763
No, no, Jimmy, no!

608
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,481
What we got?

609
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:27,988
Pressure plummeted to 64/22, and he has
runs of v-tach that aren't perfusing.

610
00:31:28,044 --> 00:31:29,319
Cvp is sky-high.

611
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,999
Give him dopamine - 10 mikes.

612
00:31:31,064 --> 00:31:31,996
He's already maxed out.

613
00:31:32,063 --> 00:31:34,014
The resident was here an hour
ago, but I can't reach him now.

614
00:31:34,081 --> 00:31:37,316
- Of course.
- What is the matter with you?!

615
00:31:37,383 --> 00:31:38,284
Get her out of here!

616
00:31:38,371 --> 00:31:40,418
Mrs. Harper, you have to get out of here.

617
00:31:41,675 --> 00:31:44,065
Does he have a myocardial ischemia?

618
00:31:44,146 --> 00:31:45,651
No, it's a clot - big one.

619
00:31:45,733 --> 00:31:46,920
Page someone. Page anyone.

620
00:31:46,994 --> 00:31:49,004
He'll be dead before they get here.

621
00:31:49,092 --> 00:31:52,036
You have to do something. Do anything, please!

622
00:31:52,128 --> 00:31:54,981
- You said he was okay!
- Get out of here now!

623
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:56,260
You have to cut.

624
00:31:56,843 --> 00:31:59,614
I can't. I've never even seen it done.
I could kill him.

625
00:31:59,697 --> 00:32:00,883
Do nothing, you'll kill him faster.

626
00:32:00,945 --> 00:32:02,486
- What's your glove size?
- 6.

627
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:04,631
Oh, god. Oh, god.

628
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:06,362
Take a breath, Dr. Stevens.

629
00:32:06,629 --> 00:32:07,908
She has to move over there.

630
00:32:08,113 --> 00:32:09,251
Walter, move out of the way.

631
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:15,646
Cut the stitches and then the staples.

632
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:17,765
Don't let them fall into the chest cavity.

633
00:32:17,892 --> 00:32:20,350
Wait. I've never cracked a chest before.

634
00:32:20,631 --> 00:32:22,300
Oh, god. Oh, god.

635
00:32:28,094 --> 00:32:30,259
No pulse. Wide complex rhythm.

636
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,550
I can't get this clot out. I
need more suction. I need more.

637
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:34,296
He's bradying down.

638
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:36,334
You have to get the clot out.

639
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,247
I can't get it.

640
00:32:39,897 --> 00:32:40,635
Screw it.

641
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,735
I'm using my hand.

642
00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:47,531
Oh, god, look at the size of that clot.

643
00:32:48,928 --> 00:32:49,661
Anything?

644
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:50,537
No.

645
00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:53,194
You have to massage the heart, doctor.

646
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,600
Come on.

647
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:04,442
Come on, please.

648
00:33:05,871 --> 00:33:07,167
Come on, Mr. Harper.

649
00:33:08,896 --> 00:33:10,627
We have a pulse.

650
00:33:19,803 --> 00:33:21,232
Okay, more suction.

651
00:33:21,283 --> 00:33:22,350
How's it going?

652
00:33:23,009 --> 00:33:25,733
It's more intertwined than
the studies made it look.

653
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,999
I need another bag.

654
00:33:27,485 --> 00:33:29,805
Call the blood bank. We need more O-negative.

655
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:33,338
I'm down 10 units of blood, and
I haven't even flipped her yet.

656
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:34,429
Oh, wow.

657
00:33:36,093 --> 00:33:37,269
Hold it steady.

658
00:33:37,926 --> 00:33:38,812
Look at that.

659
00:33:39,277 --> 00:33:39,958
Sponge.

660
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,459
Now, how am I supposed to get around that artery?

661
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:50,802
All right, then.

662
00:33:51,223 --> 00:33:51,981
Forceps.

663
00:33:54,191 --> 00:33:54,903
Here you go.

664
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,381
Excuse me.

665
00:33:58,683 --> 00:34:00,340
God, it's unbelievable.

666
00:34:00,555 --> 00:34:01,282
Right.

667
00:34:02,004 --> 00:34:03,827
How did she live like that?

668
00:34:04,525 --> 00:34:06,745
Watch what you say. You
never know who's listening.

669
00:34:09,267 --> 00:34:10,227
Look at George.

670
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:11,885
He looks like he's about to fall in.

671
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:17,191
Are you really as shallow and callous as you seem?

672
00:34:17,421 --> 00:34:22,192
Oh, you want to go out for a drink
later and hear about my secret pain?

673
00:34:22,495 --> 00:34:24,425
Does that line ever work for you?

674
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:25,429
Sometimes.

675
00:34:27,508 --> 00:34:29,698
Must be because you look like that.

676
00:34:30,104 --> 00:34:30,958
Like what?

677
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:34,945
So, is that a yes?

678
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,365
No.

679
00:34:37,403 --> 00:34:39,487
I can't. I'm seeing someone.

680
00:34:39,816 --> 00:34:42,734
Look, if you don't want to go
out with me, just say so -

681
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:44,306
no need to lie.

682
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,702
Oh, okay.

683
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:48,831
Well, I don't want to go out with you.

684
00:34:49,902 --> 00:34:53,118
But I think I really might be seeing someone.

685
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,812
No, it's up here. It's up here.

686
00:34:57,503 --> 00:34:59,485
We're still in the middle of surgery.

687
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,641
Mr. Harper, the post-op heart patient in 2114-

688
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,786
I had to open his sternotomy bedside.

689
00:35:05,657 --> 00:35:06,984
- You what?
- What?

690
00:35:07,315 --> 00:35:08,073
What?

691
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:10,441
He had cardiac tamponade.

692
00:35:10,648 --> 00:35:13,670
His chest films were clean this morning.
It happened fast.

693
00:35:13,732 --> 00:35:15,503
He was in P.E.A. There was no time.

694
00:35:17,566 --> 00:35:18,656
Go ahead. I got it.

695
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:20,936
We're okay here.

696
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:23,075
Yeah, I need some retraction.

697
00:35:23,153 --> 00:35:24,411
- Pull back on the retractor.
- I got it.

698
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,498
You opened a heart bedside, and
you couldn't even page me?

699
00:35:28,717 --> 00:35:30,657
Needed all the glory for yourself, right?

700
00:35:30,744 --> 00:35:34,574
I paged you 50 times. Do you have
any idea what I have been through?

701
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:36,853
Oh, man.

702
00:35:37,544 --> 00:35:39,041
The battery - I forgot to change it.

703
00:35:39,147 --> 00:35:40,145
You forgot?

704
00:35:40,585 --> 00:35:42,629
You forgot?! You are hateful!

705
00:35:42,721 --> 00:35:47,247
You are a hateful, lazy, arrogant, hateful man!

706
00:35:48,194 --> 00:35:49,147
Hateful!

707
00:35:49,465 --> 00:35:51,690
Never a dull moment here at Seattle grace.

708
00:35:52,909 --> 00:35:53,719
Oh, my god.

709
00:35:53,877 --> 00:35:55,167
Get right in there. Get it.

710
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,339
She can't afford to lose this much blood.

711
00:35:57,421 --> 00:36:00,155
Get me some suction here. I
can't see what I'm doing.

712
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:01,819
Clamp, clamp, clamp, please.

713
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,603
- Is there any blood in the rapid infuser?
- We're waiting on two units.

714
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:10,544
What do you mean you're waiting?

715
00:36:10,631 --> 00:36:12,633
We didn't anticipate this much blood loss.

716
00:36:12,757 --> 00:36:15,280
We prepped a double supply. We've used it all.

717
00:36:15,367 --> 00:36:16,528
- What did you cut?
- Nothing.

718
00:36:16,685 --> 00:36:17,830
It just blew.

719
00:36:17,932 --> 00:36:19,924
She came in with too much damage.

720
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:22,500
- The artery walls are too weak.
- Take care of it.

721
00:36:22,699 --> 00:36:24,952
- Annie, come on.
- ...10 units of O-negative.

722
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,619
I cannot see - what's this?
George, give me your hand.

723
00:36:27,696 --> 00:36:30,526
Push right down here. Pull. Suction, suction!

724
00:36:30,612 --> 00:36:31,522
The pressure's dropping.

725
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:33,489
She needs blood. Where the hell is the blood?!

726
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:40,507
Somebody grab that. Push it back, George. Come on.

727
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:46,333
Oh, god. Just squeeze it off right there.

728
00:36:46,923 --> 00:36:47,701
Here we go.

729
00:36:53,673 --> 00:36:55,114
Is that O-negative for O.R. 1?

730
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:57,020
- Uh-huh, O.R. 1.
- O.R. 1, right?

731
00:36:57,142 --> 00:36:58,401
- I got it!
- I got it!

732
00:37:02,018 --> 00:37:03,599
Some suction, please, in here, now.

733
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:07,039
We're losing her now. Look at this.

734
00:37:07,495 --> 00:37:08,237
Come on.

735
00:37:24,202 --> 00:37:25,281
Oh, come on!

736
00:37:25,758 --> 00:37:26,465
Come on!

737
00:37:56,422 --> 00:37:59,274
Time of death is 11:42.

738
00:38:15,895 --> 00:38:16,677
I got it!

739
00:38:39,953 --> 00:38:42,067
The early bird catches the worm.

740
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,725
A stitch in time saves nine.

741
00:38:47,522 --> 00:38:48,228
Messy.

742
00:38:48,924 --> 00:38:49,542
I'm sorry.

743
00:38:50,249 --> 00:38:50,939
Don't be.

744
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:52,681
You saved his life.

745
00:39:01,652 --> 00:39:04,074
He who hesitates is lost.

746
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,869
We can't pretend we haven't been told.

747
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,249
We've all heard the proverbs,

748
00:39:22,604 --> 00:39:24,011
heard the philosophers,

749
00:39:24,661 --> 00:39:27,933
heard our grandparents warning
us about wasted time,

750
00:39:29,237 --> 00:39:32,049
heard the damn poets urging us to seize the day.

751
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,632
Still, sometimes,

752
00:39:37,132 --> 00:39:39,002
we have to see for ourselves.

753
00:39:52,543 --> 00:39:54,536
I'm not doing you any more favors.

754
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,021
This was it.

755
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:00,327
I've been holding 50 pounds of
tumor for the past 12 hours.

756
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:03,409
My back's gonna need traction,
and the patient died anyways.

757
00:40:03,491 --> 00:40:05,847
And you think you did me a favor?

758
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:08,187
Look, I'm just...

759
00:40:10,286 --> 00:40:11,279
What is this...

760
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:14,621
that we're doing here?

761
00:40:15,928 --> 00:40:16,762
What is it?

762
00:40:20,715 --> 00:40:22,349
You need a definition?

763
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,170
You really want to be that guy?

764
00:40:29,332 --> 00:40:31,682
We have to make our own mistakes.

765
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,405
Lock the door.

766
00:40:37,898 --> 00:40:40,131
We have to learn our own lessons.

767
00:40:40,411 --> 00:40:41,911
Have you seen Meredith?

768
00:40:42,932 --> 00:40:45,767
Save yourself the misery, man.
She's off the market.

769
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:46,478
What?

770
00:40:46,643 --> 00:40:48,332
No, that's not - we're just friends.

771
00:40:49,177 --> 00:40:49,961
Whatever.

772
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:53,657
But she's not. I mean, if she was seeing someone
- I live with her - I would know it.

773
00:41:03,944 --> 00:41:09,959
We have to sweep today's possibility under
tomorrow's rug until we can't anymore,

774
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:15,294
until we finally understand for ourselves
what Benjamin Franklin meant...

775
00:41:18,049 --> 00:41:20,671
...that knowing is better than wondering...

776
00:41:25,862 --> 00:41:28,673
...that waking is better than sleeping...

777
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:36,016
I, um, know this place

778
00:41:36,773 --> 00:41:42,026
where there's an amazing view
of sunrise over the ferryboats.

779
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,111
I have a thing for ferryboats.

780
00:41:48,253 --> 00:41:49,399
I remember.

781
00:42:01,493 --> 00:42:03,633
...and that even the biggest failure,

782
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:07,310
even the worst, most intractable mistake

783
00:42:07,565 --> 00:42:09,803
beats the hell out of never trying.
