1
00:00:01,347 --> 00:00:03,029
Previously on Grey's Anatomy.

2
00:00:03,611 --> 00:00:04,812
We had sex once.

3
00:00:05,113 --> 00:00:05,653
Go out with me.

4
00:00:06,115 --> 00:00:06,976
You know you're my boss.

5
00:00:07,275 --> 00:00:08,298
You know it's against the rules.

6
00:00:08,417 --> 00:00:09,198
Do you like Izzy?

7
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:10,420
Is that what this is about?

8
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:10,662
Izzy?

9
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:10,981
No.

10
00:00:11,061 --> 00:00:12,445
She's not the one I'm attracted to.

11
00:00:12,744 --> 00:00:14,166
Not the one, so there's a one.

12
00:00:14,227 --> 00:00:16,530
Haven't you ever been attracted to someone you know you couldn't have?

13
00:00:17,472 --> 00:00:19,214
Meredith.

14
00:00:19,254 --> 00:00:20,577
Just coffee.

15
00:00:20,597 --> 00:00:20,838
Good.

16
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:22,300
Okay.

17
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:22,420
Okay.

18
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,329
Your mother's Alzheimer's is advancing, so while she's still lucid enough to consent, she needs to sign everything over to you.

19
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,210
Me?

20
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:31,772
Thanks for the coffee.

21
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,762
So you blew me off for a bottle of tequila.

22
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:39,664
It's not nearly as much fun to wake up to.

23
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:42,929
You mind moving this tail wagon?

24
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:44,212
You're blocking me in.

25
00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:52,804
A couple hundred years ago, Benjamin Franklin shared with the world the secret of his success.

26
00:00:54,307 --> 00:00:58,613
Never leave that till tomorrow, he said, which you can do today.

27
00:00:59,695 --> 00:00:59,856
Save me.

28
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,102
This is the man who discovered electricity.

29
00:01:07,763 --> 00:01:10,207
You'd think more of us would listen to what he had to say.

30
00:01:10,268 --> 00:01:22,629
I don't know why we put things off, but if I had to guess, I'd say it has a lot to do with fear.

31
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:29,960
Fear of failure, fear of pain, fear of rejection.

32
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:41,801
Wouldn't it be easier to just ask her out?

33
00:01:52,174 --> 00:01:52,995
She's going to be late.

34
00:01:53,016 --> 00:01:53,637
Maybe not.

35
00:01:56,435 --> 00:01:57,536
We should wait for her.

36
00:01:57,555 --> 00:01:58,257
Definitely not.

37
00:01:59,097 --> 00:02:01,260
I'm not her mother, and you are not her boyfriend.

38
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:02,581
Not yet, anyway.

39
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,402
Stop, okay?

40
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:04,703
I told you I'm not interested.

41
00:02:05,664 --> 00:02:06,745
Life is short, George.

42
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:09,328
Do you really want to die before you ever ask her out?

43
00:02:09,927 --> 00:02:12,850
I do not want to ask her out.

44
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:14,573
Do you really want to die or lie?

45
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,754
I'm not... I'm not dying.

46
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:21,699
Sometimes the fear is just of making a decision.

47
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:26,629
Because what if you're wrong?

48
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,572
What if you're making a mistake you can't undo?

49
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:31,594
Crap.

50
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:32,015
Crap.

51
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:33,776
Hi, I'm late.

52
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:35,758
You're avoiding me.

53
00:02:35,778 --> 00:02:37,080
Yes, but also late.

54
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,383
Oh, are we going to talk about this?

55
00:02:39,402 --> 00:02:39,582
No.

56
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,645
About us and Bailey and what she saw?

57
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:43,627
I don't need to talk about it.

58
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:45,288
I experienced it naked.

59
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:47,229
Yes, this is getting complicated.

60
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,572
Complicated for me.

61
00:02:48,731 --> 00:02:50,332
I'm the intern sleeping with the attending.

62
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:52,435
Bailey isn't speaking to me anymore.

63
00:02:52,895 --> 00:02:54,116
Well, not that that's a bad thing.

64
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,171
If I was a better guy, I'd walk away.

65
00:02:57,352 --> 00:02:57,832
Yes, you would.

66
00:02:57,853 --> 00:03:01,575
Do you want me to be a better guy?

67
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:02,858
Yes.

68
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:05,901
No.

69
00:03:08,323 --> 00:03:10,145
Crap.

70
00:03:10,164 --> 00:03:10,504
I'm late.

71
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:12,486
Take your time.

72
00:03:14,368 --> 00:03:14,909
Think about it.

73
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:23,157
That was definitely worth being late.

74
00:03:29,432 --> 00:03:33,359
Is this a... Should we talk about this?

75
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:44,275
Yeah, definitely.

76
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:49,301
You're late.

77
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:50,524
So are you.

78
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,106
I know, and I can't afford to piss off Bailey anymore.

79
00:03:53,147 --> 00:03:54,288
Do you think she told anyone?

80
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:55,790
About you and McDreamy?

81
00:03:55,872 --> 00:03:56,331
Yeah.

82
00:03:56,352 --> 00:03:57,274
No.

83
00:03:57,294 --> 00:03:58,275
He's her boss, too.

84
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:01,052
If they find out, what can they kick me out, or?

85
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:01,373
No.

86
00:04:02,955 --> 00:04:03,496
Not officially.

87
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:12,066
He'll just get edged out, blacklisted, banned from his surgeries, passed over for chief resident.

88
00:04:13,508 --> 00:04:15,389
It'll be humiliating, but he'll live.

89
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:16,791
I have to end it.

90
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:19,696
I definitely have to end it.

91
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,199
I have to end it, right?

92
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,060
Meredith, shut up.

93
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:25,882
What?

94
00:04:27,314 --> 00:04:29,278
Did you seriously just tell me to shut up?

95
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:30,339
Oh, please.

96
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,526
Even a hot doctor likes to make you open up and say, ah.

97
00:04:33,547 --> 00:04:34,329
It's an American dream.

98
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:35,271
Stop whining about it.

99
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:36,192
No.

100
00:04:36,293 --> 00:04:38,276
No good can come from sleeping with your boss.

101
00:04:38,297 --> 00:04:39,158
Christina, you're late.

102
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,240
So is Meredith.

103
00:04:41,103 --> 00:04:44,310
Whatever it is we're afraid of, one thing holds true.

104
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:51,718
that by the time the pain of not doing a thing gets worse than the fear of doing it, it can feel like we're carrying around a giant tumor.

105
00:04:51,737 --> 00:04:54,521
When we walk in this door, you will maintain decorum.

106
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,545
You will not laugh, vomit, or drop your jaw.

107
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:58,245
We understood?

108
00:04:58,286 --> 00:05:00,028
Why would we laugh?

109
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:00,889
Oh, Jess, you wait.

110
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,651
Good morning, Miss Connors.

111
00:05:08,437 --> 00:05:08,697
Good morning.

112
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:09,398
What is it?

113
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:09,899
A tumor.

114
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,723
And you thought I was speaking metaphorically.

115
00:05:45,276 --> 00:05:46,077
Good morning, Annie.

116
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,319
How are you?

117
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:50,004
This is Dr. Bailey, and these are my fellow interns.

118
00:05:50,024 --> 00:05:53,949
Dr. Karev, we refer to patients as Mr. and... I told him to call me Annie.

119
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:59,398
Miss Connors makes me feel old and fat, which I am, but why feel that way?

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,541
Good morning.

121
00:06:02,081 --> 00:06:04,326
Oh, Annie, this is Dr. Burke.

122
00:06:04,346 --> 00:06:07,050
Awesome surgeon.

123
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:07,790
Dr. Karev?

124
00:06:08,362 --> 00:06:14,812
Oh, uh, Annie Connors is a 43-year-old woman who presented last night with progressive shortness of breath for the past three months.

125
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:21,122
Found to have a very large tumor of unknown origin pressed against her diaphragm.

126
00:06:21,684 --> 00:06:22,685
Stable vital signs.

127
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:24,028
Scheduled for CT this morning, sir.

128
00:06:24,528 --> 00:06:25,370
Thank you, Dr. Karef.

129
00:06:26,812 --> 00:06:28,314
Are you at all claustrophobic?

130
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:29,637
I've been housebound for the last year.

131
00:06:29,677 --> 00:06:31,180
How claustrophobic could I be?

132
00:06:32,088 --> 00:06:33,348
All right, then.

133
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:35,512
Dr. Stevens is going to take you for a CT.

134
00:06:35,891 --> 00:06:38,935
It'll give us a better look at the tumor, and we'll know how to proceed from there.

135
00:06:39,396 --> 00:06:40,637
Could someone tell my mom?

136
00:06:41,418 --> 00:06:43,281
She'll worry if she gets back and I'm not here.

137
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:44,281
Yeah, of course.

138
00:06:44,502 --> 00:06:44,862
Of course.

139
00:06:45,202 --> 00:06:48,326
And would it be possible for Alex to take me instead?

140
00:06:48,346 --> 00:06:55,194
I mean, he's just so fun to look at.

141
00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:56,095
Annie.

142
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,115
Sure.

143
00:06:57,136 --> 00:06:58,418
Sure, Miss Gars.

144
00:06:58,437 --> 00:07:00,339
Excuse me.

145
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,644
How much do you think it weighs?

146
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:04,446
60 pounds.

147
00:07:04,747 --> 00:07:05,007
More.

148
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:07,151
She's carrying around a whole extra person.

149
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,132
This one's going in the books.

150
00:07:08,593 --> 00:07:09,413
I've got to get in.

151
00:07:09,694 --> 00:07:10,235
I almost did.

152
00:07:10,815 --> 00:07:11,918
Have you ever seen Alex like that?

153
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,079
He actually seemed sincere.

154
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,682
Seemed being the operative word.

155
00:07:14,742 --> 00:07:16,125
He was on call last night when she came in.

156
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:18,007
I am never leaving this place again.

157
00:07:19,237 --> 00:07:20,718
Let's move, people.

158
00:07:20,738 --> 00:07:20,879
Ms.

159
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:29,471
Conna's surgery, should we choose to proceed, will take most, if not all, of the surgeons off the floor, which means you people will have to work extra hard not to kill anyone.

160
00:07:30,132 --> 00:07:31,815
And we won't be there to fix your mistakes.

161
00:07:32,295 --> 00:07:32,997
Dr. Burke?

162
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,802
Trauma team to OR1.

163
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:37,204
Trauma team to OR1.

164
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,185
I really want in on this.

165
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:40,908
I thought we weren't talking.

166
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:41,470
I'm not talking.

167
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,031
I'm just saying.

168
00:07:44,954 --> 00:07:48,180
Find her mother, get a family history, and tell Bailey.

169
00:07:50,877 --> 00:07:52,939
Mr. Harper had a coronary bypass yesterday.

170
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:55,262
His blood pressure currently 100 over 65.

171
00:07:55,802 --> 00:08:00,247
Was running low overnight, down to 70 over 30, but responded to medication.

172
00:08:00,807 --> 00:08:03,630
Post-operative labs show crit of 30 and normal coagulation.

173
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,394
Chest tube output has halted over the last two hours.

174
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:07,495
What's your plan?

175
00:08:08,016 --> 00:08:10,317
Chest X-ray and check the tube for possible occlusion.

176
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,079
Good.

177
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:12,581
He's doing fine.

178
00:08:14,302 --> 00:08:14,843
Thank you.

179
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:27,170
I know you think I like Meredith, but I don't like Meredith.

180
00:08:28,052 --> 00:08:28,252
What?

181
00:08:28,531 --> 00:08:29,574
No, I mean, I like Meredith.

182
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,416
I mean, obviously I like Meredith.

183
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:33,940
I just don't have that thing for her.

184
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,220
OK.

185
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:41,350
It's just this morning, you know, it's like, and I know you're probably just teasing, but I just don't want you to say anything like that to her, because, you know, we live together, and that would just be really awkward.

186
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,552
George, stop talking.

187
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:43,173
OK.

188
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,621
Morning.

189
00:08:51,610 --> 00:09:01,524
Mr. LaVangie, this is Dr. Bailey and our fine staff of surgical interns.

190
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:02,765
Welcome to hell, kids.

191
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,812
Who's presenting?

192
00:09:07,273 --> 00:09:11,698
Edward LaVangie is a 63-year-old man admitted for pain management for dyskinesia.

193
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,524
He's been stable since last night and responding well to the bolus injections.

194
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:17,394
Is he possible treatments?

195
00:09:17,414 --> 00:09:24,385
For Parkinson's disease, um, deep brain stimulation is shown very... Not for Parkinson's, for spinal pain.

196
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:28,011
Oh, um... Intraspinal catheter.

197
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:31,158
That way he can have constant pain medication.

198
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:32,340
Excellent.

199
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,721
Let's talk to Gray.

200
00:09:34,222 --> 00:09:36,385
She's gonna prep you for the procedure and assist.

201
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,073
Excuse me.

202
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:47,815
You make yourselves busy.

203
00:09:47,894 --> 00:09:48,775
I'll catch up with you.

204
00:09:58,072 --> 00:09:58,231
Miranda.

205
00:09:58,251 --> 00:09:58,653
Excuse me.

206
00:09:58,793 --> 00:10:06,686
Well, that's your name, right?

207
00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:11,594
It's on your jacket.

208
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:12,816
Fine, I'll just call you Bailey then.

209
00:10:12,981 --> 00:10:18,168
You think you're charming, and that talented, neurotic, overly-moosed-hair sort of way good for you.

210
00:10:18,688 --> 00:10:22,273
But if you think I'm gonna stand back and watch while you favor her... I don't favor her.

211
00:10:22,352 --> 00:10:22,813
She's good.

212
00:10:23,495 --> 00:10:24,296
She is.

213
00:10:24,635 --> 00:10:26,918
You know, can I point out that technically, I'm your boss.

214
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,159
You don't scare me.

215
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:33,086
Look, I'm not gonna advertise your extracurricular activities with my intern.

216
00:10:33,105 --> 00:10:38,732
However, the next time I see you favoring Meredith Grey in any way, I'll make sure she doesn't see the inside of an O.R.

217
00:10:38,832 --> 00:10:39,374
for a month.

218
00:10:40,554 --> 00:10:42,076
Just for the sake of balance.

219
00:10:45,753 --> 00:10:46,573
We're all set, doc.

220
00:10:46,594 --> 00:10:46,894
OK.

221
00:10:48,756 --> 00:10:53,222
Um, Annie, there's going to be a microphone in there for you in case you get scared or you want to get out.

222
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:58,230
But, you know, try not to do that, because then we're going to have to start all over again.

223
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:58,671
I'm fine.

224
00:10:59,371 --> 00:10:59,932
I'll be fine.

225
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:06,522
I know you're going to be fine, because I'm going to be right over there behind that glass waiting for you.

226
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:07,682
All right?

227
00:11:07,702 --> 00:11:07,763
OK.

228
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:08,124
You ready?

229
00:11:08,825 --> 00:11:09,645
Are you really ready?

230
00:11:10,506 --> 00:11:11,107
Let's do this.

231
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:12,570
See you.

232
00:11:21,325 --> 00:11:22,789
Oh, hey, man, you got an extra battery.

233
00:11:24,315 --> 00:11:25,158
Unbelievable.

234
00:11:26,743 --> 00:11:27,927
Oh, I know, right?

235
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:29,471
I've never seen anything like this.

236
00:11:29,532 --> 00:11:30,475
God.

237
00:11:31,822 --> 00:11:34,346
What I don't understand is how a person lets it get like that.

238
00:11:34,366 --> 00:11:38,053
I mean, man, that is a whole lot of nasty.

239
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:39,677
Maybe she's afraid of doctors.

240
00:11:40,498 --> 00:11:41,158
Poor thing.

241
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,562
Poor thing, please.

242
00:11:43,043 --> 00:11:44,806
If you're afraid of doctors, you should take a pill.

243
00:11:45,147 --> 00:11:48,072
She's just sick, like warped, you know?

244
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:52,259
Seriously, I don't know how she lives with herself.

245
00:11:57,184 --> 00:12:00,808
Well, at first, we thought she was just putting on weight.

246
00:12:00,828 --> 00:12:06,153
When we realized what was happening, I tried to get her to go to the doctor, but she was scared.

247
00:12:06,173 --> 00:12:09,357
And the bigger it got, the less she wanted to go.

248
00:12:09,378 --> 00:12:13,621
And she never really felt all that sick until last night.

249
00:12:14,743 --> 00:12:15,563
She couldn't breathe.

250
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,206
Because the tumor was crushing her lungs.

251
00:12:18,626 --> 00:12:20,149
Yes, well, I called 911.

252
00:12:20,288 --> 00:12:23,192
It just seemed like the right thing to do.

253
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:34,804
You know, the right thing to do would have been to call a year ago.

254
00:12:34,825 --> 00:12:35,184
Yes, thank you.

255
00:12:35,205 --> 00:12:36,386
Okay, Mr. Levangie.

256
00:12:38,431 --> 00:12:40,333
I'm gonna get you more comfortable, okay?

257
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:41,034
Uh-huh.

258
00:12:41,054 --> 00:12:43,658
I'm gonna go downstairs, and I'll be back up shortly.

259
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,025
Okay.

260
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:48,687
Okay.

261
00:12:49,028 --> 00:12:50,529
Excuse me.

262
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:53,264
I'm sorry, Dr. Gray.

263
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:55,047
My dad seems to like you.

264
00:12:55,086 --> 00:12:56,528
He's always liked skinny blondes.

265
00:12:57,711 --> 00:12:58,110
Is that rude?

266
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:58,451
I'm sorry.

267
00:12:58,471 --> 00:12:59,212
I'm so tired.

268
00:13:00,173 --> 00:13:00,754
Is there something?

269
00:13:00,774 --> 00:13:06,201
I was wondering if you would talk to him about brain surgery.

270
00:13:06,903 --> 00:13:09,446
The doctor mentioned it, and I've read about it online.

271
00:13:10,126 --> 00:13:13,631
If it worked, it could help with most of his symptoms, not just his pain.

272
00:13:14,354 --> 00:13:15,255
Is he a candidate?

273
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:16,899
I didn't... He is, but he's afraid of it.

274
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:25,035
Surgery on his back, he can understand, but his brain... And there are risks, but his quality of life... There isn't any.

275
00:13:26,698 --> 00:13:27,701
And it keeps getting worse.

276
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:31,328
I'm getting married next month.

277
00:13:32,191 --> 00:13:34,254
I already lost my mom.

278
00:13:34,274 --> 00:13:35,738
And I want him to walk...

279
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,201
I want him with me.

280
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:43,208
Maybe that's selfish, but you don't know what it's like having a parent.

281
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:45,292
Watching him.

282
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:47,235
I do.

283
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:49,620
I do know what it's like.

284
00:13:51,261 --> 00:13:52,063
I'll see what I can do.

285
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:53,806
Thanks.

286
00:13:54,807 --> 00:13:55,408
You're welcome.

287
00:13:56,871 --> 00:13:57,793
Thank you.

288
00:14:03,004 --> 00:14:06,808
The right hemidiaphragm is so high that it's completely displacing her lung tissue.

289
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,312
It's infiltrated her spinal canal in three places.

290
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:11,735
We should start there.

291
00:14:12,014 --> 00:14:14,677
It's going to take three, four hours just to get around those nerves.

292
00:14:14,697 --> 00:14:16,480
I'd prefer to start in front and then flip her.

293
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:20,184
You never know what kind of vessels are involved, how intertwined they are.

294
00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:21,605
I'm going to need a good head start.

295
00:14:21,966 --> 00:14:23,288
I should really go with the spine fresh.

296
00:14:23,548 --> 00:14:25,331
I miss a step, she's paralyzed.

297
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,513
If I don't relieve the pressure on her lungs, she'll be dead.

298
00:14:27,592 --> 00:14:29,895
So she won't mind if she can't walk.

299
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,677
You think she really wants to live?

300
00:14:32,317 --> 00:14:33,177
Come on.

301
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:34,559
She's been housebound.

302
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,486
She's been living under this thing, just watching it grow for how long?

303
00:14:39,168 --> 00:14:40,349
She doesn't seem stupid.

304
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,072
Doesn't even seem all that scared.

305
00:14:42,753 --> 00:14:45,157
Why would anyone wait this long unless they wanted to die?

306
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,460
People do things every day that they know could kill them.

307
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:49,583
Doesn't mean they want to die.

308
00:14:49,943 --> 00:14:51,687
What are her chances of surviving the surgery?

309
00:14:52,027 --> 00:14:54,291
Slightly better than if we do nothing.

310
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:55,172
So is it worth it?

311
00:14:57,075 --> 00:14:57,875
Hey, come on.

312
00:14:57,895 --> 00:14:58,878
You were already thinking it.

313
00:14:58,918 --> 00:14:59,538
I'm just saying.

314
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:02,006
She's 43.

315
00:15:02,206 --> 00:15:03,087
It's worth a try.

316
00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:12,061
Morning.

317
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:13,923
Dr. Moretti, 4672.

318
00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:15,745
Dr. Moretti, 4672.

319
00:15:16,346 --> 00:15:17,048
Dr. Shepherd.

320
00:15:17,087 --> 00:15:20,293
Mr. LaVangie, the Parkinson's patient.

321
00:15:20,894 --> 00:15:22,316
Is he a good candidate for DBS?

322
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,379
Yes, but he's not interested.

323
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,163
OK, but I think it's worth talking to him again, pushing him.

324
00:15:28,244 --> 00:15:29,525
We're talking about a brain surgery.

325
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:31,412
It is performed while the patient is wide awake.

326
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:35,696
There is a risk of paralysis, a risk of death, and the patient doesn't want it.

327
00:15:35,775 --> 00:15:38,958
It is not my job to push him into anything, and it's definitely not yours.

328
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:40,841
Okay.

329
00:15:40,921 --> 00:15:43,884
Since you're clearly uncomfortable with my decision in this case, it's probably best you don't scrub in.

330
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:45,284
But... It's a minor procedure.

331
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:46,005
You won't be missed.

332
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:57,336
You know, they call you the Nazi.

333
00:15:57,996 --> 00:15:58,837
So I've heard.

334
00:15:59,644 --> 00:16:06,152
I won't lie to you.

335
00:16:06,653 --> 00:16:08,715
The surgery is going to be long and difficult.

336
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,379
But we have an extremely capable surgical team, and I can't.

337
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,083
Am I going to die?

338
00:16:16,104 --> 00:16:17,144
There's always that risk.

339
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:19,226
But if we don't do the surgery.

340
00:16:20,969 --> 00:16:21,889
I'll definitely die.

341
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:22,971
Yes.

342
00:16:24,273 --> 00:16:24,614
Soon?

343
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:25,855
Yes.

344
00:16:29,496 --> 00:16:30,538
Mom, the room's clean.

345
00:16:30,678 --> 00:16:31,340
OK, Annie.

346
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:31,740
OK.

347
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:32,120
Mom.

348
00:16:33,462 --> 00:16:34,423
She'll have the surgery.

349
00:16:35,105 --> 00:16:35,566
Mom.

350
00:16:35,765 --> 00:16:36,005
No.

351
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:37,528
No, Annie.

352
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:39,932
She will have the surgery.

353
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,400
I guess I'll have the surgery.

354
00:16:47,102 --> 00:16:49,546
I think that is a very wise decision.

355
00:16:49,566 --> 00:16:50,326
On one condition.

356
00:16:51,168 --> 00:16:51,908
I don't want him there.

357
00:16:54,332 --> 00:16:55,855
I'm sorry, Annie.

358
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,116
Did I upset you in some way?

359
00:16:57,197 --> 00:16:59,200
If he's in the surgery, I'm not having it.

360
00:17:03,128 --> 00:17:04,230
That's how I live with myself.

361
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:07,256
OK, Miss Connors.

362
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:16,773
Dr. Karev.

363
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,162
What the hell did you do?

364
00:17:21,182 --> 00:17:21,643
Nothing.

365
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:22,855
I don't know.

366
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:25,038
Man, the mic must have been on.

367
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:25,919
I was talking to the tech guy.

368
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:30,525
If anything goes wrong, anything, you are 60% more likely to be sued if you've offended the patient.

369
00:17:30,944 --> 00:17:31,346
60%.

370
00:17:31,405 --> 00:17:32,646
I never would have said that stuff.

371
00:17:33,228 --> 00:17:34,348
The mic shouldn't have been on.

372
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:35,711
I didn't realize she could hear me.

373
00:17:36,372 --> 00:17:38,253
Well, now you won't realize your chance to scrub in.

374
00:17:38,615 --> 00:17:41,718
You're banned from the OR, mine or anyone else's, all week.

375
00:17:41,738 --> 00:17:42,700
I got the history on the tumor.

376
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:44,481
It's been growing for a year and a half.

377
00:17:45,343 --> 00:17:47,605
A year and a half, and it's the first time she's even had it looked at.

378
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:48,946
It's like she's fatally lazy.

379
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:54,848
Why doesn't she get banned?

380
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,333
Go prep Anna Connors for surgery.

381
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,575
You're scrubbing in with Christina.

382
00:17:59,615 --> 00:17:59,855
Really?

383
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:00,836
I mean, thank you.

384
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:02,598
Um, OK.

385
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,163
We just need to recheck your labs and get an EKG, so I just need to take a little blood.

386
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,848
Dr. Burke is great, and Dr. Bailey.

387
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,651
I know you're probably scared.

388
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:13,451
That's OK, kitten.

389
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:15,054
It can just do your job.

390
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:17,837
You don't have to talk to the fat, nasty tumor lady.

391
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:21,162
I mean, I let her get this bad, how much sympathy do I deserve?

392
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,010
Why did you let it get this bad?

393
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:31,180
I'm the first person since I got here to ask me that.

394
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,021
Well, I guess it's just like the elephant in the room.

395
00:18:33,663 --> 00:18:34,023
Elephant?

396
00:18:34,644 --> 00:18:37,689
I mean... It's more like a giant sow, don't you think?

397
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:47,182
Every time I went to the hospital, someone died.

398
00:18:47,241 --> 00:18:51,907
All four of my grandparents, then my dad.

399
00:18:52,630 --> 00:19:00,759
My best friend's mom, my baby sister, they all went in, never came out.

400
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:01,780
So I put it off.

401
00:19:05,905 --> 00:19:08,430
You know, you're not the only one to put things off.

402
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,571
I mean, I never do anything to the last possible minute.

403
00:19:11,452 --> 00:19:12,775
Like what?

404
00:19:12,795 --> 00:19:19,363
Well... I've had this thing from my roommate since, like, day one, and I just...

405
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:22,181
I can't tell her.

406
00:19:22,721 --> 00:19:29,692
You know, she probably wouldn't go out with me anyway, but how do I know that for sure if I don't ever ask?

407
00:19:32,076 --> 00:19:32,536
Seriously?

408
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,561
You're equating your pathetic love life with my record-breaking tumor.

409
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:38,945
Seriously.

410
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:47,778
It's just that he blatantly favors me in front of her and then blatantly dismisses me.

411
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,401
How do you know he was favoring you?

412
00:19:51,945 --> 00:19:52,866
Look, you've got a brain.

413
00:19:52,906 --> 00:19:54,028
You got into this program.

414
00:19:54,229 --> 00:19:57,993
Just because Shepard likes to munch your cookies doesn't mean that you didn't deserve what you work for.

415
00:19:58,013 --> 00:19:59,214
But he's making me look bad.

416
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:01,758
I have to end it.

417
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:03,000
Right.

418
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:04,382
It's over.

419
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:04,541
Uh-huh.

420
00:20:05,482 --> 00:20:07,586
Is it true you get to scrub in on that tumor?

421
00:20:07,885 --> 00:20:08,446
Don't sit here.

422
00:20:08,787 --> 00:20:09,708
You get to scrub in?

423
00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:11,631
How psyched are you?

424
00:20:11,651 --> 00:20:13,353
On a scale of one to ecstatic?

425
00:20:13,373 --> 00:20:13,633
Ecstatic?

426
00:20:13,653 --> 00:20:14,394
It's unbelievable.

427
00:20:14,954 --> 00:20:15,736
You know what I think?

428
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,118
I think Burke wants to get into your scrubs.

429
00:20:18,138 --> 00:20:19,000
Why are you sitting here?

430
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:22,314
to kick me off that surgery for the same crap you pull every day.

431
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:22,714
You know what?

432
00:20:22,974 --> 00:20:25,638
If I stuck this fork into his thigh, would I get in trouble?

433
00:20:25,939 --> 00:20:28,123
Not if you make it look like an accident.

434
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:28,542
Hey.

435
00:20:28,563 --> 00:20:29,284
Hi.

436
00:20:29,304 --> 00:20:30,286
Hey.

437
00:20:30,306 --> 00:20:30,425
Hello.

438
00:20:30,445 --> 00:20:31,227
Thank God, ma'am.

439
00:20:31,847 --> 00:20:33,631
I'm drowning in estrogen here.

440
00:20:33,651 --> 00:20:35,973
Look, uh, is everything OK?

441
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:38,919
Shepard's a jackass.

442
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:39,740
Really?

443
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,324
I think he's kind of great.

444
00:20:42,344 --> 00:20:43,424
You reamed her out when I bailed.

445
00:20:43,726 --> 00:20:43,965
Why?

446
00:20:44,707 --> 00:20:45,669
Because he's a jackass.

447
00:20:45,888 --> 00:20:45,949
Oh.

448
00:20:47,751 --> 00:20:50,214
Well, bad days are bad.

449
00:20:51,037 --> 00:20:54,781
Maybe tonight, uh, if you, you know, if you drink alcohol.

450
00:20:55,261 --> 00:20:59,528
I mean, we could, all of us, I mean, go out and drink alcohol.

451
00:21:00,288 --> 00:21:03,133
It wouldn't be because of the bad day.

452
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,460
Here you go.

453
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:14,868
Dude.

454
00:21:14,888 --> 00:21:15,430
Shut up.

455
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:29,477
How's your back?

456
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:30,337
Still good.

457
00:21:31,018 --> 00:21:31,117
Good.

458
00:21:31,138 --> 00:21:31,459
How are you?

459
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:32,420
Good.

460
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,340
Can you leave the board for me?

461
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:35,522
I just want to check something.

462
00:21:35,542 --> 00:21:37,685
Does that feel OK?

463
00:21:37,705 --> 00:21:37,806
Yeah.

464
00:21:37,826 --> 00:21:38,046
Right here?

465
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:38,646
Did you, Paige?

466
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:45,413
Mr. Navangi, have you given any more thought about the other surgical options we discussed this morning?

467
00:21:48,258 --> 00:21:48,357
What?

468
00:21:48,377 --> 00:21:49,038
Why would I?

469
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:50,819
I already told you, no.

470
00:21:52,201 --> 00:21:54,904
I'm letting you cut into my back.

471
00:21:54,924 --> 00:21:56,807
But that's not enough for you.

472
00:21:56,904 --> 00:21:58,946
All you guys ever want to do is cut.

473
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:00,469
Dad, just listen to what he has to say.

474
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:01,730
I already listened.

475
00:22:02,832 --> 00:22:05,474
Sir, there's a very small window of opportunity here.

476
00:22:06,214 --> 00:22:11,340
You know, once the Parkinson's progresses to a point of dementia, there's, you know, you're no longer a candidate for DBS.

477
00:22:11,361 --> 00:22:17,948
And when I'm no longer a candidate, is that when you people will leave me the hell alone?

478
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:25,696
What, do I have to start drooling and forget my name to get a little peace and quiet?

479
00:22:28,276 --> 00:22:29,176
I'll check back with you later.

480
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,560
Try to get some rest.

481
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,085
Dad, you're being unreasonable.

482
00:22:34,846 --> 00:22:36,528
The doctors are only trying to help you.

483
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:39,011
It's my damn life, and it's my damn brain.

484
00:22:39,653 --> 00:22:43,398
You want me to let them cut up my brain while I'm lying here awake?

485
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,260
For what?

486
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:44,681
Dad.

487
00:22:44,942 --> 00:22:46,083
I'll be at your wedding.

488
00:22:47,505 --> 00:22:48,507
I will sit in the back.

489
00:22:48,586 --> 00:22:50,670
Your uncle will walk you down the aisle.

490
00:22:52,492 --> 00:22:54,536
I know it's not perfect, but it's life.

491
00:22:55,317 --> 00:22:57,000
Life is messy sometimes.

492
00:22:58,718 --> 00:22:59,519
I know that.

493
00:22:59,538 --> 00:23:09,693
If she knows, then what the hell are we still talking for, huh?

494
00:23:10,934 --> 00:23:12,917
Why in hell can't she drop it?

495
00:23:17,124 --> 00:23:17,904
It is your life.

496
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:20,067
But it's her life, too.

497
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:22,592
And you have a chance to get better here.

498
00:23:22,632 --> 00:23:26,817
And all she's asking you to do is try.

499
00:23:35,692 --> 00:23:39,458
If they pull this off, I'm totally calling Oprah.

500
00:23:39,478 --> 00:23:40,499
You two been working out?

501
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:46,307
Um, sometimes I jog, and I try to take the stairs whenever possible.

502
00:23:46,327 --> 00:23:46,607
Why?

503
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:49,051
See that large pile of tumor?

504
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,376
You're going to be retracting it for the next 14 hours.

505
00:23:52,777 --> 00:23:55,080
I'm just saying, I hope you have strong backs.

506
00:23:58,846 --> 00:23:59,487
Dr. Shepherd.

507
00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:00,709
Yes?

508
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,993
Mr. LaVange has agreed to DBS.

509
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,641
If we do it today.

510
00:24:07,482 --> 00:24:08,644
If he leaves, he won't come back.

511
00:24:13,548 --> 00:24:15,609
Don't worry, Dr. Shepard.

512
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,511
It'll take hours before we get around to the spy.

513
00:24:18,272 --> 00:24:18,833
I'll page you.

514
00:24:21,015 --> 00:24:21,496
All right, then.

515
00:24:23,637 --> 00:24:23,877
Let's do it.

516
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:25,660
Dr. Cartwright needs ICU.

517
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:32,886
Dr. Cartwright needs ICU.

518
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:33,406
Dr. Bailey.

519
00:24:36,053 --> 00:24:40,398
I didn't know that he was my boss when I met him.

520
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:41,461
I didn't know.

521
00:24:41,641 --> 00:24:42,201
I don't care.

522
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:43,303
Really?

523
00:24:43,323 --> 00:24:44,525
Oh.

524
00:24:45,185 --> 00:24:49,811
He sort of seemed to not be talking to me, so I... You see this, what's happening right here?

525
00:24:49,832 --> 00:24:52,476
This is the problem with you sleeping with my boss.

526
00:24:53,196 --> 00:24:57,142
Not whether or not you knew him before, but how it affects my day.

527
00:24:57,923 --> 00:25:02,549
And me standing here talking to you about your sex life affects my day.

528
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:12,137
And the longer this little fling goes on, the more favors you get over the others who are fighting tooth and nail just to make it through this program without any assistance.

529
00:25:12,157 --> 00:25:25,349
When those people start finding out what's going on, and they don't want to work with you, and talk to you, or look at you, and they start bitching and moaning at me, the more it affects my day.

530
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:31,714
So no, Dr. Gray, I don't care what you knew or when you knew it.

531
00:25:31,734 --> 00:25:32,435
We understood.

532
00:25:34,204 --> 00:25:34,545
Yes.

533
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:48,202
Do it.

534
00:25:48,222 --> 00:25:48,943
This sucks.

535
00:25:49,523 --> 00:25:51,105
Yeah, well, I'm not a real fan of yours either.

536
00:25:51,306 --> 00:25:51,987
Not you this.

537
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:53,548
Everyone else is scrubbed in somewhere.

538
00:25:54,009 --> 00:25:54,450
Right side.

539
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,352
We have the room and the floor.

540
00:25:55,692 --> 00:25:56,212
Great.

541
00:25:56,232 --> 00:25:56,933
Want to do it in the stairwell?

542
00:25:57,433 --> 00:25:58,895
I'm just saying, you never know what could happen.

543
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:03,778
I'm changing.

544
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:05,299
I'll pet you if I need you.

545
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,520
You do that.

546
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:13,807
You're so my favorite person today.

547
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:19,031
We need to hang another bag of un-egg.

548
00:26:19,152 --> 00:26:22,894
I'm cauterizing the small bleeders to keep my visual field clean.

549
00:26:23,796 --> 00:26:26,077
God, is your bag killing you?

550
00:26:26,097 --> 00:26:27,499
George, shut up.

551
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,941
We're in here.

552
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:30,942
Hold it right there.

553
00:26:33,182 --> 00:26:36,367
Mrs. Harker, let me show you these chest films.

554
00:26:39,313 --> 00:26:47,768
We were able to relieve the obstruction of his chest tube, so the buildup of fluids you see here should resolve itself soon.

555
00:26:47,788 --> 00:26:49,750
Which translates as he should be home in no time.

556
00:26:50,732 --> 00:26:51,693
He was making waffles.

557
00:26:52,095 --> 00:26:52,516
I'm sorry?

558
00:26:53,356 --> 00:26:54,358
He was making waffles.

559
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:56,321
He was mixing the batter and...

560
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,873
And then he was on the floor.

561
00:26:58,192 --> 00:27:00,236
Izzy, we need a central line run in 204.

562
00:27:00,256 --> 00:27:01,277
Hey, Dr. Karev, will you?

563
00:27:01,298 --> 00:27:01,999
He's not answering.

564
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:03,961
I'm so sorry.

565
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:17,140
I'll be back.

566
00:27:17,161 --> 00:27:18,182
Like what you see, right?

567
00:27:25,692 --> 00:27:26,493
Neurosponge?

568
00:27:28,701 --> 00:27:29,863
How you doing, Mr. LaVangie?

569
00:27:30,503 --> 00:27:30,744
All right.

570
00:27:31,224 --> 00:27:32,046
Drill bit's charged.

571
00:27:33,067 --> 00:27:33,807
Where's Blondie?

572
00:27:34,368 --> 00:27:35,009
I'm right here.

573
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:35,990
Can you see me?

574
00:27:36,711 --> 00:27:37,373
I'm shaky.

575
00:27:37,413 --> 00:27:38,173
I'm not blind.

576
00:27:39,194 --> 00:27:41,458
If anything goes wrong here, I'm blaming you.

577
00:27:42,378 --> 00:27:42,720
Oh, OK.

578
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,723
In that case, I'll stay where you can see me.

579
00:27:45,743 --> 00:27:50,609
Now we just have to drill a hole and try to find the spot that controls the motor function.

580
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,751
I can't see my brain from there.

581
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,974
Aren't you supposed to be learning something?

582
00:27:54,994 --> 00:27:56,396
I'm good right here.

583
00:27:58,384 --> 00:28:00,907
OK, Mr. LaVangie.

584
00:28:01,008 --> 00:28:02,189
Just take a couple deep breaths.

585
00:28:02,528 --> 00:28:03,490
Focus on the pretty girl.

586
00:28:05,373 --> 00:28:08,015
OK, this is going to sound really scary, but try and relax.

587
00:28:08,536 --> 00:28:11,378
You shouldn't feel a thing.

588
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:11,940
Any pain here?

589
00:28:13,121 --> 00:28:13,181
No.

590
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:15,864
Here?

591
00:28:15,884 --> 00:28:15,983
OK.

592
00:28:16,003 --> 00:28:18,446
Dr. Stevens, I need you to check the x-ray in 2103.

593
00:28:18,467 --> 00:28:20,368
2118 needs post-op notes.

594
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:23,311
And Jane's wondering if you want her to start feeding 2112.

595
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,431
I'm going on break.

596
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,515
Okay, yeah, um, before you do that, could you page Dr. Karev again?

597
00:28:27,736 --> 00:28:28,376
I already paged him.

598
00:28:28,396 --> 00:28:28,717
Yeah, again.

599
00:28:28,737 --> 00:28:32,021
A little more pressure.

600
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:34,085
That's good.

601
00:28:34,105 --> 00:28:34,846
Hold it right there.

602
00:28:34,865 --> 00:28:35,866
Long and slow.

603
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:37,368
I don't envy those two.

604
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,593
They've been holding that thing for eight hours.

605
00:28:40,192 --> 00:28:41,836
Their arms have to be ready to fall off.

606
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:46,643
Look at the size of this artery.

607
00:28:47,523 --> 00:28:48,365
My God.

608
00:28:49,165 --> 00:28:50,548
It's as thick as a thumb.

609
00:28:51,962 --> 00:28:53,585
You ever seen a vessel this size?

610
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:54,905
No.

611
00:28:56,748 --> 00:28:58,650
This thing is feeding on all our blood.

612
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,053
We need more O negative.

613
00:29:02,354 --> 00:29:03,154
I'll call the blood bank.

614
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:07,660
Damn it, O'Malley.

615
00:29:08,661 --> 00:29:09,821
Do you want me to kill this patient?

616
00:29:09,922 --> 00:29:10,663
No, I'm sorry.

617
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:13,925
I mean, is the auto retracting just too much for you?

618
00:29:13,945 --> 00:29:19,471
No, I was, uh, uh, I had an itch.

619
00:29:21,747 --> 00:29:23,028
Way to go, George.

620
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:24,269
Nicely done.

621
00:29:26,413 --> 00:29:28,214
Just keep trying, Mr. LaVangie.

622
00:29:28,695 --> 00:29:29,737
Mimic my motions.

623
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:31,219
You can do it.

624
00:29:32,641 --> 00:29:34,343
You're doing great, Mr. LaVangie.

625
00:29:34,923 --> 00:29:35,925
Just a little longer.

626
00:29:36,205 --> 00:29:41,353
Take a breath and try again.

627
00:29:41,393 --> 00:29:44,817
One more time, Mr. LaVangie.

628
00:29:44,836 --> 00:29:45,959
The probe is almost in.

629
00:29:46,598 --> 00:29:48,582
You'll know it when we find the right spot.

630
00:30:00,391 --> 00:30:01,856
Well, how about that?

631
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,449
There it is.

632
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,317
I'll be a cinema bitch.

633
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,172
Bailey was on the warpath and was trying to protect you.

634
00:30:18,653 --> 00:30:21,296
You trying to protect me is why she's on the warpath.

635
00:30:21,316 --> 00:30:22,576
You can't do me favors.

636
00:30:22,998 --> 00:30:25,099
You can't ask me to scrub in when I haven't earned it.

637
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:25,220
Okay.

638
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,121
Okay.

639
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:28,644
And you can't treat me like crap when I haven't earned that either.

640
00:30:28,884 --> 00:30:28,983
Okay.

641
00:30:29,003 --> 00:30:30,266
I can take care of myself.

642
00:30:30,865 --> 00:30:34,309
I got myself into this mess and I... And you'll get yourself out?

643
00:30:34,911 --> 00:30:37,313
I don't... know that yet.

644
00:30:42,618 --> 00:30:43,519
Don't let me keep you.

645
00:30:43,941 --> 00:30:45,061
You did great work here today.

646
00:30:48,451 --> 00:30:49,211
Dr. Shepard.

647
00:30:49,893 --> 00:30:51,817
Yeah.

648
00:30:51,957 --> 00:30:53,378
Sorry I called you a jackass.

649
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,421
You didn't.

650
00:30:54,441 --> 00:30:55,502
I did.

651
00:30:56,284 --> 00:30:56,684
Twice.

652
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,153
Tell you what, Blondie.

653
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:03,777
If you don't marry him, I will.

654
00:31:19,635 --> 00:31:21,979
No, no, no, Jimmy.

655
00:31:22,219 --> 00:31:23,922
No, no, Jimmy, no.

656
00:31:23,942 --> 00:31:29,690
We got pressure plummeted to 64 over 22, and he has runs of V-tech that aren't perfusing CVPs sky high.

657
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,289
Give him dopamine.

658
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:31,112
10 mics.

659
00:31:31,211 --> 00:31:32,053
He's already maxed out.

660
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:34,015
The resident was here an hour ago, but I can't reach him now.

661
00:31:34,256 --> 00:31:34,916
Of course.

662
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:35,877
Of course you can't.

663
00:31:36,157 --> 00:31:37,980
What is the matter with you?

664
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,421
Get her out of here.

665
00:31:38,441 --> 00:31:38,602
No.

666
00:31:38,642 --> 00:31:38,902
Ma'am.

667
00:31:39,162 --> 00:31:40,785
Mrs. Harper, you have to get out of here.

668
00:31:40,805 --> 00:31:41,005
Ma'am.

669
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:44,509
I'm thinking I have myocardial ischemia.

670
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:45,451
No, it's a clot.

671
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:45,790
Pick one.

672
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:46,432
Page someone.

673
00:31:46,451 --> 00:31:47,093
Page anyone.

674
00:31:47,133 --> 00:31:48,115
It's top or not.

675
00:31:48,134 --> 00:31:48,494
You'll be dead.

676
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:52,082
You have to open him up right here, right now.

677
00:31:53,064 --> 00:31:54,667
You said he was okay.

678
00:31:54,807 --> 00:31:56,751
Get out of here now!

679
00:31:56,771 --> 00:31:57,093
You have to cut.

680
00:31:57,113 --> 00:31:57,713
I can't.

681
00:31:57,733 --> 00:31:58,915
I've never even seen it done.

682
00:31:58,955 --> 00:31:59,817
I could kill him.

683
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:00,199
Do nothing.

684
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:01,080
You'll kill him faster.

685
00:32:01,101 --> 00:32:01,942
What's your glove size?

686
00:32:02,063 --> 00:32:02,363
Six.

687
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:04,728
Oh, God.

688
00:32:04,748 --> 00:32:06,290
Take a breath, Dr. Stevens.

689
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:07,713
She has to move over there.

690
00:32:08,335 --> 00:32:09,116
Walter, move out of the way.

691
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:16,239
Cut the stitches and then the staples.

692
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:17,861
Don't let them fall into the chest cavity.

693
00:32:17,921 --> 00:32:18,101
Wait.

694
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:27,990
I've never cracked a chest before.

695
00:32:28,009 --> 00:32:28,170
Oh, god.

696
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:28,349
Oh, god.

697
00:32:28,369 --> 00:32:28,851
No pulse.

698
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,172
Light complex rhythm.

699
00:32:30,632 --> 00:32:31,452
I can't get this clot out.

700
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:32,294
I need more suction.

701
00:32:32,314 --> 00:32:32,814
I need more.

702
00:32:33,153 --> 00:32:33,994
He's brady and down.

703
00:32:34,715 --> 00:32:36,116
You have to get the clot out.

704
00:32:36,136 --> 00:32:38,980
I can't get it.

705
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:40,441
Screw it.

706
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:41,701
I'm using my hand.

707
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:49,123
The size of that heart.

708
00:32:49,143 --> 00:32:50,003
Anything?

709
00:32:50,023 --> 00:32:50,223
No.

710
00:32:51,444 --> 00:33:05,781
You have to massage the heart, doctor.

711
00:33:05,801 --> 00:33:05,961
Come on.

712
00:33:05,981 --> 00:33:06,143
Come on.

713
00:33:06,163 --> 00:33:07,403
Come on, please.

714
00:33:07,423 --> 00:33:08,965
Come on, Mr. Harper.

715
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:09,866
We have a pulse.

716
00:33:20,106 --> 00:33:23,410
How's it going?

717
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:26,192
It's more intertwined than the studies made it look.

718
00:33:26,211 --> 00:33:33,038
I'm down ten units of blood, and I haven't even flipped it yet.

719
00:33:33,618 --> 00:33:34,078
Oh, wow.

720
00:33:38,002 --> 00:33:42,165
Look at that.

721
00:33:42,185 --> 00:33:44,228
Now, how am I supposed to get around that artery?

722
00:33:45,028 --> 00:33:48,612
We'll get...

723
00:33:49,672 --> 00:33:51,153
Uh, right then.

724
00:33:51,173 --> 00:33:52,015
Uh, forceps.

725
00:33:52,536 --> 00:33:56,621
There you go.

726
00:33:56,641 --> 00:33:57,001
Excuse me.

727
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:00,266
God, it's unbelievable.

728
00:34:00,626 --> 00:34:00,906
Right?

729
00:34:02,148 --> 00:34:03,631
How did she live like that?

730
00:34:04,731 --> 00:34:05,492
Watch what you say.

731
00:34:05,512 --> 00:34:06,374
You never know who's listening.

732
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:09,978
Look at George.

733
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,581
Looks like he's about to fall in.

734
00:34:14,525 --> 00:34:16,708
Are you really as shallow and callous as you seem?

735
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:21,706
Oh, you want to go out for a drink later and hear about my secret pain?

736
00:34:22,568 --> 00:34:23,989
Does that line ever work for you?

737
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,132
Sometimes.

738
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:29,257
Must be because you look like that.

739
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,983
Like what?

740
00:34:33,784 --> 00:34:34,525
So is that a yes?

741
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:36,168
No.

742
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,050
I can't.

743
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:40,074
I'm seeing someone.

744
00:34:40,094 --> 00:34:41,655
Look, you don't want to go out with me.

745
00:34:41,675 --> 00:34:42,418
Just say so.

746
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,079
No need to lie.

747
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:48,494
I don't want to go out with you.

748
00:34:49,996 --> 00:34:52,699
But I think I really might be seeing someone.

749
00:34:56,422 --> 00:34:57,923
No, we're OK.

750
00:34:58,143 --> 00:34:59,746
We're still in the middle of surgery.

751
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,188
Mr. Harper, the post-op heart patient at 2114.

752
00:35:02,889 --> 00:35:04,331
I had to open Mr. Anonymy bedside.

753
00:35:04,351 --> 00:35:05,873
What?

754
00:35:05,893 --> 00:35:06,152
What?

755
00:35:06,472 --> 00:35:06,793
What?

756
00:35:07,393 --> 00:35:07,875
What?

757
00:35:07,894 --> 00:35:10,197
He had cardiac tamponade.

758
00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:11,958
His chest films were clean this morning.

759
00:35:12,018 --> 00:35:13,701
It's just it happened fast.

760
00:35:13,721 --> 00:35:14,422
He was in PEA.

761
00:35:14,442 --> 00:35:15,382
There was no time.

762
00:35:17,572 --> 00:35:18,313
Go ahead, I got it.

763
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:20,695
We're OK here.

764
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:21,998
Book it.

765
00:35:22,018 --> 00:35:22,798
Yeah, I need some retractions.

766
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:24,059
Pull back on the retractor.

767
00:35:25,862 --> 00:35:28,123
You opened a heart bedside and you couldn't even page me?

768
00:35:28,664 --> 00:35:30,827
But needed all the glory for yourself, right?

769
00:35:30,847 --> 00:35:32,309
I paged you 50 times.

770
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:34,190
Do you have any idea what I've been through?

771
00:35:36,072 --> 00:35:36,713
Oh, man.

772
00:35:37,514 --> 00:35:38,835
The battery, I forgot to change it.

773
00:35:39,175 --> 00:35:39,797
You forgot?

774
00:35:39,876 --> 00:35:41,478
You forgot?

775
00:35:41,518 --> 00:35:42,619
You are hateful.

776
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:47,125
You are hateful, hateful, lazy, arrogant, hateful man.

777
00:35:49,518 --> 00:35:51,943
Ever a dull moment here at Seattle Grants?

778
00:35:51,963 --> 00:35:52,664
Oh!

779
00:35:52,826 --> 00:35:53,487
Oh, my God.

780
00:35:53,586 --> 00:35:54,068
Oh, goodness.

781
00:35:54,108 --> 00:35:54,670
Get right in there.

782
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,711
Get it close.

783
00:35:55,731 --> 00:35:56,894
Give me a clamp.

784
00:35:57,175 --> 00:35:58,057
We need more blood.

785
00:35:58,077 --> 00:35:58,940
Give me some suction here.

786
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,862
I can't see what I'm doing.

787
00:36:00,182 --> 00:36:02,126
Clamp, clamp, clamp, clamp, please.

788
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,523
Is there any blood in the rapid infuser?

789
00:36:08,822 --> 00:36:09,623
We're waiting on two units.

790
00:36:09,643 --> 00:36:10,545
What do you mean you're waiting?

791
00:36:10,784 --> 00:36:13,487
Well, we didn't anticipate this much blood last night.

792
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:14,668
We prepped a double supply.

793
00:36:14,688 --> 00:36:15,449
We've used it all.

794
00:36:15,469 --> 00:36:16,090
What did you cut?

795
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:16,630
Nothing.

796
00:36:16,891 --> 00:36:17,871
It just blew.

797
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,213
She came in with too much damage.

798
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:22,416
The artery walls are too weak.

799
00:36:22,795 --> 00:36:25,079
She's tested for 10 units of O negative.

800
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:25,498
Here.

801
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:26,679
Can I see?

802
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:27,000
What's this?

803
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:28,001
George, give me your hand.

804
00:36:28,081 --> 00:36:28,961
Push right down here.

805
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:29,543
Pull it towards you.

806
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:30,324
Suction.

807
00:36:30,443 --> 00:36:30,744
Suction.

808
00:36:30,764 --> 00:36:31,445
Pressure's dropping.

809
00:36:31,864 --> 00:36:32,545
She needs blood.

810
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,766
Where the hell is the blood?

811
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:53,996
Just squeeze it off right there.

812
00:36:54,016 --> 00:36:55,197
Is that O negative for R1?

813
00:36:56,018 --> 00:36:56,159
Uh-huh.

814
00:36:56,219 --> 00:36:56,719
O R1.

815
00:36:56,818 --> 00:36:57,139
O R1, right?

816
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:57,880
Yeah.

817
00:36:58,001 --> 00:37:01,985
I got it.

818
00:37:02,005 --> 00:37:02,184
I got it.

819
00:37:02,204 --> 00:37:03,126
Some suction, please.

820
00:37:03,146 --> 00:37:03,726
In here now.

821
00:37:03,746 --> 00:37:05,969
Come on.

822
00:37:06,009 --> 00:37:07,210
We're losing her now.

823
00:37:07,471 --> 00:37:07,731
Look at this.

824
00:37:07,751 --> 00:37:08,012
Look at this.

825
00:37:08,032 --> 00:37:08,411
Come on.

826
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,224
Oh, come on.

827
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:26,771
Come on.

828
00:37:56,688 --> 00:37:59,356
Time of death is 1142.

829
00:38:40,106 --> 00:38:43,490
The early bird catches the worm.

830
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,612
A stitch in time saves nine.

831
00:38:47,856 --> 00:38:48,175
Messy.

832
00:38:49,197 --> 00:38:49,757
I'm sorry.

833
00:38:50,137 --> 00:38:50,938
Don't be.

834
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:54,402
You saved this life.

835
00:38:56,105 --> 00:39:01,871
You found all the words you need.

836
00:39:01,891 --> 00:39:04,014
He who hesitates is lost.

837
00:39:04,494 --> 00:39:08,358
I just grumble.

838
00:39:09,706 --> 00:39:19,697
We can't pretend we haven't been told.

839
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:31,990
We've all heard the proverbs, heard the philosophers, heard our grandparents warning us about wasted time, heard the damn poets urging us to seize the day.

840
00:39:32,032 --> 00:39:39,460
Still, sometimes, we have to see for ourselves.

841
00:39:45,498 --> 00:39:54,427
I'm not doing you any more favors.

842
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:56,869
This was it.

843
00:39:56,889 --> 00:40:00,271
I have been holding up 50 pounds of tumor for the past 12 hours.

844
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:03,715
My back's gonna need traction, and the patient died anyways.

845
00:40:04,155 --> 00:40:05,717
You think you did me a favor?

846
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:11,302
Look, I'm just... What is this?

847
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,141
that we're doing here.

848
00:40:16,161 --> 00:40:21,065
What is it?

849
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,148
You need a definition?

850
00:40:22,168 --> 00:40:29,615
You really want to be that guy.

851
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,518
We have to make our own mistakes.

852
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,561
Lock the door.

853
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:39,967
We have to learn our own lessons.

854
00:40:41,088 --> 00:40:42,150
Have you seen Meredith?

855
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:44,835
Save yourself the misery, man.

856
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:45,916
She's off the market.

857
00:40:46,016 --> 00:40:46,217
What?

858
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:47,559
No, that's not.

859
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,460
We're just friends.

860
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:49,822
Whatever.

861
00:40:50,422 --> 00:40:50,983
But she's not.

862
00:40:51,003 --> 00:40:52,945
I mean, if she was seeing someone, I live with her.

863
00:40:53,045 --> 00:40:53,586
I would know it.

864
00:41:04,201 --> 00:41:13,132
We have to sweep today's possibility under tomorrow's rug until we can't anymore, until we finally understand for ourselves

865
00:41:13,467 --> 00:41:16,409
what Benjamin Franklin meant.

866
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:20,534
That knowing is better than wondering.

867
00:41:21,175 --> 00:41:33,331
That waking is better than sleeping.

868
00:41:33,811 --> 00:41:42,141
I know this place where there's an amazing view of sunrise over the ferry boats.

869
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,893
I have a thing for fairy boats.

870
00:41:48,655 --> 00:42:00,914
I remember.

871
00:42:01,856 --> 00:42:10,608
And that even the biggest failure, even the worst, most intractable mistake, beats the hell out of never trying.

872
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:16,650
Thank you.
