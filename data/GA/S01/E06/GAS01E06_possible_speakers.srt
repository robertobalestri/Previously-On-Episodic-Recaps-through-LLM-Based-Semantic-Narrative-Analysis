Meredith Grey / Mr. LaVangie OR Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I don't know why we put things off, but if I had to guess, I'd say it has a lot to do with fear.

31
00:01:25,432 --> 00:01:29,960

46
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:21,699
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Sometimes the fear is just of making a decision.

47
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:26,628
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Because what if you're wrong?

48
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,572
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): What if you're making a mistake you can't undo?

49

54
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,383

58
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:45,288

59
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:47,228

63
00:02:52,895 --> 00:02:54,115

64
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,170

65
00:02:57,352 --> 00:02:57,831

66
00:02:57,853 --> 00:03:01,574

67
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:02,858

68
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:05,901

73
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:23,157
Meredith / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): That was definitely worth being late.

74
00:03:29,431 --> 00:03:33,359

79
00:03:53,146 --> 00:03:54,288

80
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:55,789

81
00:03:55,872 --> 00:03:56,331

82
00:03:56,352 --> 00:03:57,274

Cristina / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): He's her boss, too.

84
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:01,051

85
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:01,372
Cristina / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): No.

86
00:04:02,955 --> 00:04:03,496

87
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:12,066
Cristina / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): He'll just get edged out, blacklisted, banned from his surgeries, passed over for chief resident.

88
00:04:13,508 --> 00:04:15,389
Cristina / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): It'll be humiliating, but he'll live.

89
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:16,790

93
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:25,882
Meredith / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): What?

94
00:04:27,314 --> 00:04:29,278

95
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:30,338
Cristina / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Oh, please.

96
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,526
Cristina / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Even a hot doctor likes to make you open up and say, ah.

97
00:04:33,547 --> 00:04:34,329
Alex Karev / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): It's an American dream.

98
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:35,271

99
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:36,192

100
00:04:36,293 --> 00:04:38,276

101
00:04:38,297 --> 00:04:39,158
Dr. Miranda Bailey: Christina, you're late.

102
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,240
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): So is Meredith.

103
00:04:41,103 --> 00:04:44,310
Dr. Meredith Grey: Whatever it is we're afraid of, one thing holds true.

104
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:51,718
Dr. Meredith Grey: that by the time the pain of not doing a thing gets worse than the fear of doing it, it can feel like we're carrying around a giant tumor.

105
00:04:51,737 --> 00:04:54,521
Dr. Miranda Bailey: When we walk in this door, you will maintain decorum.

106
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,545
Dr. Miranda Bailey: You will not laugh, vomit, or drop your jaw.

107
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:58,245
Dr. Miranda Bailey: We understood?

108
00:04:58,286 --> 00:05:00,028
Izzie Stevens / Dr. Alex Karev OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Why would we laugh?

109
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:00,889
Alex Karev / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): Oh, Jess, you wait.

110

112
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:09,398

113
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:09,899
Miranda Bailey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): A tumor.

114
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,723
Dr. Miranda Bailey: And you thought I was speaking metaphorically.

115
00:05:45,276 --> 00:05:46,076

116

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,540
Dr. Burke / Annie Connors (PVM): Good morning.

121
00:06:02,081 --> 00:06:04,326

123
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:07,790

129
00:06:26,812 --> 00:06:28,314

130
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:29,637
Annie Connors: I've been housebound for the last year.

131
00:06:29,677 --> 00:06:31,180

132
00:06:32,088 --> 00:06:33,348

141
00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:56,095

209
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,168

Dr. Derek Shepherd / Annie Connors OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): But, you know, try not to do that, because then we're going to have to start all over again.

223
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:58,671
Annie (the patient) / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): I'm fine.

231
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:12,570

232
00:11:21,325 --> 00:11:22,788

233
00:11:24,315 --> 00:11:25,158

237
00:11:31,822 --> 00:11:34,346

238
00:11:34,365 --> 00:11:38,052
Dr. Alex Karev / Annie Connors (PVM): I mean, man, that is a whole lot of nasty.

239
00:11:38,452 --> 00:11:39,677
Dr. George O'Malley / Annie Connors (PVM): Maybe she's afraid of doctors.

240
00:11:40,498 --> 00:11:41,158
Dr. George O'Malley / Annie Connors (PVM): Poor thing.

241
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,562

242
00:11:43,043 --> 00:11:44,806

247
00:12:06,173 --> 00:12:09,356

248
00:12:09,378 --> 00:12:13,620

249
00:12:14,743 --> 00:12:15,562

250
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,206

271
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:13,630
Family Member (likely Annie's relative) / Mr. LaVangie's Daughter (PVM): If it worked, it could help with most of his symptoms, not just his pain.

272
00:13:14,354 --> 00:13:15,254

280
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,207
Family Member (likely Annie's relative) / Mr. LaVangie's Daughter OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Maybe that's selfish, but you don't know what it's like having a parent.

281
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:45,292
Family Member (likely Annie's relative) / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Watching him.

282
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:47,235
Intern 1 or Doctor / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I do.

283
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:49,620
Intern 1 or Doctor / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I do know what it's like.

284
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,062
Intern 1 or Doctor / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I'll see what I can do.

285
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:53,806
Family Member (likely Annie's relative) / Mr. LaVangie's Daughter (PVM): Thanks.

286
00:13:54,807 --> 00:13:55,408
Intern 1 or Doctor / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): You're welcome.

287
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,793
Family Member (likely Annie's relative) / Unknown (PVM): Thank you.

288
00:14:03,004 --> 00:14:06,807
Intern 1 / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): The right hemidiaphragm is so high that it's completely displacing her lung tissue.

289
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,312
Surgeon 1 / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): It's infiltrated her spinal canal in three places.

290
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:11,735
Surgeon 2 / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): We should start there.

291
00:14:12,014 --> 00:14:14,677
Surgeon 1 / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): It's going to take three, four hours just to get around those nerves.

292
00:14:14,697 --> 00:14:16,480
Surgeon 2 / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I'd prefer to start in front and then flip her.

293
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:20,183
Surgeon 1 / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): You never know what kind of vessels are involved, how intertwined they are.

294
00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:21,605
Surgeon 2 / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I'm going to need a good head start.

295
00:14:21,966 --> 00:14:23,288
Surgeon 1 / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I should really go with the spine fresh.

296
00:14:23,548 --> 00:14:25,331
Surgeon 1 / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I miss a step, she's paralyzed.

297
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,513
Surgeon 2 / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): If I don't relieve the pressure on her lungs, she'll be dead.

298
00:14:27,591 --> 00:14:29,894
Surgeon 1 / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): So she won't mind if she can't walk.

299
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,677
Surgeon 2 / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): You think she really wants to live?

300
00:14:32,317 --> 00:14:33,177
Surgeon 1 / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Come on.

301
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:34,558
Surgeon 2 / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): She's been housebound.

302
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,485
Surgeon 2 / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): She's been living under this thing, just watching it grow for how long?

303
00:14:39,168 --> 00:14:40,349
Surgeon 1 / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): She doesn't seem stupid.

304
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,072
Surgeon 1 / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Doesn't even seem all that scared.

305
00:14:42,753 --> 00:14:45,157
Surgeon 2 / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Why would anyone wait this long unless they wanted to die?

306
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,460
Surgeon 1 / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): People do things every day that they know could kill them.

307
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,582
Surgeon 2 / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Doesn't mean they want to die.

308
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:51,687
Surgeon 1 / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): What are her chances of surviving the surgery?

309
00:14:52,027 --> 00:14:54,290
Surgeon 2 / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Slightly better than if we do nothing.

310
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:55,172
Surgeon 1 / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): So is it worth it?

311
00:14:57,075 --> 00:14:57,875
Surgeon 2 / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Hey, come on.

312
00:14:57,894 --> 00:14:58,878
Surgeon 2 / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): You were already thinking it.

313
00:14:58,918 --> 00:14:59,538
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I'm just saying.

314
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:02,005
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): She's 43.

315
00:15:02,206 --> 00:15:03,086
Unknown / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): It's worth a try.

316
00:15:07,052 --> 00:15:12,061
Meredith Grey / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Morning.

317
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:13,923
Hospital Intercom / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Dr. Moretti, 4672.

318
00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:15,745
Hospital Intercom / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Dr. Moretti, 4672.

319
00:15:16,346 --> 00:15:17,048
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Dr. Shepherd.

320
00:15:17,086 --> 00:15:20,293
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Mr. LaVangie, the Parkinson's patient.

321
00:15:20,894 --> 00:15:22,316
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Is he a good candidate for DBS?

322
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,379
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Yes, but he's not interested.

323
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,163
Meredith Grey / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): OK, but I think it's worth talking to him again, pushing him.

324
00:15:28,244 --> 00:15:29,524
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): We're talking about a brain surgery.

325
00:15:29,808 --> 00:15:31,412
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): It is performed while the patient is wide awake.

326
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:35,696
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd OR Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): There is a risk of paralysis, a risk of death, and the patient doesn't want it.

327
00:15:35,774 --> 00:15:38,957
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): It is not my job to push him into anything, and it's definitely not yours.

328
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:40,841
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Okay.

329
00:15:40,921 --> 00:15:43,884
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): Since you're clearly uncomfortable with my decision in this case, it's probably best you don't scrub in.

330
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:45,283
Meredith Grey / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): But... It's a minor procedure.

331
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:46,004
Derek Shepherd / Dr. Derek Shepherd (PVM): You won't be missed.

332
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:57,336
Meredith Grey / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You know, they call you the Nazi.

333
00:15:57,995 --> 00:15:58,836
Derek Shepherd / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): So I've heard.

334
00:15:59,644 --> 00:16:06,152
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Mr. LaVangie's Daughter (PVM): I won't lie to you.

335
00:16:06,653 --> 00:16:08,715
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): The surgery is going to be long and difficult.

336
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,379
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Annie Connors (PVM): But we have an extremely capable surgical team, and I can't.

337
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,082
Annie Connors: Am I going to die?

338
00:16:16,104 --> 00:16:17,144
Surgeon / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): There's always that risk.

339
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:19,225
Surgeon / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): But if we don't do the surgery.

340
00:16:20,969 --> 00:16:21,889
Annie Connors: I'll definitely die.

341
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:22,971
Surgeon / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Yes.

342
00:16:24,273 --> 00:16:24,614
Annie Connors: Soon?

343
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:25,855
Surgeon / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Yes.

344
00:16:29,495 --> 00:16:30,538
Annie's Child / Annie Connors (PVM): Mom, the room's clean.

345
00:16:30,677 --> 00:16:31,340
Annie / Dr. Miranda Bailey OR Annie Connors (PVM): OK, Annie.

346
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:31,740
Annie's Child / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): OK.

347
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:32,120
Annie's Child / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Mom.

348
00:16:33,461 --> 00:16:34,423
Annie's Mother / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): She'll have the surgery.

349
00:16:35,105 --> 00:16:35,566
Annie's Child / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Mom.

350
00:16:35,764 --> 00:16:36,004
Annie / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): No.

351
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:37,528
Annie's Mother / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): No, Annie.

352
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:39,932
Annie's Mother / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): She will have the surgery.

353
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,399
Annie Connors: I guess I'll have the surgery.

354
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:49,546
Surgeon / Annie Connors OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I think that is a very wise decision.

355
00:16:49,566 --> 00:16:50,326
Annie Connors: On one condition.

356
00:16:51,168 --> 00:16:51,908
Annie Connors: I don't want him there.

357
00:16:54,331 --> 00:16:55,855
Surgeon (the one Annie doesn't want) / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): I'm sorry, Annie.

358
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,115
Surgeon (the one Annie doesn't want) / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): Did I upset you in some way?

359
00:16:57,197 --> 00:16:59,200
Annie Connors: If he's in the surgery, I'm not having it.

360
00:17:03,128 --> 00:17:04,230
Surgeon (the one Annie doesn't want) / Annie Connors (PVM): That's how I live with myself.

361
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,256
Dr. Karev / Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): OK, Miss Connors.

362
00:17:09,358 --> 00:17:16,772
Unidentified Speaker / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Dr. Karev.

363
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,162
Dr. Karev / Annie Connors OR Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): What the hell did you do?

364
00:17:21,182 --> 00:17:21,643
Meredith Grey / Dr. Miranda Bailey (PVM): Nothing.

365
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:22,855
Cristina Yang / Annie Connors OR Dr. Alex Karev (PVM): I don't know.

366
00:17:23,655 --> 00:17:25,038
Dr. Karev / Annie Connors (PVM): Man, the mic must have been on.

367
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:25,919
Meredith Grey / Annie Connors OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I was talking to the tech guy.

368
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:30,525
Dr. Bailey / Annie Connors OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): If anything goes wrong, anything, you are 60% more likely to be sued if you've offended the patient.

369
00:17:30,943 --> 00:17:31,346
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): 60%.

370
00:17:31,404 --> 00:17:32,645
Meredith Grey / Annie Connors OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I never would have said that stuff.

371
00:17:33,228 --> 00:17:34,347
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): The mic shouldn't have been on.

372
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:35,711
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I didn't realize she could hear me.

373
00:17:36,372 --> 00:17:38,252
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Well, now you won't realize your chance to scrub in.

374
00:17:38,615 --> 00:17:41,718
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): You're banned from the OR, mine or anyone else's, all week.

375
00:17:41,738 --> 00:17:42,700
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I got the history on the tumor.

376
00:17:42,818 --> 00:17:44,480
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): It's been growing for a year and a half.

377
00:17:45,343 --> 00:17:47,605
Dr. Karev / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): A year and a half, and it's the first time she's even had it looked at.

378
00:17:47,663 --> 00:17:48,945
Dr. Karev / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): It's like she's fatally lazy.

379
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:54,847
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Why doesn't she get banned?

380
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:58,333
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Go prep Anna Connors for surgery.

381
00:17:58,451 --> 00:17:59,575
Dr. Bailey / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You're scrubbing in with Christina.

382
00:17:59,615 --> 00:17:59,855
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Really?

383
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:00,836
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I mean, thank you.

384
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:02,597
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Um, OK.

385
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,163
Nurse or Intern (possibly Alex Karev) / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): We just need to recheck your labs and get an EKG, so I just need to take a little blood.

386
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,847
Annie / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Dr. Burke is great, and Dr. Bailey.

387
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,651
Medical Professional (likely Alex Karev) / Annie Connors OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I know you're probably scared.

388
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:13,451
Annie's Mother / Annie Connors OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): That's OK, kitten.

389
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:15,054
Annie / Annie Connors (PVM): It can just do your job.

390
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:17,836
Annie Connors: You don't have to talk to the fat, nasty tumor lady.

391
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:21,162
Annie Connors: I mean, I let her get this bad, how much sympathy do I deserve?

392
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:25,009
Alex Karev / Mr. LaVangie OR Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Why did you let it get this bad?

393
00:18:28,134 --> 00:18:31,180
Annie Connors: I'm the first person since I got here to ask me that.

394
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,020
Alex Karev / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Well, I guess it's just like the elephant in the room.

395
00:18:33,663 --> 00:18:34,022
Annie Connors: Elephant?

396
00:18:34,644 --> 00:18:37,689
Annie Connors: I mean... It's more like a giant sow, don't you think?

397
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:47,182
Annie Connors: Every time I went to the hospital, someone died.

398
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,906
Annie Connors: All four of my grandparents, then my dad.

399
00:18:52,630 --> 00:19:00,759
Annie Connors: My best friend's mom, my baby sister, they all went in, never came out.

400
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:01,779
Annie Connors: So I put it off.

401
00:19:05,904 --> 00:19:08,430
Alex Karev / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You know, you're not the only one to put things off.

402
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,570
Alex Karev / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I mean, I never do anything to the last possible minute.

403
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:12,775
Annie Connors: Like what?

404
00:19:12,795 --> 00:19:19,363
Alex Karev / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): Well... I've had this thing from my roommate since, like, day one, and I just...

405
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:22,181
Alex Karev / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): I can't tell her.

406
00:19:22,721 --> 00:19:29,692
Alex Karev / Dr. George O'Malley (PVM): You know, she probably wouldn't go out with me anyway, but how do I know that for sure if I don't ever ask?

407
00:19:32,076 --> 00:19:32,536
Annie Connors: Seriously?

408
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,560
Annie Connors: You're equating your pathetic love life with my record-breaking tumor.

409
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:38,944
Cristina Yang / Annie Connors (PVM): Seriously.

410
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:47,778
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): It's just that he blatantly favors me in front of her and then blatantly dismisses me.

411
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,401
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): How do you know he was favoring you?

412
00:19:51,944 --> 00:19:52,865
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Look, you've got a brain.

413
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:54,028
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): You got into this program.

414
00:19:54,229 --> 00:19:57,992
Cristina Yang / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Just because Shepard likes to munch your cookies doesn't mean that you didn't deserve what you work for.

415
00:19:58,012 --> 00:19:59,213
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): But he's making me look bad.

416
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:01,758
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): I have to end it.

417
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:03,000
Cristina Yang / Dr. George O'Malley OR Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): Right.

418
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:04,382
Meredith Grey / Dr. Meredith Grey (PVM): It's over.

419

493
00:22:59,538 --> 00:23:09,692

494
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:12,916
Mr. LaVangie: Why in hell can't she drop it?
