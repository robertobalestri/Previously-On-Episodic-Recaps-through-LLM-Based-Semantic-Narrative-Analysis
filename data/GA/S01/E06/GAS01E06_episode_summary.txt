The story began with Meredith Grey grappling with the fallout from her romantic involvement with her boss, Dr. Derek Shepherd. Their relationship, forbidden by hospital rules, created tension among the interns and drew the disapproval of Dr. Miranda Bailey. Meredith's inner turmoil was compounded when a lawyer informed her that her mother's Alzheimer's was worsening, and she needed to sign over power of attorney while her mother was still lucid. Distracted by this news, Meredith arrived late to work, further straining her relationship with Bailey, who was already upset about Meredith's affair with an attending.

Meanwhile, George O'Malley endured teasing from Cristina Yang and Izzie Stevens about his feelings for Meredith. Although George denied any romantic interest, it was clear to his friends that he cared deeply for her. Cristina confronted Meredith about her recent avoidance, but Meredith was unwilling to discuss her problems. Cristina pointed out that Bailey was no longer speaking to Meredith, heightening Meredith's anxiety about the consequences if her relationship with Derek were discovered.

The interns were assigned to new patients. One major case involved Annie Connors, a 43-year-old woman whose massive tumor had left her housebound for a year. Dr. Burke, Bailey, and the interns discussed the complexity of Annie's surgery. Annie, preferring to be called by her first name, maintained a cheerful demeanor and flirted with Alex Karev, asking him to accompany her for a CT scan. During the scan, Alex and a technician made insensitive remarks about Annie's condition, unaware that Annie could hear them through the microphone. Hurt by their words, Annie later refused to have Alex in her operating room, and Bailey punished Alex by banning him from the OR for a week.

George presented a post-op heart patient, Mr. Harper, to Bailey and became involved in his care. Meredith was assigned to Mr. LaVangie, a 63-year-old man with Parkinson's disease who had been admitted for pain management. Mr. LaVangie's daughter asked Meredith to discuss the possibility of deep brain stimulation surgery, a risky procedure that could improve his quality of life. Meredith empathized with her, sharing her own experience of watching her mother's decline.

The surgical team debated the best approach for Annie's tumor, which had infiltrated her spine and displaced her lungs. Derek Shepherd voiced concerns about the risks, including paralysis and death, but ultimately agreed to attempt the surgery. Annie's mother insisted on proceeding, but Annie remained firm about excluding Alex from the operation.

Cristina and Izzie were excited to scrub in on Annie's surgery. Cristina joked about Dr. Burke's interest in her, and the interns exchanged banter about their relationships and the challenges of their program. Meredith confided in Annie about her tendency to put things off, and Annie admitted her fear of hospitals stemmed from losing loved ones there. Meredith also discussed her conflicted feelings about her relationship with Derek, worried about favoritism and her reputation.

The surgeries commenced. Cristina and Izzie assisted on Annie's tumor removal, which proved extremely difficult due to its size and vascularity. Meanwhile, Derek and Meredith persuaded Mr. LaVangie to undergo deep brain stimulation before his condition worsened. The procedure was performed while Mr. LaVangie was awake, and the team successfully improved his symptoms.

In Annie's operating room, the surgery became increasingly perilous as the tumor bled heavily and the team ran low on blood supplies. Despite their efforts, Annie died on the table, leaving the team exhausted and disappointed. Cristina, in particular, felt her hard work had been for nothing.

Elsewhere, George and Izzie faced a crisis when Mr. Harper crashed. Forced to perform an emergency bedside thoracotomy, Izzie was terrified, having never done the procedure before. Cristina talked her through it, and Izzie managed to remove a clot and massage the heart, saving Mr. Harper's life. The attending surgeon was initially angry that he hadn't been paged, but Izzie insisted she had tried multiple times.

After the surgeries, tensions flared among the interns. Cristina told Meredith she was done doing her favors, feeling unappreciated after holding up Annie's tumor for hours only for the patient to die. Izzie and Alex argued about their dynamic, with Izzie rejecting Alex's advances and hinting she might be seeing someone else. George and Alex discussed Meredith, and Cristina told Alex that Meredith was “off the market,” though George insisted they were just friends.

As the day ended, Meredith reflected on the events, realizing that taking action, even when it led to failure, was better than doing nothing at all. Derek invited Meredith to watch the sunrise over the ferry boats, recalling a detail from their earlier conversations. Meredith narrated about the importance of seizing the day and learning from mistakes, concluding that even the worst failures were better than never trying at all.
