The episode began with Meredith Grey and Dr. Derek Shepherd discussing the risks of continuing their secret romantic relationship, especially now that their supervisor, Dr. Miranda Bailey, had discovered the affair and was pointedly avoiding Meredith. Meredith felt conflicted about being the intern involved with an attending physician, and the tension between her personal and professional life weighed heavily on her.

That morning, Meredith joined her fellow interns—Cristina Yang, Izzie Stevens, George O'Malley, and Alex Karev—for their daily routine. Cristina and Izzie teased George about his supposed feelings for Meredith, but George insisted he was not interested in her romantically. The group reflected on the importance of not procrastinating, echoing Benjamin Franklin's advice, as Meredith internally narrated her own struggles with fear and indecision.

Arriving late to work, Meredith was confronted by Cristina, who pressed her about avoiding her friends since Bailey had caught Meredith and Derek together. Meredith admitted the situation was complicated, especially now that Bailey was not speaking to her. Meanwhile, Derek confided to Meredith that if he were a better man, he would end their relationship, but Meredith remained uncertain about what she wanted.

Bailey gathered the interns and introduced them to Annie Connors, a 43-year-old woman with a massive tumor pressing against her diaphragm. Annie maintained a cheerful demeanor and joked with the interns, particularly Alex, whom she requested to accompany her for her CT scan. The interns were astonished by the tumor's size and speculated about its weight. They learned that Annie had been housebound for over a year, paralyzed by fear of hospitals after losing many family members to illness.

The interns were then assigned to various patients. Meredith presented the case of Mr. LaVangie, a 63-year-old man with Parkinson's disease admitted for pain management. The team discussed the possibility of deep brain stimulation surgery, but Mr. LaVangie was adamant in his refusal to undergo brain surgery. His daughter pleaded with Meredith to persuade him, hoping her father could be well enough to attend her upcoming wedding. Meredith, relating to the daughter's pain because of her own mother's illness, promised to try.

Bailey warned Derek not to show Meredith any favoritism, threatening to keep Meredith out of the operating room if she saw any bias. During Annie's CT scan, a microphone was accidentally left on, and Annie overheard Alex and other interns making insensitive remarks about her condition. Hurt by their comments, Annie requested that Alex not be present during her surgery. Bailey reprimanded the interns for their lack of professionalism, especially Izzie, and banned Izzie from the operating room for the week.

Cristina and Izzie discussed Annie's long delay in seeking medical help, and Izzie later spoke with Annie, who revealed her deep-seated fear of hospitals after losing so many loved ones there. George, attempting to relate, confided in Annie about his own fear of asking out his roommate, but Annie dismissed the comparison as trivial.

Meredith continued to struggle with her relationship with Derek, feeling that his actions—whether favoring her or keeping his distance—were making her look bad in front of her colleagues. Cristina advised Meredith to end the relationship, and Meredith resolved to do so.

The interns were excited about the upcoming surgery to remove Annie's tumor, with Cristina especially eager to participate. Cristina joked that Dr. Burke, the attending surgeon, might be interested in her, but the group's camaraderie was strained by the day's stress and the ongoing tension between Meredith and Derek.

Derek made another attempt to convince Mr. LaVangie to consider deep brain stimulation, explaining the risks and benefits, but Mr. LaVangie remained firm in his refusal. Later, Meredith appealed to him, emphasizing how his choices affected his daughter's life and encouraging him to try the surgery for her sake.

The surgery to remove Annie's tumor began, with George and another intern assigned to retract the enormous mass for hours. The surgical team was amazed by the tumor's size and complexity, which was intertwined with major blood vessels. The operation was long and grueling, requiring large amounts of blood.

At the same time, Derek performed the deep brain stimulation procedure on Mr. LaVangie, with Meredith and Izzie assisting. The tense operation required Mr. LaVangie to remain awake while Derek located the correct spot in the brain, and the surgery was ultimately successful.

Elsewhere, Izzie and Cristina were forced to perform an emergency bedside surgery on a post-operative heart patient, Mr. Harper, when his condition suddenly deteriorated. With no attending available, Izzie, coached by Cristina and a resident over the phone, cracked the patient's chest and removed a clot, saving his life.

Back in Annie's surgery, complications arose as the tumor proved even more invasive than expected. The team struggled to control the bleeding, and despite their efforts, Annie died on the operating table. The surgical team was devastated by the loss after their long and exhausting effort.

After the surgeries, Meredith confronted Derek about their relationship, insisting that he could not do her favors or treat her poorly because of their personal involvement. Derek agreed, and Meredith asserted her independence.

Cristina, exhausted and frustrated after hours of holding up the tumor, argued with Burke about the ambiguity of their own relationship, questioning whether he wanted to complicate things further.

George, still in denial about his feelings for Meredith, was told by Alex that Meredith was “off the market,” alluding to her relationship with Derek. George insisted that he and Meredith were just friends.

As the episode drew to a close, Meredith reflected on the importance of facing fears and making decisions, even if they led to mistakes. Derek invited Meredith to watch the sunrise with him, and she realized that trying and failing was better than never trying at all. Derek thanked her, bringing the episode to an end.
