A narrator began by recalling Benjamin Franklin's advice not to put off tasks, reflecting on how fear—of failure, pain, or rejection—often leads people to procrastinate. In a hospital, a group of interns waited for someone who was late. One intern insisted they should not wait, while another joked about not being the person's boyfriend yet. The conversation turned to whether one intern wanted to ask another out, which was quickly denied. The narrator continued, describing the fear of making decisions and mistakes.

Meredith arrived late and was confronted by another person, who accused her of avoiding them. Meredith admitted she was both late and avoiding the person. They briefly discussed whether to talk about a situation involving Bailey and what she had witnessed. Meredith expressed her discomfort about being the intern sleeping with the attending and noted that Bailey was not speaking to her. The attending said that if he were a better man, he would walk away, and asked Meredith if she wanted that. Meredith was unsure and left, saying she was late, while the attending told her to take her time and think about it.

Meredith found Cristina and discussed being late and whether Bailey had told anyone about Meredith's relationship with “McDreamy.” Cristina reassured Meredith that Bailey had not told anyone but warned that if the relationship was discovered, the attending could face professional consequences. Meredith decided she had to end the relationship. Cristina told Meredith to stop whining, insisting that no good could come from sleeping with a boss. Bailey entered and noted that both Cristina and Meredith were late.

Bailey instructed the interns to maintain decorum before entering a patient's room, warning them not to laugh or react. The group entered and greeted Miss Connors, who preferred to be called Annie and had a large visible tumor. Dr. Burke was introduced as the attending surgeon. Alex Karev presented Annie's case: a 43-year-old woman with a large tumor pressing on her diaphragm, scheduled for a CT scan. Annie joked about Alex taking her for the scan because he was fun to look at. Bailey assigned tasks, and the interns discussed the size of Annie's tumor after leaving the room.

Bailey told the interns that Annie Connors's surgery would occupy most of the surgeons, so the interns would need to work extra hard and avoid mistakes. Cristina expressed interest in being involved in the surgery. Bailey instructed Meredith to find Annie's mother and get a family history. A trauma call was heard over the intercom, and Cristina and Bailey had a brief exchange about not talking.

Meredith presented Mr. Harper's case to an attending: he had a coronary bypass, his blood pressure was low overnight but responded to medication, and his chest tube output had stopped. Meredith suggested a chest X-ray and checking the tube for occlusion. The attending approved the plan and said the patient was doing fine.

George told another intern that he did not have romantic feelings for Meredith, despite what others might think. He asked that nothing be said to Meredith to avoid awkwardness since they lived together. The other intern told George to stop talking.

A group of interns and Bailey visited Mr. LaVangie, a 63-year-old man admitted for pain management for dyskinesia. An intern presented his case, mentioning possible treatments for Parkinson's disease and spinal pain. The attending assigned Meredith to prep Mr. LaVangie for a procedure and assist.

Bailey approached an attending, warning him not to show favoritism toward Meredith Grey. Bailey threatened that if she saw any favoritism, Meredith would be kept out of the operating room for a month. Bailey said she would not advertise the attending's relationship with Meredith but insisted on fairness.

Annie was prepared for her CT scan. An intern reassured her that there was a microphone in the scanner in case she got scared. Annie said she would be fine, and the intern promised to be nearby as Annie was moved into the scanner.

Two interns discussed Annie's tumor while watching the scan. They were surprised by its size and questioned how someone could let it get that bad. One suggested Annie might be afraid of doctors, while another was unsympathetic, calling her “warped.”

Annie's mother explained that they initially thought Annie was gaining weight, but when they realized it was a tumor, Annie was too scared to see a doctor. The larger the tumor grew, the less Annie wanted to seek help. Annie only felt sick the previous night when she couldn't breathe, prompting her mother to call 911.

Meredith checked on Mr. LaVangie and was approached by his daughter, who asked Meredith to talk to her father about brain surgery. The daughter was getting married soon and wanted her father to be present. Meredith related to having a sick parent and agreed to try to help.

A group of surgeons discussed Annie's CT results. The tumor was displacing her lung and infiltrating her spinal canal. The surgeons debated the best approach for surgery, weighing the risks of paralysis and death. One surgeon questioned whether Annie wanted to live, given how long she waited to seek help. Another argued that people do risky things every day and that Annie was only 43, so surgery was worth a try.

Meredith asked Dr. Shepherd about Mr. LaVangie and whether he was a candidate for deep brain stimulation. Dr. Shepherd said the patient was a candidate but was not interested in the procedure. Meredith suggested pushing the patient, but Dr. Shepherd refused and removed Meredith from the case for questioning his decision.

Bailey spoke to Annie about her upcoming surgery, explaining the risks. Annie's mother insisted Annie would have the surgery, but Annie said she would only do it if Alex Karev was not present. Bailey agreed to Annie's condition and banned Alex from the operating room for the week after learning he had offended Annie by speaking negatively about her while the microphone was on during the scan.

An intern prepared Annie for surgery, taking blood and reassuring her. Annie called herself the “fat, nasty tumor lady” and said she didn't deserve sympathy. The intern asked why Annie let it get so bad. Annie explained that she avoided hospitals because everyone she knew who went in died. The intern related by admitting to putting off telling a roommate about romantic feelings, comparing it to Annie's avoidance. Annie joked about the comparison.

Cristina complained to Bailey about being treated unfairly because of Meredith's relationship with Dr. Shepherd. Bailey told Cristina that Meredith earned her opportunities and that Cristina should not blame Meredith. Meredith decided she had to end the relationship. Another intern asked Cristina about scrubbing in on Annie's surgery, and the group joked about Burke's intentions. Alex tried to join the conversation but was rebuffed.

Cristina told the group that Dr. Shepherd was a jackass for reprimanding her. Another intern disagreed, saying Dr. Shepherd was great. The group discussed having a bad day and considered going out for drinks together. Someone gave another intern a drink, and there was a brief, awkward exchange.

An intern checked on Mr. LaVangie, who was still refusing brain surgery. His daughter pleaded with him to reconsider, but he insisted it was his life and his decision. Meredith told him that it was also his daughter's life and asked him to try for her sake.

In the operating room, the surgeons prepared for Annie's surgery, warning the interns that retracting the tumor would be physically demanding. Meanwhile, Meredith informed Dr. Shepherd that Mr. LaVangie had agreed to deep brain stimulation if it was done that day. Dr. Shepherd prepared for the procedure.

Bailey confronted Meredith about her relationship with Dr. Shepherd, saying she didn't care about the details but was concerned about how it affected the work environment and the other interns. Bailey warned Meredith about the consequences for everyone involved.

Two interns were assigned to less desirable tasks while others were in surgery. One complained about being left out, and the other joked about doing the work in the stairwell. They parted ways.

In the operating room, the surgeons and interns began Annie's surgery. They discussed the need for more blood due to the tumor's size and the risk of bleeding. George was chastised for losing focus while retracting the tumor.

Dr. Shepherd performed the deep brain stimulation procedure on Mr. LaVangie, who was awake. Meredith was present to reassure the patient. The procedure involved drilling into the skull and finding the correct spot in the brain. The patient joked with Meredith, and the procedure was successful.

Izzie was called away from her tasks to check on another patient. She asked a nurse to page Alex again, as he was not responding. The nurse said she already had, but Izzie insisted.

In the operating room, the surgeons continued working on Annie's tumor. They were surprised by the size of an artery feeding the tumor and requested more O negative blood. George was asked to assist by applying pressure.

Dr. Shepherd and Meredith discussed the professional boundaries of their relationship. Meredith insisted she could take care of herself and did not want special treatment. Dr. Shepherd acknowledged this, and Meredith was praised for her work.

Cristina apologized to Dr. Shepherd for calling him a jackass. He joked that if Meredith did not marry him, he would. The mood was light.

A crisis occurred with Mr. Harper, whose blood pressure dropped and who went into a dangerous heart rhythm. Izzie was present and was told to open his chest at the bedside, despite never having done it before. She was coached through the procedure by another person. Izzie removed a clot by hand and massaged the heart until a pulse returned.

The surgeons continued Annie's surgery, struggling with blood loss and the complexity of the tumor. They requested more blood and worked to control the bleeding. George assisted by applying pressure. Despite their efforts, Annie's condition worsened.

Annie Connors died in the operating room, and the time of death was called.

The narrator reflected on proverbs about time and seizing the day. Izzie apologized for the loss of Annie, but was told not to be sorry because she had saved a life. The narrator continued about learning from experience.

Cristina told Burke she would not do him any more favors, complaining about the physical toll of the surgery and the patient's death. Burke asked what their relationship was, and Cristina questioned if he really wanted a definition. They shared a moment, and Cristina told him to lock the door.

Alex asked if anyone had seen Meredith. Another intern told him Meredith was “off the market.” George insisted he and Meredith were just friends and would know if she were seeing someone.

The narrator reflected on the importance of acting rather than wondering. Meredith and Dr. Shepherd met and discussed a place with a view of the sunrise over the ferry boats. Meredith said she had a thing for ferry boats, and Dr. Shepherd remembered. The narrator concluded that even the biggest failure is better than never trying. Someone said, “Thank you.”
