The episode opens with a recap of previous events, focusing on Meredith Grey’s complicated relationship with her boss, Dr. Derek Shepherd, and the tension it creates among the interns and with Dr. Miranda Bailey. Meredith and Derek have slept together, and Meredith is conflicted about continuing the relationship because it’s against hospital rules. George O'Malley is teased by Cristina Yang and Izzie Stevens about his feelings for Meredith, but he insists he’s not interested in her that way, though it’s clear he is.

Meredith receives news from a lawyer that her mother’s Alzheimer’s is advancing and she needs to sign over power of attorney while her mother is still lucid. Meredith is distracted and late to work, causing further strain with Bailey, who is already upset with her for sleeping with an attending. Cristina confronts Meredith about avoiding her, but Meredith doesn’t want to talk about it. Cristina points out that Bailey isn’t speaking to Meredith anymore, and Meredith worries about the consequences if their relationship is discovered.

The interns are assigned to various patients. One major case is Annie Connors, a 43-year-old woman with a massive tumor pressing against her diaphragm, making her housebound for a year. Dr. Burke, Dr. Bailey, and the interns discuss the complexity of her surgery. Annie is jovial, preferring to be called by her first name, and flirts with Alex Karev, asking him to take her for her CT scan. During the scan, Alex and a technician make insensitive comments about Annie’s condition, not realizing the microphone is on and Annie can hear everything.

Meanwhile, George presents a post-op heart patient, Mr. Harper, to Dr. Bailey, and is later involved in his care. Meredith is assigned to Mr. LaVangie, a 63-year-old man with Parkinson’s disease, admitted for pain management. Mr. LaVangie’s daughter asks Meredith to talk to him about deep brain stimulation (DBS), a risky but potentially life-improving surgery. Meredith relates to her, sharing her own experience of watching a parent decline.

The surgical team debates the best approach for Annie’s tumor, which is infiltrating her spine and displacing her lungs. Derek Shepherd expresses concern about the risks, including paralysis and death, but ultimately agrees the surgery is worth attempting. Annie’s mother insists on the surgery, but Annie refuses to have Alex Karev in the OR after overhearing his cruel remarks. Bailey bans Karev from the OR for a week.

Cristina and Izzie are excited to scrub in on Annie’s surgery. Cristina jokes about Dr. Burke’s interest in her, and the interns banter about their relationships and the challenges of the program. Meredith confides in Annie about putting things off, and Annie admits her fear of hospitals stems from losing loved ones there. Meredith also discusses her relationship with Derek, feeling conflicted about the favoritism and the impact on her reputation.

The surgeries begin. Cristina and Izzie assist on Annie’s tumor, which proves to be extremely challenging due to its size and vascularity. Meanwhile, Derek and Meredith persuade Mr. LaVangie to undergo DBS before his condition worsens. The surgery is performed while Mr. LaVangie is awake, and the team successfully locates the correct spot in his brain, improving his symptoms.

Back in the OR, Annie’s surgery becomes increasingly difficult as the tumor bleeds heavily. The team struggles to control the bleeding and runs low on blood supplies. Despite their efforts, Annie dies on the table. The team is exhausted and disappointed, especially Cristina, who feels her hard work was for nothing.

Elsewhere, George and Izzie are forced to perform an emergency bedside thoracotomy on Mr. Harper when he crashes. Izzie is terrified, having never done the procedure before, but Cristina talks her through it. Izzie manages to remove a clot and massage the heart, saving Mr. Harper’s life. The attending surgeon is initially angry that he wasn’t paged, but Izzie insists she tried multiple times.

After the surgeries, tensions flare among the interns. Cristina tells Meredith she’s done doing her favors, feeling unappreciated after holding up Annie’s tumor for hours only for the patient to die. Izzie and Alex argue about their dynamic, with Izzie rejecting Alex’s advances and hinting she might be seeing someone else.

George and Alex discuss Meredith, with Cristina telling Alex that Meredith is “off the market,” though George insists they’re just friends. Meredith reflects on the day’s events, realizing that action, even when it leads to failure, is better than inaction.

The episode ends with Derek inviting Meredith to watch the sunrise over the ferry boats, recalling a detail from their earlier conversations. Meredith narrates about the importance of seizing the day and learning from mistakes, concluding that even the worst failures are better than never trying at all.
