The episode opens with a recap of previous events, focusing on Meredith Grey’s complicated relationship with her boss, Dr. Derek Shepherd, and the secrecy surrounding their affair. Meredith and Derek discuss their relationship, acknowledging the professional risks involved. Meredith is conflicted about continuing the relationship, especially as Dr. Miranda Bailey, their supervisor, has become aware of it and is now avoiding Meredith.

The interns—Meredith, Cristina Yang, Izzie Stevens, George O’Malley, and Alex Karev—gather for their morning routine. Cristina and Izzie tease George about his feelings for Meredith, but George insists he is not interested in her romantically. The group discusses the importance of not putting things off, referencing Benjamin Franklin’s advice, as Meredith narrates about fear and procrastination.

Meredith arrives late to work, and Cristina confronts her about avoiding her after Bailey witnessed Meredith and Derek together. Meredith admits the situation is complicated, especially since she is now the intern sleeping with the attending, and Bailey is not speaking to her. Derek tells Meredith that if he were a better man, he would walk away from their relationship, but Meredith is indecisive.

Bailey gathers the interns and introduces them to Annie Connors, a 43-year-old woman with a massive tumor pressing against her diaphragm. Annie is upbeat and jokes with the interns, particularly Alex, whom she requests to accompany her for her CT scan. The interns are amazed by the size of Annie’s tumor and speculate about its weight. They learn that Annie has been housebound for a year and a half, afraid to seek medical help due to past family experiences with hospitals.

Meanwhile, the interns are assigned various patients. Meredith presents the case of Mr. LaVangie, a 63-year-old man with Parkinson’s disease, admitted for pain management. The team discusses possible treatments, including deep brain stimulation (DBS), but Mr. LaVangie is resistant to the idea of brain surgery. His daughter pleads with Meredith to convince him, as she wants her father to be present and well at her upcoming wedding. Meredith relates to her, given her own mother’s illness, and promises to try.

Bailey warns Derek not to show favoritism toward Meredith, threatening to keep Meredith out of the OR if she sees any bias. During Annie’s CT scan, a microphone is accidentally left on, and Annie overhears Alex and others making insensitive comments about her condition. Annie is hurt and requests that Alex not be present during her surgery. Bailey reprimands the interns, especially Izzie, for the incident and bans her from the OR for the week.

Cristina and Izzie discuss Annie’s history, noting how long she waited before seeking help. Izzie later talks to Annie, who reveals her fear of hospitals due to losing many loved ones there. George, relating to Annie’s avoidance, confides about his own fear of asking out his roommate, but Annie is unimpressed by the comparison.

Meredith continues to struggle with her relationship with Derek, feeling that his actions—both favoring and dismissing her—are making her look bad. Cristina advises her to end the relationship, and Meredith resolves to do so.

The interns are excited about the upcoming surgery on Annie’s tumor, with Cristina especially eager to participate. Cristina jokes that Dr. Burke, the attending surgeon, might be interested in her. The group’s camaraderie is interrupted by the stress of the day and the ongoing tension between Meredith and Derek.

Derek tries again to convince Mr. LaVangie to consider DBS, explaining the risks and benefits, but Mr. LaVangie remains adamant in his refusal. Meredith later appeals to him, emphasizing that his daughter’s life is also affected by his choices, and encourages him to try the surgery for her sake.

The surgery on Annie’s tumor begins, with George and another intern tasked with retracting the massive tumor for hours. The surgical team is amazed by the size and complexity of the tumor, which is intertwined with major blood vessels. The operation is long and grueling, requiring large amounts of blood.

Simultaneously, Derek performs DBS on Mr. LaVangie, with Meredith and Izzie assisting. The procedure is tense, as Mr. LaVangie must remain awake. Derek successfully locates the correct spot in the brain, and the surgery goes well.

Elsewhere, Izzie and Cristina are forced to perform an emergency bedside surgery on a post-op heart patient, Mr. Harper, when his condition rapidly deteriorates. With no attending available, Izzie, coached by Cristina and a resident over the phone, cracks the patient’s chest and removes a clot, saving his life.

Back in Annie’s surgery, complications arise as the tumor is even more invasive than expected. The team struggles to control bleeding, and despite their efforts, Annie dies on the operating table. The team is devastated by the loss after their long effort.

After the surgeries, Meredith confronts Derek about their relationship, insisting that he cannot do her favors or treat her poorly based on their personal involvement. Derek agrees, and Meredith asserts her independence.

Cristina, exhausted and frustrated after holding up the tumor for hours, argues with Burke about their undefined relationship. She questions whether he wants to be “that guy” who complicates things further.

George, still in denial about his feelings for Meredith, is told by Alex that Meredith is “off the market,” implying her relationship with Derek. George insists they are just friends.

The episode closes with Meredith’s narration about the importance of facing fears and making decisions, even if they lead to mistakes. Derek invites Meredith to watch the sunrise with him, and she reflects that trying and failing is better than never trying at all. Derek thanks her, bringing the episode to a close.
