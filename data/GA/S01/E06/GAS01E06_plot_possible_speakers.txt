The episode opens with a recap of previous events: Meredith Grey and Derek Shepherd’s complicated relationship, including their one-night stand and Meredith’s concerns about dating her boss, which is against hospital rules. George O’Malley’s feelings for Meredith are also highlighted, as is the progression of Meredith’s mother’s Alzheimer’s disease, with Dr. Webber advising Meredith to get her mother’s affairs in order.

Meredith narrates about procrastination and fear, setting the episode’s theme. The interns—Meredith, Cristina Yang, Izzie Stevens, George O’Malley, and Alex Karev—gather for their day. Cristina teases George about his crush on Meredith, which he denies, insisting he doesn’t want to ask her out. The group discusses the risks of sleeping with one’s boss, referencing Meredith’s situation with Derek.

Dr. Miranda Bailey, the residents’ supervisor, instructs the interns to maintain professionalism as they prepare to meet Annie Connors, a patient with a massive abdominal tumor. Annie’s case is presented by Alex Karev, who describes her symptoms and the tumor’s impact. Annie jokes about her age and weight, preferring to be called by her first name. Dr. Burke, the attending surgeon, plans the next steps and assigns Izzie to take Annie for a CT scan, but Annie requests Alex instead, finding him attractive.

The interns speculate about the tumor’s weight and marvel at the case’s uniqueness. They also observe Alex’s uncharacteristically sincere behavior with Annie. Dr. Webber warns the interns that Annie’s surgery will occupy most of the surgical staff, so they must be extra vigilant with other patients.

Cristina and Izzie both want to participate in Annie’s surgery, but Cristina is more aggressive about it. Bailey assigns them to gather Annie’s family history. Meanwhile, George presents another patient, Mr. Harper, who is recovering from a coronary bypass. Bailey quizzes George on his plan for the patient, which he answers correctly.

George awkwardly clarifies to his fellow interns that he doesn’t have romantic feelings for Meredith, asking them not to tease him about it in front of her. The group then meets Mr. LaVangie, a Parkinson’s patient admitted for pain management. Meredith suggests an intraspinal catheter for pain control, which Bailey approves, assigning her to prep and assist with the procedure.

Bailey confronts Derek privately, warning him not to show favoritism toward Meredith or she’ll ensure Meredith is kept out of the OR. Derek insists Meredith is simply talented, but Bailey is firm about maintaining fairness.

Annie undergoes her CT scan, with Alex and the other interns observing. Annie’s family discusses her fear of doctors and how the tumor grew unchecked for over a year. Meredith is approached by Mr. LaVangie’s daughter, who asks if her father is a candidate for deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. Meredith promises to look into it, relating to the daughter’s struggle with a sick parent.

The surgical team debates the best approach for Annie’s complex tumor, weighing the risks of paralysis versus death if the surgery is not performed. Meredith asks Derek about Mr. LaVangie’s suitability for DBS, but Derek refuses to push the patient into a risky brain surgery he doesn’t want. Meredith is removed from the case for questioning Derek’s decision.

Meredith informs Annie and her family about the risks of surgery. Annie agrees to the operation on the condition that a particular surgeon (implied to be Alex, after overhearing disparaging remarks via a live microphone) is not present. Bailey bans Meredith from the OR for the week due to the incident.

Cristina and Alex discuss Annie’s avoidance of medical care, and Alex asks Annie directly why she let the tumor grow so large. Annie explains her fear of hospitals, stemming from losing loved ones who never returned after being admitted. Alex relates, admitting he procrastinates in his own life, particularly about confessing feelings to a roommate.

Meredith continues to struggle with her relationship with Derek, feeling that his favoritism is making her look bad. She resolves to end things with him. Meanwhile, Cristina is excited to scrub in on Annie’s surgery, and the interns joke about the possibility of Dr. Burke being interested in Cristina.

Later, the interns gather in the lounge, commiserating over their difficult day. George suggests they all go out for drinks. Meredith and Cristina discuss the fallout from Meredith’s relationship with Derek, and Bailey warns Meredith that her actions are affecting the entire group.

The surgeries begin. Meredith, Cristina, and George assist in Annie’s operation, which is physically grueling due to the tumor’s size. Meanwhile, Derek and Bailey perform DBS on Mr. LaVangie, with Izzie encouraging the patient through the procedure.

Suddenly, Mr. Harper, the post-op heart patient, crashes. Cristina and Izzie must perform an emergency bedside thoracotomy to relieve cardiac tamponade, despite their inexperience. Cristina talks Izzie through the procedure, and together they manage to save the patient’s life.

Back in Annie’s surgery, the team struggles with massive blood loss and the complexity of the tumor. Despite their efforts, Annie’s condition deteriorates, and she dies on the table.

Afterward, the interns are exhausted and emotionally drained. Meredith reflects in voiceover on the importance of action over hesitation, echoing Benjamin Franklin’s advice. The group discusses the day’s events, with George and Alex debating Meredith’s relationship status. Meredith and Derek share a quiet moment, with Derek inviting her to watch the sunrise over the ferry boats, recalling a detail from their earlier conversations. Meredith admits she has a thing for ferry boats, and Derek remembers.

The episode ends with Meredith’s narration about the value of knowing over wondering, and the importance of trying, even if it leads to failure.
