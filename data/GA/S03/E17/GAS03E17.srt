1
00:00:00,045 --> 00:00:01,379
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,383 --> 00:00:03,826
I raised you to be an
extraordinary human being.

3
00:00:03,895 --> 00:00:06,286
Imagine my disappointment
when I wake up after 5 years

4
00:00:06,307 --> 00:00:08,821
and discover that you're
no more than ordinary.

5
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:12,731
An hour ago, he was proposing.
Now he's going to the morgue.

6
00:00:12,868 --> 00:00:13,794
You did good.

7
00:00:17,423 --> 00:00:19,236
Do you believe in heaven ?

8
00:00:22,295 --> 00:00:25,026
<i>There are medical miracles.<i>

9
00:00:26,045 --> 00:00:28,654
<i>Being worshippers
at the altar of science,<i>

10
00:00:29,255 --> 00:00:31,810
<i>we don't like to believe miracles exist.<i>

11
00:00:32,662 --> 00:00:33,418
<i>But they do.<i>

12
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:36,314
<i>Things happen.<i>

13
00:00:38,786 --> 00:00:41,933
<i>We can't explain them,
we can't control them...<i>

14
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:44,431
<i>but they do happen.<i>

15
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:48,793
Chief, I know the hypothermia is
protective to her vital organs but,

16
00:00:48,975 --> 00:00:50,750
How much longer do you think
we can go on like this ?

17
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:52,273
I've seen people last
as long as 4 hours.

18
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:52,943
Yeah, but you...

19
00:00:53,048 --> 00:00:55,933
No, this is not...
This is Ellis Grey's little girl.

20
00:00:56,246 --> 00:00:56,681
This is my...

21
00:00:56,707 --> 00:00:58,520
We're all on the same
side here, Chief.

22
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:00,671
Sir...

23
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:09,810
Her body temp is at 86 degrees. She's
not dead until she is warm and dead.

24
00:01:09,877 --> 00:01:12,623
We need to warm her up to 98.6
and start her heart.

25
00:01:12,646 --> 00:01:13,613
Yes, sir.

26
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:17,170
Let's do a gastric lavage
with warm fluids.

27
00:01:24,988 --> 00:01:25,411
Addison.

28
00:01:25,425 --> 00:01:28,890
- I have to go. I... it's my Jane Doe.
- Just... they're waiting...

29
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,332
for you. So...

30
00:01:31,685 --> 00:01:33,943
Whatever you choose to say will...

31
00:01:39,187 --> 00:01:41,302
<i>Miracles do happen in medecine.<i>

32
00:01:43,965 --> 00:01:45,132
<i>They happen every day.<i>

33
00:01:46,868 --> 00:01:49,382
<i>Just not always when we
need them to happen.<i>

34
00:02:04,785 --> 00:02:05,332
Meredith ?

35
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:07,921
She's freaking out.

36
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:08,950
She's not freaking out.

37
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:09,840
People tend to freak out.

38
00:02:09,867 --> 00:02:10,781
Trust me, she's fine.

39
00:02:11,277 --> 00:02:13,413
Oh, okay, mr. I been dead longer,
knows everything.

40
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:15,171
You know what ? That's why
I don't like to be here with you,

41
00:02:15,197 --> 00:02:18,050
because you don't assess the situation.
You just dive right in.

42
00:02:18,118 --> 00:02:20,242
Oh, I'm not the one who got
himself all blown up.

43
00:02:20,245 --> 00:02:22,191
All right, you wanna do this now
or you wanna do this later ?

44
00:02:22,217 --> 00:02:24,243
- Oh, I... I wanna do this now.
- You wanna do this now ?

45
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:25,573
I will kick your ass anytime.

46
00:02:25,597 --> 00:02:26,470
I'm the one with a fresh heart.

47
00:02:26,487 --> 00:02:28,252
- Oh, yeah, you're gonna kick my...
- This is the brain thing.

48
00:02:28,265 --> 00:02:30,452
This is the ketamine
neurotransmitter thing, right ?

49
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:32,002
- No.
- No.

50
00:02:32,815 --> 00:02:34,523
'Cause you'd think if this were my brain

51
00:02:34,886 --> 00:02:37,763
Doing this, the first person I'd want
to see, no offense,

52
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:39,930
Would be... Doc !

53
00:02:40,456 --> 00:02:42,502
What a good boy.

54
00:02:43,428 --> 00:02:44,381
Hi.

55
00:02:45,737 --> 00:02:48,412
- Hi, Buddy.
- Meredith.

56
00:02:49,888 --> 00:02:51,851
This is not your brain on drugs.

57
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,740
This is death. You are dead.

58
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:55,711
You're really freakin'dead.
You're dirt-nap dead.

59
00:02:55,728 --> 00:02:57,541
- No more you dead.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

60
00:02:58,658 --> 00:02:59,981
Way too harsh. Remember, we...

61
00:03:00,287 --> 00:03:02,030
we're gonna take it easy.
That was not easy.

62
00:03:07,725 --> 00:03:08,260
Meredith...

63
00:03:09,906 --> 00:03:12,042
You drowned... in Elliott bay.

64
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:13,292
You remember that ?

65
00:03:13,546 --> 00:03:15,912
Yeah, that sucked. Who's a good boy ?

66
00:03:16,185 --> 00:03:19,251
- Who's the best dog ?
- Oh, this is gonna take a while.

67
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,991
- Who's such a good boy ?
- We don't have a while.

68
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:23,713
She's running out of time.

69
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,830
Who's the best dog ?

70
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:28,893
Tell me.

71
00:03:29,185 --> 00:03:32,321
Her temp's still only 86.
There's still no heartbeat.

72
00:03:32,396 --> 00:03:33,881
We're hoping once she warms up...

73
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:34,883
- I want to go in there.
- No.

74
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:35,792
There's a risk of brain damage.

75
00:03:35,807 --> 00:03:37,022
- I need to go in there. I'm going in.
- Derek, you can't,

76
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:39,332
not for Meredith, not for anybody.
You're in no shape

77
00:03:45,278 --> 00:03:47,011
- It's not good.
- Is she still cyanotic ?

78
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:47,931
What was her initial temp ? 

79
00:03:47,946 --> 00:03:49,480
- I mean, what is taking so long ?
- Dr. Yang...

80
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:51,573
It's not good.

81
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:53,861
They're doing everything they can.

82
00:03:54,197 --> 00:03:54,923
I ...

83
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:56,953
You should maybe, um,

84
00:03:57,876 --> 00:03:59,262
Prepare yourselves.

85
00:04:01,138 --> 00:04:03,220
I have to go. Uh, my Jane Doe's awake.

86
00:04:03,488 --> 00:04:06,012
I'm coming with you.
Iz, you'll let us know ?

87
00:04:06,088 --> 00:04:07,523
Prepare ourselves ? That's...

88
00:04:08,226 --> 00:04:10,732
That's what we tell the families
before we call time of death.

89
00:04:10,926 --> 00:04:11,891
She's gonna be okay.

90
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:13,193
Sometimes you're wrong.

91
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:18,773
Unh-unh.

92
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:20,262
No.

93
00:04:20,757 --> 00:04:22,182
- Cristina...
- I am not doing this.

94
00:04:23,237 --> 00:04:23,983
Cristina.

95
00:04:30,778 --> 00:04:32,283
She's gonna survive this.

96
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:34,463
She's gonna survive this.

97
00:04:34,758 --> 00:04:37,692
She's gonna survive this. She's gonna
survive this. She's gonna survive...

98
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:39,001
Meredith.

99
00:04:40,457 --> 00:04:41,281
Meredith.

100
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:45,681
I don't know if you remember me.
I was your mother's scrub nurse.

101
00:04:46,065 --> 00:04:47,532
- I died from...
- Liver cancer.

102
00:04:51,435 --> 00:04:51,923
Bonnie ?

103
00:04:52,248 --> 00:04:53,622
She remembers me.

104
00:04:54,097 --> 00:04:54,971
You remember.

105
00:04:55,056 --> 00:04:57,352
You were a very important
patient for her.

106
00:04:57,387 --> 00:04:58,772
What are all of you doing here ?

107
00:04:58,956 --> 00:05:00,310
- Is this...
- It's not heaven.

108
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:01,503
We're here because
you called us here.

109
00:05:01,607 --> 00:05:02,863
I didn't. Did I ?

110
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:05,320
Tell us about the water, Meredith.

111
00:05:10,328 --> 00:05:12,341
You do not have the authority
to speak to me in that way.

112
00:05:12,368 --> 00:05:13,022
You are a bug.

113
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,851
- You understand ?
- I need you to hold still !

114
00:05:15,408 --> 00:05:15,892
Go ahead.

115
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:18,972
- Burke usually writes for lorazepam
when she's like this,
- This amateurs !

116
00:05:19,006 --> 00:05:20,733
- But I don't want to bother him.
- Let me out of this bed.

117
00:05:20,757 --> 00:05:22,231
Do it. Give it to her.

118
00:05:22,257 --> 00:05:23,120
Who do you think you are ? 

119
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:24,401
This is a day she should
sleep through.

120
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,300
Do you even know what you're doing ?

121
00:05:26,107 --> 00:05:26,982
Get me Richard !

122
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:30,410
I'm Dr. Montgomery. You need this
oxygen. I need you to lie back.

123
00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:31,513
No. I'm not...

124
00:05:31,557 --> 00:05:33,951
- I'm not supposed to be here.
- This wasn't in your plan today.

125
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:36,380
I get that. But we're trying
to take care of your baby.

126
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:39,611
Now I need you to calm down.

127
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:44,721
Just... just tell her you're gonna take
me home. Just just talk to my husband.

128
00:05:46,808 --> 00:05:49,971
Th...  This is Dr. Karev. He's my intern.

129
00:05:50,138 --> 00:05:52,450
- What ? You're not ?
- You lost your I.D.

130
00:05:52,568 --> 00:05:53,920
We don't know where
your family is yet.

131
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:55,193
But I... I know you.

132
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:57,313
- You're my...
- No, I found you on the dock

133
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,341
after the accident.

134
00:05:58,787 --> 00:06:01,291
What dock ? What accident ?
What happened ?

135
00:06:01,318 --> 00:06:02,302
You were on the ferry.

136
00:06:03,765 --> 00:06:04,913
You don't remember ?

137
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:07,492
No.

138
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:08,882
What about your name ?

139
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:11,970
My name ?

140
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:14,040
- Shh.
- I don't know.

141
00:06:14,168 --> 00:06:15,542
- I'm having a baby.
- Shh.

142
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:17,162
I should know my own name.

143
00:06:17,258 --> 00:06:20,190
I'm having a baby. I should know
my own name.

144
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:24,188
She can't remember anything
from before the accident.

145
00:06:24,191 --> 00:06:25,254
It could be head trauma.

146
00:06:25,286 --> 00:06:26,973
It could be psychological
from the shock.

147
00:06:27,109 --> 00:06:29,942
I mean, retrograde amnesia...
it could be just transient, right ?

148
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,190
Well, that's the hope, but, you know,
I'm worried about her lungs, too.

149
00:06:32,206 --> 00:06:34,882
- Get a chest x-ray and an A.B.G.
- Okay.

150
00:06:36,337 --> 00:06:38,731
Hey, are you okay ? You want
to be with your friends ?

151
00:06:38,768 --> 00:06:41,031
- No, I'm... I'm on this.
- You sure ?

152
00:06:41,097 --> 00:06:44,202
Yeah, It's just, I don't know,
Meredith always makes me think...

153
00:06:44,815 --> 00:06:46,873
I don't know, screwed up people
have a chance.

154
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:49,270
I'm in.

155
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:51,751
Start the warm fluids. Hold C.P.R.

156
00:06:56,497 --> 00:06:57,041
Anything ?

157
00:06:58,386 --> 00:06:59,223
Her heart is still.

158
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:01,571
No movement,

159
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,290
No fibrillation.

160
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:04,150
Nothing ?

161
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:05,923
Nothing.

162
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:09,143
Restarting C.P.R.

163
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:13,193
- Stevens, get out of here.
- I just...

164
00:07:14,745 --> 00:07:15,473
Oh, my god.

165
00:07:15,566 --> 00:07:17,932
Go back outside and wait
with Yang and O'malley.

166
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,000
Cr... Cristina isn't, um,

167
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:20,742
She left.

168
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,861
She left in the middle of her shift ?
Where did she go ?

169
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:44,843
Meredith, I need you to understand.

170
00:07:44,905 --> 00:07:45,543
This is important. 

171
00:07:45,558 --> 00:07:46,640
- You can't screw around.
- Doc ?

172
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,871
There's no time for that. You don't have
the time, and we don't have the time.

173
00:07:49,896 --> 00:07:51,092
I drowned. That's all.

174
00:07:51,165 --> 00:07:54,033
- I drowned.
- Meredith, please listen to us.

175
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:56,232
You have to listen to us. You have to !

176
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:58,863
Oh, no.

177
00:08:15,757 --> 00:08:17,813
I can't find the source
of this bleeding !

178
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:20,131
I need gloves and surgical towels.

179
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:22,771
It happens with Bonnie, baby.
You just gotta ride it.

180
00:08:22,826 --> 00:08:23,861
I can save her.

181
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:26,061
- I can start an I.V.
- There's no point.

182
00:08:26,087 --> 00:08:29,171
Go to the O.R. and get me
sterilized surgical instruments.

183
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:29,892
Go.

184
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:31,111
Go !

185
00:08:42,186 --> 00:08:42,970
Meredith...

186
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:46,131
Are  you ready to talk about this now,

187
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,472
or you wanna waste some more time ?

188
00:08:51,738 --> 00:08:53,762
It's been over an hour.

189
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:55,080
There's a ch...

190
00:08:55,938 --> 00:08:57,932
We need to prepare for
the possibility that she may...

191
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:59,453
Look, she is young, she is healthy,

192
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:03,753
Her temp's going up, and it's gonna keep
going up and her heart will start again.

193
00:09:03,855 --> 00:09:06,130
That's the only possibility
I'm prepared for.

194
00:09:08,105 --> 00:09:08,722
Mm.

195
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:12,250
Do you use moisturizer ?
Here. Take this.

196
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:13,852
Keep it behind the bar.

197
00:09:15,428 --> 00:09:17,313
Wow. What is this ? It smells like
something burning.

198
00:09:17,365 --> 00:09:18,190
It's gingerbread.

199
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,411
Yeah.

200
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:23,163
You're not getting this, are you ?
Okay, this is 99 cents.

201
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:26,142
Okay ? You can buy anything
for 99 cents.

202
00:09:26,257 --> 00:09:26,783
Oh !

203
00:09:27,977 --> 00:09:28,583
Oh.

204
00:09:31,485 --> 00:09:32,091
It's small.

205
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:33,000
It's, um, 

206
00:09:33,045 --> 00:09:36,160
A tiny size. It has, uh,
cat-type creatures on it.

207
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,600
But it is a chair.

208
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:40,732
For 99 cents, you can buy furniture.
That is America, Man.

209
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:42,332
That's Taiwan, Man.

210
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:45,822
You know, this ferry thing's pretty bad.

211
00:09:45,828 --> 00:09:47,940
- Don't you think you should be...
- I am coping.

212
00:09:50,748 --> 00:09:51,110
Okay ?

213
00:09:55,668 --> 00:10:00,281
I'm coping. So, uh, shut up
and, uh, look at all my crap !

214
00:10:04,677 --> 00:10:07,292
Uh,  Callie, I'm putting you
in charge of my interns.

215
00:10:07,327 --> 00:10:08,600
Put'em to work anywhere but here.

216
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:09,682
Dr. Bailey, please let us stay here.

217
00:10:08,636 --> 00:10:10,661
- No, we can't go anywhere. We have to
- You're concerned.

218
00:10:10,705 --> 00:10:11,470
I understand.

219
00:10:11,506 --> 00:10:14,043
There's been a disaster
and there's work to be done.

220
00:10:14,118 --> 00:10:15,082
Go, now.

221
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:17,952
All right, they need bodies down
in the clinic. Let's go down there.

222
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,572
Hey, Bailey's right.
We can't help Meredith.

223
00:10:21,598 --> 00:10:22,623
All we can do is sit around
and go crazy.

224
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:23,053
I... I can't.

225
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:24,341
- I need to be here.
- Izzie,

226
00:10:24,798 --> 00:10:27,371
We're all freaked. We just need
to stay out of the way. Got it ?

227
00:10:28,535 --> 00:10:28,893
Let's go.

228
00:10:31,526 --> 00:10:35,071
Do you or your immediate family
have a history of cancer ?

229
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,411
Um, I don't know.

230
00:10:38,478 --> 00:10:40,742
How about heart disease
or high blood pressure ?

231
00:10:41,727 --> 00:10:44,282
How about alcohol or drug use ?
You don't know any of this, do you ?

232
00:10:44,316 --> 00:10:47,861
I don't even know the sex
of my baby or if I'm married.

233
00:10:47,925 --> 00:10:48,471
I mean, I...

234
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:50,902
I have a ring line, but

235
00:10:51,635 --> 00:10:52,393
I don't have the ring.

236
00:10:52,597 --> 00:10:53,582
So what does that make me ?

237
00:10:54,765 --> 00:10:56,280
I...  I don't know.

238
00:10:57,747 --> 00:10:58,742
Is it really bad ?

239
00:10:59,418 --> 00:11:01,873
You look... I mean, am I gonna...

240
00:11:02,016 --> 00:11:04,042
No. No, no, no, no, no. It's, uh...

241
00:11:05,736 --> 00:11:07,583
It's a friend.
She was in the accident, too.

242
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:09,062
Oh, I'm sorry.

243
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:10,762
Yeah. Well...

244
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:13,593
Things are tough all over.

245
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,433
I have no new information about
your loved ones. I'm sorry.

246
00:11:17,465 --> 00:11:20,703
But we are facing
a serious blood shortage.

247
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,163
So anyone eligible to donate
blood should see me.

248
00:11:23,398 --> 00:11:25,130
If you're not sure, see me.

249
00:11:25,808 --> 00:11:28,011
These need to go to the blood bank
for testing. Thanks.

250
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,172
What are those for ?

251
00:11:31,528 --> 00:11:32,483
Meredith is AB.

252
00:11:33,496 --> 00:11:36,142
She's been down a long time,
but, you know, she's strong.

253
00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:38,310
- We shouldn't give up.
- I wasn't planning to, but thanks.

254
00:11:40,045 --> 00:11:40,602
Okay.

255
00:11:40,947 --> 00:11:44,582
Is this stress related, or am I doing
something specific to piss you off ?

256
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,233
Because believe me,
we need to pull together.

257
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:47,010
Not "we".

258
00:11:47,585 --> 00:11:47,822
What ?

259
00:11:47,978 --> 00:11:50,483
You keep going on about how "we" need
to do this for Meredith

260
00:11:50,558 --> 00:11:52,533
and how strong Meredith is,
like you know her.

261
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:54,500
- I do know her.
- No, George, Cristina and me,

262
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,223
we know her.
We're her family.

263
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,311
We were here long before you and
George started fooling around.

264
00:11:58,337 --> 00:11:59,423
Hey, he is my husband.

265
00:11:59,346 --> 00:12:01,813
Stop saying that like it means
something. It's a piece of paper

266
00:12:01,877 --> 00:12:04,401
You act like it gives you history
or weight.

267
00:12:05,175 --> 00:12:06,220
Okay, enough !

268
00:12:06,468 --> 00:12:07,162
Enough.

269
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:09,942
I will not be run off. I am here.
George wants me here.

270
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:10,980
And if you can accept that,

271
00:12:11,086 --> 00:12:14,351
That... that I love him, too, then maybe
we could be, I don't know, friends ?

272
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,260
Or you can keep on the way you are

273
00:12:18,557 --> 00:12:20,333
and be that person that
George used to know.

274
00:12:20,637 --> 00:12:21,821
You don't get to decide that.

275
00:12:22,138 --> 00:12:24,211
- George decides.
- Oh, I know what he'll decide.

276
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:26,861
And if I were you, I would think about
it long and hard, because you

277
00:12:26,897 --> 00:12:29,792
cannot afford to lose another friend,
not when people around you keep...

278
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:33,392
Keep...

279
00:12:34,396 --> 00:12:35,482
Dropping like flies.

280
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:36,732
Is that what you were about to say ?

281
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,172
So all of you just disappear at will ?

282
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:45,721
- What happened ?
- I drowned.

283
00:12:45,835 --> 00:12:46,603
That's it.

284
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:47,521
Really ?

285
00:12:47,796 --> 00:12:49,042
Then why are we here ?

286
00:12:49,217 --> 00:12:49,743
Again.

287
00:12:51,476 --> 00:12:54,182
I can't do this if you're gonna
keep saying you drowned.

288
00:12:54,228 --> 00:12:56,261
Do you have any idea
how much that hurt ?

289
00:12:56,285 --> 00:12:57,903
You know, when you came into the E.R.,

290
00:12:58,057 --> 00:12:59,430
You were so brave,

291
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,890
- So strong.
- I was in shock !

292
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,922
And you guys doped me up.

293
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:05,160
And you know what ?

294
00:13:05,248 --> 00:13:08,820
In retrospect, what happened
to me really sucked.

295
00:13:09,615 --> 00:13:12,440
I was young and beautiful and in love.

296
00:13:12,577 --> 00:13:15,853
I was getting married in four months,
and then I was dying.

297
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:19,101
And here you are, all happy
and perky to be dead.

298
00:13:19,137 --> 00:13:20,473
You think I want to be here ?

299
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:22,821
I swam. I fought hard.

300
00:13:22,848 --> 00:13:25,172
- The water was cold.
- All right, but that thing in the tub,

301
00:13:25,698 --> 00:13:26,272
What was that ?

302
00:13:26,378 --> 00:13:27,860
It wasn't anything. It was...

303
00:13:28,755 --> 00:13:29,850
You see me in the tub ?

304
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,920
I do not see women in the bathtub.
I wish I saw w...

305
00:13:35,406 --> 00:13:37,792
- We know things.
- You had to think about it.

306
00:13:37,845 --> 00:13:40,603
- No daughter of Ellis Grey could...
- This is so not an Ellis Grey thing.

307
00:13:40,638 --> 00:13:43,181
- Ah, it's a Derek thing.
- I would never...
- You would.

308
00:13:43,676 --> 00:13:45,743
I know crappy things
have happened to you,

309
00:13:45,778 --> 00:13:50,030
But how can you be a surgeon and have
so little respect for life ? How...

310
00:13:51,108 --> 00:13:53,770
Oh, come on.

311
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:06,153
Who are you here for ?

312
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:09,703
What ?

313
00:14:10,127 --> 00:14:11,331
I'm waiting on my wife.

314
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:12,300
Car hit her.

315
00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:15,412
Can you believe that, on the ferry ?

316
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,462
She was run over on the ferry.

317
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:21,873
They haven't said much.

318
00:14:22,798 --> 00:14:25,140
Hard as hell to get any of
these people to talk to you.

319
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:26,091
Yeah, I'm, uh...

320
00:14:29,187 --> 00:14:30,401
My girlfriend was there, too.

321
00:14:32,365 --> 00:14:33,303
And I don't know...

322
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:36,312
I don't know what's gonna happen.

323
00:14:37,228 --> 00:14:38,310
It's out of our hands.

324
00:14:40,238 --> 00:14:41,570
It's up to the Doctors now.

325
00:14:42,546 --> 00:14:42,880
Yeah.

326
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:44,713
yeah.

327
00:14:48,747 --> 00:14:49,551
What's her name ?

328
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,120
Meredith.

329
00:14:55,397 --> 00:14:56,502
I'll put her in my prayers.

330
00:14:58,657 --> 00:14:59,083
Thanks.

331
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:15,371
I need to get in there and find
the source of this bleeding.

332
00:15:15,395 --> 00:15:17,293
Honestly, Mer, It's...
It's just gonna happen again.

333
00:15:17,326 --> 00:15:19,513
Where is something
to wipe up this blood ?

334
00:15:25,775 --> 00:15:26,711
Fool me once...

335
00:15:26,996 --> 00:15:29,521
Oh, good, yeah. Show up now,
be a smart-ass.

336
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,501
We have a job to do. Where are you ?

337
00:15:31,527 --> 00:15:33,372
You know, It's a waste of time.
She's either gonna get it

338
00:15:33,518 --> 00:15:34,462
- or she's not.
- Get what ?

339
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:37,103
The way I see it, it doesn't
matter how you got here.

340
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,483
You're either in this thing
or you're not.

341
00:15:39,597 --> 00:15:40,890
There is no in between.

342
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:42,941
And cowboy here can get pissed off,

343
00:15:43,165 --> 00:15:44,981
because for all his tough talk,

344
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:46,352
He's no different from Bonnie.

345
00:15:46,856 --> 00:15:48,463
- He's stuck.
- And you're not ?

346
00:15:48,516 --> 00:15:49,980
- No.
- Oh, please.
- Stop.

347
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,503
I had a good life.
I helped when I could.

348
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:56,001
And when that shell went off in my
hands, I completed my task.

349
00:15:56,838 --> 00:15:57,780
I saved you.

350
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,692
What about another epi ?

351
00:16:05,728 --> 00:16:08,083
We've been pushing epi for
an hour and a half now.

352
00:16:08,098 --> 00:16:08,992
Check another lead.

353
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:15,031
Asystole on three leads, sir.

354
00:16:15,146 --> 00:16:17,511
- What about her temp ?
- Down to 86 degrees.

355
00:16:17,588 --> 00:16:18,311
86 ? 

356
00:16:18,998 --> 00:16:22,593
- It's 86 now ? It was 89.
- Afterdrop phenomenon.

357
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:49,760
Water. Get me some water.

358
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:11,363
You broke her.

359
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,822
You call her ordinary.

360
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:17,453
You taught her time and time again
that nothing she does,

361
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:19,350
Ever, is good enough.

362
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,752
Every good thing Meredith is...

363
00:17:22,426 --> 00:17:23,171
H appened

364
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:24,470
Despite you.

365
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:26,463
She may not survive this,

366
00:17:27,126 --> 00:17:27,911
And that's on you.

367
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:30,370
- That is on you.
- Derek.

368
00:17:36,308 --> 00:17:36,701
The woman is just...

369
00:17:36,715 --> 00:17:38,680
She's a black hole,
there's no question.

370
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:41,690
But she can't help herself, and she
certainly can't fix Meredith.

371
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:42,651
It's my fault.

372
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:43,820
Don't.

373
00:17:43,838 --> 00:17:45,601
See, I knew what was going on,
and I wasn't there for her.

374
00:17:45,638 --> 00:17:46,530
You were human.

375
00:17:46,546 --> 00:17:49,331
She was pulling away from me,
and I just... I...

376
00:17:49,895 --> 00:17:50,511
I just...

377
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,671
Y... you think that she went
in the water on purpose ?

378
00:17:56,236 --> 00:17:57,151
She knows how to swim.

379
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:00,753
She's a good swimmer.

380
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:05,732
Derek, you don't know that she's...

381
00:18:06,597 --> 00:18:09,742
No, you do not get to break down.
You do not get to fall apart,

382
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:13,150
Not when there's still a chance, and
there still is a chance, Derek. Okay ?

383
00:18:15,735 --> 00:18:16,250
Okay.

384
00:18:19,357 --> 00:18:19,873
Okay.

385
00:18:30,827 --> 00:18:31,840
What are you looking for ?

386
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,223
Something strong.

387
00:18:33,555 --> 00:18:35,190
The next time Bonnie decides
to bleed out,

388
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:37,862
- I'm gonna dope her to high heaven and
- Why are we still talking about her ?

389
00:18:37,878 --> 00:18:40,763
- If I can find the source...
- She can't be saved.

390
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:43,211
This isn't fair. I could save her.

391
00:18:43,268 --> 00:18:46,263
If you'd just give me a chance,
I could save her.

392
00:18:48,445 --> 00:18:49,640
What happened in that water ?

393
00:18:49,685 --> 00:18:52,433
- I swam. I fought.
- No, you didn't.

394
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:56,843
- And you can't stay here, Meredith.
- I don't want to !

395
00:18:56,888 --> 00:18:58,492
Yeah, you do.

396
00:19:00,328 --> 00:19:01,261
It's easier.

397
00:19:02,127 --> 00:19:05,141
But you can't, because
George's dad died,

398
00:19:05,217 --> 00:19:06,531
Because Izzie lost me.

399
00:19:06,637 --> 00:19:07,603
And Cristina ?

400
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:11,360
When she was 9, she was in a
car accident with her father,

401
00:19:11,436 --> 00:19:12,760
And he bled out right in front of her

402
00:19:12,765 --> 00:19:14,450
while they waited for
an ambulance to arrive.

403
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,430
- And Alex...
- Stop.

404
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:17,152
They are barely breathing.

405
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:18,830
This will break them.

406
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,492
And none of them deserves that.

407
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:23,343
And this...

408
00:19:24,937 --> 00:19:25,963
This is the big one...

409
00:19:27,465 --> 00:19:28,680
So you pay attention.

410
00:19:29,406 --> 00:19:31,741
Do you know what kind of miracle it is

411
00:19:32,176 --> 00:19:34,261
That Derek is who he is ?

412
00:19:34,585 --> 00:19:37,853
Do you know how rare it is that
someone like him even exists ?

413
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:39,990
He's still an optimist.

414
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,770
He still believes in

415
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,593
true love and magic and...

416
00:19:45,187 --> 00:19:46,263
Soul mates.

417
00:19:46,408 --> 00:19:47,640
He's waiting for you,

418
00:19:47,765 --> 00:19:49,641
And if you don't come back from this,

419
00:19:50,935 --> 00:19:52,623
You will change who he is.

420
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,192
Oh, god.

421
00:20:10,805 --> 00:20:11,530
Oh.

422
00:20:24,908 --> 00:20:25,702
Code blue.

423
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:37,752
What about a cardiopulmonary bypass ?

424
00:20:38,877 --> 00:20:40,070
Come on. We could do it here.

425
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:47,050
Page Burke and the surgical team.
Get him here now.

426
00:20:50,377 --> 00:20:53,043
You know, this is... this is
quality suku, Joe. This is, like,

427
00:20:53,055 --> 00:20:54,981
- $2 worth of sudoku.
- Good to know.

428
00:21:00,305 --> 00:21:01,251
No change.

429
00:21:01,977 --> 00:21:03,582
- I thought you should know.
- No kidding.

430
00:21:04,005 --> 00:21:05,833
Well, some do, you know,
come back from this.

431
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,380
You know what ? I am not a civilian.
I know the science here.

432
00:21:08,496 --> 00:21:10,393
- It's drinking time.
- Not yet.

433
00:21:10,497 --> 00:21:12,392
You have a responsibility to Meredith.

434
00:21:13,026 --> 00:21:13,642
Unh-unh.

435
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:14,801
I don't do this stuff.

436
00:21:15,248 --> 00:21:16,821
I mean, you should know. 
I go to great lengths.

437
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:17,900
You were there when I needed you.

438
00:21:18,018 --> 00:21:18,542
After.

439
00:21:20,678 --> 00:21:22,373
After I knew you were gonna make it.

440
00:21:24,415 --> 00:21:25,303
Okay, I'm not proud.

441
00:21:27,058 --> 00:21:27,860
Okay ? I just...

442
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:30,993
I can't.

443
00:21:33,365 --> 00:21:36,570
I can't go back there. I can't...
I can't go back there and watch her...

444
00:21:42,015 --> 00:21:42,861
Listen to me.

445
00:21:45,136 --> 00:21:48,453
This is about you and the woman
you call your "person."

446
00:21:48,606 --> 00:21:50,031
And you do know the science here.

447
00:21:50,455 --> 00:21:53,771
And if she dies, and you are sitting
here when that happens,

448
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,081
I can't see you coming back from that.

449
00:21:58,158 --> 00:21:59,981
Come and say good-bye to your friend.

450
00:22:10,068 --> 00:22:11,592
I was swimming.

451
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:13,392
I was fighting.

452
00:22:15,616 --> 00:22:16,910
And then I thought...

453
00:22:17,165 --> 00:22:19,962
Just for a second...
I thought...

454
00:22:22,997 --> 00:22:23,981
What's the point ?

455
00:22:27,506 --> 00:22:28,471
And I let go.

456
00:22:30,755 --> 00:22:31,762
I stopped fighting.

457
00:22:35,765 --> 00:22:37,522
Don't tell anybody.

458
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:57,642
What ?

459
00:23:04,888 --> 00:23:05,732
Izzie.

460
00:23:06,157 --> 00:23:07,183
You can see her ?

461
00:23:08,468 --> 00:23:09,031
No.

462
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:12,452
But sometimes...

463
00:23:13,846 --> 00:23:15,641
We'll be in the same place

464
00:23:16,215 --> 00:23:18,220
At exactly the same time.

465
00:23:19,678 --> 00:23:20,391
And...

466
00:23:21,425 --> 00:23:24,022
Oh, I can almost hear her voice.

467
00:23:26,517 --> 00:23:27,923
It's like I'm touching her.

468
00:23:29,356 --> 00:23:31,753
I like to believe she knows I'm there.

469
00:23:37,948 --> 00:23:38,890
That's all you get,

470
00:23:40,447 --> 00:23:41,083
That's it,

471
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:43,293
Moments with the people you love.

472
00:23:43,457 --> 00:23:44,592
And they'll move on.

473
00:23:44,736 --> 00:23:46,531
And you'll want them to move on.

474
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:47,863
But still, Meredith,

475
00:23:47,946 --> 00:23:50,843
That is all you get, moments.

476
00:23:51,357 --> 00:23:52,680
Is this really happening ?

477
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:53,963
I don't know.

478
00:23:55,228 --> 00:23:57,120
This is your afterlife, not mine.

479
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:15,821
Any change ?

480
00:24:16,158 --> 00:24:16,572
No.

481
00:24:18,388 --> 00:24:19,682
George, come on.

482
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,431
- We can't do this today, not today.
- What the hell did you say to my wife ?

483
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:25,033
- I didn't say anything. We both said
things. She was...
- I saw her face. I saw her face.

484
00:24:25,056 --> 00:24:27,892
She didn't say anything, but why ? Why
would you pick now to throw down ?

485
00:24:27,906 --> 00:24:28,483
I didn't.

486
00:24:29,257 --> 00:24:29,531
I...

487
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,372
- I can't lie about how I feel.
- Actually, you can.

488
00:24:33,617 --> 00:24:35,260
You can. People lie all the time.

489
00:24:35,985 --> 00:24:37,573
They hold their tongues and they wait.

490
00:24:37,587 --> 00:24:39,410
You should hold your tongue because
if I'm not making a mistake,

491
00:24:39,425 --> 00:24:41,770
You're gonna look like a jerk, and if
I am, I'm gonna need you.

492
00:24:42,678 --> 00:24:43,300
I need you,

493
00:24:43,898 --> 00:24:45,481
And you... you keep taking that away.

494
00:24:53,887 --> 00:24:55,152
Place the C02 monitor.

495
00:24:55,268 --> 00:24:56,041
Did you page Dr. Burke ?

496
00:24:56,065 --> 00:24:58,293
He's in trauma doing
cardiopulmonary bypass.

497
00:24:59,258 --> 00:25:00,160
On Meredith Grey ?

498
00:25:00,587 --> 00:25:01,101
Yes, sir.

499
00:25:02,747 --> 00:25:04,502
All right. Okay, push 1 of atropine.

500
00:25:07,637 --> 00:25:08,942
Billy, what's her temp ?

501
00:25:09,096 --> 00:25:10,250
We're up to 96.

502
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:13,041
That's good. Good.

503
00:25:13,255 --> 00:25:13,621
All right.

504
00:25:13,698 --> 00:25:15,202
Now we just have to get
her heart beating.

505
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:19,302
Okay, draw an A.B.G. Push 1 of epi,
a gram of mag and an amp of calcium.

506
00:25:19,808 --> 00:25:22,121
I don't want to be here.
I want to go back.

507
00:25:22,168 --> 00:25:23,971
We were told there
wasn't a lot of time.

508
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:24,950
I'm out of time ?

509
00:25:25,007 --> 00:25:28,022
- Well, we're not sure, baby.
- Oh, god.

510
00:25:28,076 --> 00:25:29,390
I can't...

511
00:25:29,587 --> 00:25:32,043
I w... oh. I... I... I

512
00:25:32,075 --> 00:25:34,482
- I had intimacy issues.
- Yeah.

513
00:25:34,548 --> 00:25:36,982
Do you know how stupid that seems now ?

514
00:25:37,005 --> 00:25:39,423
- Yeah, I do.
- It's not enough.

515
00:25:39,546 --> 00:25:44,352
It's not enough, just a whiff of Derek
or just... or Cristina.

516
00:25:44,686 --> 00:25:47,392
I need to go back. Please.

517
00:25:47,686 --> 00:25:49,993
I can't... I can't...

518
00:25:53,046 --> 00:25:54,462
This is not gonna happen,
not today.

519
00:25:54,506 --> 00:25:55,831
You're not gonna die on me
today, not today.

520
00:25:56,777 --> 00:25:57,212
v-fib.

521
00:25:57,398 --> 00:25:58,340
Give me the paddles.

522
00:26:01,365 --> 00:26:01,662
Clear

523
00:26:03,726 --> 00:26:05,363
- How many epis is that ?
- Six.

524
00:26:05,425 --> 00:26:06,493
What's the external pacer ?

525
00:26:06,657 --> 00:26:07,363
It's not catching.

526
00:26:07,527 --> 00:26:09,133
- Billy, what's her body temp ?
- 98.

527
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:10,282
So she's warm ?

528
00:26:10,846 --> 00:26:11,353
Yes.

529
00:26:19,316 --> 00:26:20,343
and dead.

530
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:31,103
V-fib.

531
00:26:31,485 --> 00:26:32,390
That looks like v-fib.

532
00:26:32,685 --> 00:26:33,711
Shock her at 300.

533
00:26:34,517 --> 00:26:36,141
- Charged.
- Clear.

534
00:26:43,658 --> 00:26:47,550
You cannot give up. You understand me ?
Do you know how much time

535
00:26:47,808 --> 00:26:51,993
and effort and energy and... and...
and resources and drugs...

536
00:26:54,686 --> 00:26:56,262
You cannot give up.

537
00:26:59,647 --> 00:27:01,930
Turning the pacer up to max.

538
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:07,230
If there was any ounce of activity,
the pacer would've picked it up.

539
00:27:18,685 --> 00:27:20,870
she's been on bypass for...

540
00:27:22,127 --> 00:27:23,771
almost an hour.

541
00:27:38,596 --> 00:27:40,551
Cristina.

542
00:27:52,687 --> 00:27:54,002
I can't breathe.

543
00:27:54,198 --> 00:27:56,570
- This will pass.
- It wontT.

544
00:27:56,646 --> 00:27:58,930
It feels like...

545
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:06,360
Mom ?

546
00:28:23,678 --> 00:28:23,960
Go.

547
00:28:26,146 --> 00:28:27,352
Go, Meredith.

548
00:28:51,586 --> 00:28:53,360
Try again.

549
00:28:58,185 --> 00:28:59,380
Try again !

550
00:29:09,587 --> 00:29:12,933
Okay, one more round
of A.C.L.S. Drugs ?

551
00:29:14,578 --> 00:29:15,562
One more.

552
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:27,181
Still v-fib. Okay charge to 300.

553
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:28,832
Clear.

554
00:29:40,435 --> 00:29:41,683
You shouldn't be here.

555
00:29:44,776 --> 00:29:46,721
Neither should you.

556
00:29:46,948 --> 00:29:51,631
Just keep going.
Don't be a damn...

557
00:30:02,338 --> 00:30:03,232
You are...

558
00:30:05,225 --> 00:30:09,342
You are anything but ordinary, Meredith.

559
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:23,013
Now run.

560
00:30:24,185 --> 00:30:24,911
Run.

561
00:30:30,118 --> 00:30:31,302
- Is the lidocaine in ?
- Yes.

562
00:30:31,938 --> 00:30:33,052
Okay, holding compressions.

563
00:30:33,895 --> 00:30:34,562
Come on.

564
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:36,551
Come on, Ellis. Come on.

565
00:31:02,338 --> 00:31:03,592
- Sinus brady.
- Okay

566
00:31:03,705 --> 00:31:04,603
We got a heartbeat ?

567
00:31:09,315 --> 00:31:09,953
We got it.

568
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:38,683
She's breathing on her own ?

569
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,331
She is.

570
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:45,923
She's been down a long time.

571
00:31:47,298 --> 00:31:48,611
Do we know the brain function yet ?

572
00:31:49,128 --> 00:31:50,271
We don't know.

573
00:31:51,448 --> 00:31:54,492
- Derek, does, um...
- I haven't paged him yet. I wanted to

574
00:31:58,317 --> 00:32:00,012
I'm giving her more time.

575
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:30,823
Did you say something ?
Did you just speak ?

576
00:32:32,267 --> 00:32:32,700
Oh.

577
00:32:34,037 --> 00:32:35,913
Mer, I don't understand you.
Okay ? Try...

578
00:32:36,305 --> 00:32:38,720
Try again. Try again...
Try again for me, okay ?

579
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,290
What ? I,

580
00:32:45,185 --> 00:32:46,190
I can't...

581
00:32:48,356 --> 00:32:50,353
Please, please don't be...

582
00:32:54,647 --> 00:32:55,760
Your brain works.

583
00:32:55,966 --> 00:32:58,622
Okay ? So all you need
to do is form a word.

584
00:32:59,207 --> 00:33:00,063
Please.

585
00:33:06,646 --> 00:33:07,652
Ouch.

586
00:33:19,358 --> 00:33:21,080
Oh, god.

587
00:33:24,545 --> 00:33:25,051
Hi.

588
00:33:26,707 --> 00:33:28,263
I'm getting married to Burke.

589
00:33:28,808 --> 00:33:30,231
Not that that should be anywhere

590
00:33:30,315 --> 00:33:31,483
on your list of thoughts right now,

591
00:33:31,525 --> 00:33:33,890
but just in case you slip
in the hall later or...

592
00:33:39,106 --> 00:33:41,653
You are the one person I wanted to tell.

593
00:33:45,498 --> 00:33:50,512
Thank you for not dying.

594
00:33:52,755 --> 00:33:53,423
Hey.

595
00:34:44,896 --> 00:34:45,542
Hey.

596
00:34:47,556 --> 00:34:48,531
Hey.

597
00:35:10,646 --> 00:35:11,780
Meredith...

598
00:35:13,037 --> 00:35:14,913
My mother's dead, isn't she ?

599
00:35:18,145 --> 00:35:19,123
Yes.

600
00:35:22,217 --> 00:35:23,373
It's okay...

601
00:35:25,615 --> 00:35:26,551
I think.

602
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,270
I think it's okay.

603
00:35:47,917 --> 00:35:49,481
So she's okay ?

604
00:35:52,245 --> 00:35:52,841
Yeah.

605
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:58,350
We never had that.
He never...

606
00:35:59,085 --> 00:36:01,543
felt that way about me.

607
00:36:04,008 --> 00:36:05,353
I did.

608
00:36:09,195 --> 00:36:12,970
You know, sometimes I think what a waste
it is to throw away all that history.

609
00:36:13,347 --> 00:36:14,321
I'm flawed.

610
00:36:15,295 --> 00:36:16,090
I'm a

611
00:36:16,787 --> 00:36:17,502
a wreck.

612
00:36:18,478 --> 00:36:19,160
But you...

613
00:36:20,227 --> 00:36:21,051
it wasn't a game.

614
00:36:26,495 --> 00:36:27,892
60 days.

615
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:34,851
Go 60 days with no sex, no other women.
60 days cold turky, then maybe

616
00:36:35,258 --> 00:36:36,141
I'll believe you.

617
00:36:36,545 --> 00:36:39,121
- So I only have sex with you.
- No.

618
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:42,212
No sex with anyone.

619
00:36:42,557 --> 00:36:43,560
Grow up, mark.

620
00:36:44,137 --> 00:36:46,282
- Find another way to scratch the itch.
- Say I do.

621
00:36:46,476 --> 00:36:47,460
You'll give us a try,

622
00:36:47,777 --> 00:36:51,073
a real try ? The couple thing...
no sneaking around, no booty calls ?

623
00:36:51,118 --> 00:36:52,162
If you make it, yes.

624
00:36:53,168 --> 00:36:53,623
Okay.

625
00:36:54,688 --> 00:36:55,290
We're on.

626
00:36:57,446 --> 00:37:00,781
Oh, and, Addison ? If I'm not having
sex, neither are you.

627
00:37:01,376 --> 00:37:03,582
Who would I possibly
be having sex with ?

628
00:37:09,056 --> 00:37:09,921
How you doing ?

629
00:37:10,126 --> 00:37:12,051
I hurt all over.

630
00:37:12,947 --> 00:37:15,572
- How's your friend ?
- Well, she pulled through.

631
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,292
Good. That's great.

632
00:37:18,707 --> 00:37:21,841
- And... nobody's...
- Claimed you ? No

633
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:22,783
No, nothing yet.

634
00:37:23,127 --> 00:37:24,552
So we still don't know anything ?

635
00:37:24,717 --> 00:37:25,690
Oh, oh, no,

636
00:37:25,908 --> 00:37:28,640
not so. We, uh, learned a lot
about you today.

637
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,021
Well, we know that
your heart is healthy.

638
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:34,163
We know that your blood type
is b-positive.

639
00:37:34,788 --> 00:37:36,170
you probably eat pretty
healthy, because

640
00:37:36,195 --> 00:37:38,500
your cholesterol level is excellent
and you're not diabetic.

641
00:37:38,568 --> 00:37:40,320
Your lungs don't look like
smoker's lungs,

642
00:37:40,505 --> 00:37:42,862
and you don't drink alcohol
on ferries in the morning.

643
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,583
And you're about, uh,

644
00:37:45,918 --> 00:37:48,910
32 years old.

645
00:37:49,898 --> 00:37:51,631
And your baby is a girl.

646
00:37:56,538 --> 00:38:00,243
Really ? A girl ?

647
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:01,851
Yeah.

648
00:38:10,356 --> 00:38:13,760
- and I think I am married.
I feel married.
- Yeah ?

649
00:38:14,596 --> 00:38:15,340
Yeah.

650
00:38:15,706 --> 00:38:18,153
See, now I know more about you
than some of my closest friends.

651
00:38:21,436 --> 00:38:22,372
That's pathetic.

652
00:38:26,567 --> 00:38:27,412
Held it down.

653
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:28,501
Thanks.

654
00:38:29,868 --> 00:38:31,511
What you did today
with Meredith...

655
00:38:32,496 --> 00:38:33,621
everybody's talking.

656
00:38:33,995 --> 00:38:35,183
Chief resident talk.

657
00:38:36,445 --> 00:38:37,242
Okay, I'm talking...

658
00:38:37,775 --> 00:38:38,801
to myself... But...

659
00:38:40,086 --> 00:38:42,760
you're gonna give me
a run for my money.

660
00:38:47,145 --> 00:38:48,710
Yeah, I am.

661
00:38:59,615 --> 00:39:00,733
I let you down.

662
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:04,571
And I get it if you
don't trust me right now. Bur...

663
00:39:08,435 --> 00:39:09,410
please, George.

664
00:39:11,486 --> 00:39:12,352
It's me.

665
00:39:13,626 --> 00:39:14,742
It's us.

666
00:39:18,026 --> 00:39:19,280
Please.

667
00:39:27,246 --> 00:39:28,893
<i>At the end of a day like this,<i>

668
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,802
<i>a day when so many prayers are answered<i>

669
00:39:32,717 --> 00:39:33,772
<i>and so many aren't...<i>

670
00:39:38,678 --> 00:39:39,971
you've been gone a long time.

671
00:39:43,908 --> 00:39:46,782
I know you think you died
when the Alzheimer's started.

672
00:39:50,267 --> 00:39:51,801
I know it's a relief to you.

673
00:39:54,486 --> 00:39:55,791
I know.

674
00:39:58,158 --> 00:40:00,691
But it doesn't feel like a relief to me.

675
00:40:03,495 --> 00:40:05,321
I'm not relieved.

676
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:10,480
I miss the sound of your voice.

677
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,803
I miss talking to you.

678
00:40:17,475 --> 00:40:19,311
I miss you.

679
00:40:29,356 --> 00:40:32,121
I dyed my hair...

680
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:36,562
for the ladies.

681
00:40:54,307 --> 00:40:56,803
<i>We take our miracles where we find them.<i>

682
00:40:59,158 --> 00:41:00,831
<i>We reach across the gap...<i>

683
00:41:02,765 --> 00:41:04,412
<i>and sometimes...<i>

684
00:41:05,276 --> 00:41:06,952

685
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,611
