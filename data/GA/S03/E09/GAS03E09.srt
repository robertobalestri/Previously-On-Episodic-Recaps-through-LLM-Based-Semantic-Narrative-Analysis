1
00:00:00,857 --> 00:00:02,563
Previously on "grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,758 --> 00:00:03,699
- O'Malley.
- what ?

3
00:00:03,883 --> 00:00:05,630
George's dad got admitted last night.

4
00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:07,700
It's just a valve replacement, George.

5
00:00:07,739 --> 00:00:10,150
Burke will do it, and you will clear
his schedule.

6
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:12,625
If someone is gonna operate on my
dad's heart, I want it to be Burke.

7
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:15,242
Dr. Hahn here graduated second.

8
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:17,315
Ask her who graduated first.

9
00:00:17,409 --> 00:00:20,506
Adele and I...
she wants me to stop down as chief, retire.

10
00:00:20,577 --> 00:00:22,060
We're starting fresh.

11
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,478
And starting fresh means no sex because ?

12
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:28,254
Because we started with sex last time,
and it didn't go very well.

13
00:00:28,316 --> 00:00:30,053
You decannulated a heart this morning.

14
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:31,210
- I didn't decannulate--
- Yes, you did.

15
00:00:31,496 --> 00:00:35,852
And when Burke and I were fishing,
I noticed something weird with his hand.

16
00:00:36,317 --> 00:00:38,561
I slept with another guy.
Do I tell george ?

17
00:00:38,637 --> 00:00:39,942
Callie slept with sloan.

18
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:41,671
I spent the entire day worrying
about Burke.

19
00:00:41,818 --> 00:00:42,722
Burke is fine.

20
00:00:42,747 --> 00:00:45,032
- Your dad will be fine.
- You're lying.

21
00:00:45,177 --> 00:00:47,391
Burke is hiding something,
and you're helping him.

22
00:00:47,587 --> 00:00:49,532
George knows.

23
00:00:55,946 --> 00:00:57,422
Cirstina : As doctors...

24
00:00:58,795 --> 00:01:01,013
we know everybody's secrets--

25
00:01:01,448 --> 00:01:03,800
their medical histories...

26
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:06,030
sexual histories...

27
00:01:06,765 --> 00:01:10,853
confidential information
that is as essential to a surgeon

28
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:12,690
as a 10-blade...

29
00:01:15,227 --> 00:01:17,462
and every bit as dangerous.

30
00:01:20,198 --> 00:01:23,252
we keep secrets.
We have to.

31
00:01:29,776 --> 00:01:32,892
but not all secrets can be kept.

32
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:51,651
6-letter word for pinnacle.

33
00:01:53,218 --> 00:01:55,350
- Zenith.
- Oh, this is good.

34
00:01:55,668 --> 00:01:58,400
No sex, crossword puzzles,
current events--

35
00:01:58,716 --> 00:02:00,571
when's the knitting start ?

36
00:02:01,098 --> 00:02:01,843
shut up.

37
00:02:01,957 --> 00:02:03,723
Good things come to those who wait.

38
00:02:03,808 --> 00:02:05,360
Yeah ? I want sex.

39
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,001
- there will be no sex.
- Am I interrupting sex ?

40
00:02:09,427 --> 00:02:10,101
No.

41
00:02:10,248 --> 00:02:12,331
- Good. Get out.
- What ? You can't ask me to leave.

42
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:12,870
Meredith.

43
00:02:17,315 --> 00:02:20,613
give us a sec.

44
00:02:20,825 --> 00:02:22,653
When I get back,
there'd better be some sex.

45
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,640
- Why are you all sweaty and ick ?
- I jogged here.

46
00:02:26,718 --> 00:02:29,083
We don't jog. You jog.

47
00:02:32,665 --> 00:02:35,452
- Cristina--
- what if derek robbed a bank ?

48
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:36,462
What ?

49
00:02:36,587 --> 00:02:38,931
Say Derek was robbing a bank,
and while he was in there,

50
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:42,132
you were waiting outside because it was
your job to drive the getaway car.

51
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:44,181
- Why would Derek rob a bank ?
- Just go with me, please.

52
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:46,313
- Okay, Derek's robbing a bank.
- And he gets caught.

53
00:02:46,728 --> 00:02:47,952
But no one knows you were involved

54
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:49,510
'cause you were driving the car.

55
00:02:49,945 --> 00:02:53,073
Okay, Derek's in jail, I'm in the
mystery car. What's the question ?

56
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:54,532
Would you turn yourself in,

57
00:02:55,285 --> 00:02:59,431
or would you stay quiet and let
Derek go down for a robbery in which
you were a complicit participant ?

58
00:02:59,656 --> 00:03:01,493
Or would you, you know, stand by him ?

59
00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:05,552
Well... whose id was it to rob the bank ?

60
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:11,562
I don't know. I don't know.
His, but... you helped.

61
00:03:12,195 --> 00:03:13,731
I mean, could you live with yourself

62
00:03:14,505 --> 00:03:17,591
if you just walked away and let
the man you love take the fall ?

63
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:23,321
If you tell me, maybe I can help.

64
00:03:24,506 --> 00:03:28,223
- If you tell me--
- No, I'll see-- I'll see you at work.

65
00:03:29,587 --> 00:03:32,153
Cristina, you don't jog.

66
00:03:33,398 --> 00:03:35,241
We don't jog.

67
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:40,991
- Has George said anything to you ?
- About what ?

68
00:03:43,285 --> 00:03:47,621
I jog sometimes...
without you.

69
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,552
- How's your dad ?
- His surgery is today.

70
00:04:07,928 --> 00:04:11,072
- You have nothing to worry about.
- I'm not worried, not anymore.

71
00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:13,911
- What do you mean by that ?
- Hey.

72
00:04:14,447 --> 00:04:18,822
So are you and Meredith having one of your
"we're best friends, we're so cool"
secret time things ?

73
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:20,203
Sorry, I'm cranky.

74
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:22,710
Candy striping makes me so cranky.

75
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:25,092
- Cristina's leaving.
- Ah, so I can have my girlfriend back.

76
00:04:30,815 --> 00:04:33,452
What's wrong with her ?

77
00:04:44,807 --> 00:04:48,431
- Why are you acting like the sky is falling ?
- The sky isn't falling. It already fell.

78
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:52,132
- George knows.
- I was in surgery for 14 hours yesterday,

79
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:55,110
- and no tremor.
- Yeah, with me by your side, ready to jump in.

80
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:58,371
- I haven't had a tremor in a week.
- George knows.

81
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:01,292
And this is not any surgery.
You are operating on his father today.

82
00:05:01,185 --> 00:05:04,482
-  I am aware of that, and I am fine.
- Well, he's gonna do something.

83
00:05:04,548 --> 00:05:07,772
- I know him. He's not gonna just
stand by and say nothing.
- There's nothing to say.

84
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:09,712
I had a tremor. Now I don'T.

85
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,490
We need a strategy. We have to figure out
our story and come up with a plan.

86
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,200
Oh, Cristina,

87
00:05:16,515 --> 00:05:17,993
you're too intense.

88
00:05:18,547 --> 00:05:20,373
I am too intense ?

89
00:05:21,056 --> 00:05:24,662
I have been working my ass off
making sure nobody here knows,

90
00:05:24,756 --> 00:05:25,762
running your board,

91
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,983
- Learning surgical procedures I shouldn't
have to know until my fif year covering you.
- Covering me ?

92
00:05:31,088 --> 00:05:33,571
- And I haven't been covering you ?
- Excuse me ?

93
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:38,852
I'm just saying...
we're a team...

94
00:05:39,758 --> 00:05:43,901
- Okay.
- A strong team, and I wouldn't be in that
O.R. If I didn't know I could do it,

95
00:05:44,496 --> 00:05:45,920
- and you just have to trust me on that.

96
00:05:45,957 --> 00:05:48,761
- Don't let this O'Malley thing break you down.
- No, I'm not.

97
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:54,662
- Cristina--
- I gotta--I gotta go.

98
00:05:59,688 --> 00:06:02,760
- what happened ?
- Driver lost control of his car,

99
00:06:02,865 --> 00:06:06,100
plowed through the fish market at the warf.
At least a dozen injuries.

100
00:06:06,137 --> 00:06:08,003
- I need all hands on deck.
- All hands ?

101
00:06:08,198 --> 00:06:10,422
Does that mean "all hands,"
or just all hands ?

102
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:12,451
Stevens, uh, you shouldn't
have been paged.

103
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:17,100
You can go and take over on mr. O'malley.
He's having his surgery today with dr. Burke.

104
00:06:17,148 --> 00:06:21,060
- Uh, that's my case. I'm with burke.
You have traumas rolling into the pit.
She can take over for you.

105
00:06:21,218 --> 00:06:22,220
So I get to scrub in ?

106
00:06:22,535 --> 00:06:25,113
- Thanks.
- But--
- Stevens, you will not scrub in.

107
00:06:25,146 --> 00:06:27,011
You will not handle any instruments.

108
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,062
You will not move or talk or do anything
other than breathe and watch.

109
00:06:31,097 --> 00:06:33,083
Candy striping again. No problem.

110
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:36,913
- Where is george ? Why isn't he here ?
- I don't know. He switched shifts with me.

111
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:41,370
Dr. Bailey...
um, I just wanted to say,

112
00:06:41,596 --> 00:06:45,250
Dr. Burke requested me on the O'Malley
case, so if I have to go...

113
00:06:45,608 --> 00:06:47,651
I mean, Izzie can't even scrub in, so

114
00:06:47,978 --> 00:06:51,890
- if and when my attending asks for me--
- well, if and when your attending asks for you,

115
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:54,022
then you have to go, don't you ?

116
00:06:56,676 --> 00:07:00,362
Grey, trauma room one. Yang,
man that stretcher. Karev, come with me.

117
00:07:00,435 --> 00:07:01,163
All right, talk to me.

118
00:07:01,218 --> 00:07:04,832
Larry shane dickerson, 86, 
G.C.S. 8, B.P. Of 100 over palp,

119
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:07,643
- pulse in the 120s.
- Obvious deformities to the right tib/fib.

120
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,421
Get x-rays. Let me know
if there's anything surgical.

121
00:07:09,517 --> 00:07:11,683
Looks like he's got a lot worse
problems than a broken leg.

122
00:07:11,775 --> 00:07:13,840
Honey, let me hear your voice.

123
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,320
- That car, that car--
it just about killed him.
- The car hit him ?

124
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:21,023
No, he was driving. Hit his head on the
windshield, chest hit the steering column.

125
00:07:21,037 --> 00:07:22,003
Old car, no airbags.

126
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,422
He was driving the car that
crashed into the fish market ?

127
00:07:24,465 --> 00:07:26,441
He wasn't driving it.
That's what I'm telling you.

128
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:29,571
It  was driving him. He didn't
do all this. It was the car.

129
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:30,642
He couldn't stop it.

130
00:07:30,696 --> 00:07:33,002
Okay. Left pupil is sluggish.
Mrs. Dickerson,

131
00:07:33,205 --> 00:07:36,011
Dr. Yang is gonna take
your husband over to radiology.

132
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:38,501
And, mrs. Dickerson,
there are two police officers

133
00:07:38,576 --> 00:07:41,053
You see, he dropped me off, he went
to park like he always does.

134
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:45,533
Larry is a good driver.

135
00:07:45,678 --> 00:07:47,220
Please, I want to be with my husband.

136
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,772
- Yes, mrs. Dickerson, but just give the statement
- Not now !

137
00:07:50,578 --> 00:07:51,190
please.

138
00:07:53,927 --> 00:07:58,753
Okay, uh... all--all right,
I'll--I'll ask them to come back later

139
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:05,283
- He's crashing.
- I need suction here.

140
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:12,253
should we shock him again ?

141
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,440
Shocking is not gonna help
a heart with no blood to pump.

142
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:16,312
- Damn it.
- There are clots everywhere.

143
00:08:16,655 --> 00:08:17,850
If I could just get better
visualization...

144
00:08:17,862 --> 00:08:20,888
so you said you were inside of
the fish market when this happened ?

145
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:23,514
Okay, I need you to get her...

146
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,233
Ma'am ?

147
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:29,240
Ma'am ?

148
00:08:32,115 --> 00:08:35,973
- Call it, Grey.
- Time of death--7 :53 A.M.

149
00:08:37,147 --> 00:08:38,073
Ma'am ?

150
00:08:42,357 --> 00:08:47,143
Preston burke... back from the dead.

151
00:08:47,547 --> 00:08:50,723
- Can't say the same for your patient.
- Ma'am ?!

152
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:54,433
Ma-- I need a stretcher over here.

153
00:08:54,545 --> 00:08:59,330
- I think I might be parked in a red zone.
- Oh ! I need a stretcher, please !

154
00:09:09,995 --> 00:09:13,882
- Awesome cuts.
- I flew through a window.

155
00:09:13,955 --> 00:09:15,290
- I flew.
- Karev.

156
00:09:15,336 --> 00:09:17,612
Stop manhandling my intern.
That's my job.

157
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:19,791
- Can you tell me your name ?
- Janelle duco.

158
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,193
Janelle, what do you do for a living ?

159
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:24,012
- I sell vegetables at the fish market.
- Janelle

160
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:27,653
honey, can I get you anything ?
Some food maybe ?

161
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:29,082
Mrs. Dickerson, is that you ?

162
00:09:29,138 --> 00:09:31,373
Mrs. Dickerson, I'm sorry.
You can't be here right now.

163
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:32,570
Larry is a good driver.

164
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,312
The car went crazy.

165
00:09:34,376 --> 00:09:37,632
Janelle, if--if you need anything,
I'll be right over here.

166
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,341
She's my best customer.

167
00:09:39,605 --> 00:09:42,582
She collapsed in my arms.
I just want to make sure she's okay.

168
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,571
- You got it from here ?
They don't call me "doctor" for nothing.

169
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,673
Mr. Dickerson is such a nice man.

170
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:50,620
I hope he didn't kill my baby.

171
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,073
Addison ! She's pregnant.

172
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,520
I need an ultrasound.
How far along are you ?

173
00:09:57,637 --> 00:09:59,071
Ten weeks.
Ow !

174
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:02,211
- Sorry.
- There's glass in there, karev.
Try a lighter tough.

175
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:06,073
The doctors... hot men.

176
00:10:06,468 --> 00:10:09,661
They're all really hot.
They are, aren't they ?

177
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:12,430
- It's not just 'cause I'm wearing
a plate-glass window ?
- No

178
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:15,093
- they're man-candy.
- Good.

179
00:10:19,205 --> 00:10:21,463
okay, that is nasty.

180
00:10:21,517 --> 00:10:23,631
Her sats are in the 80s.
I've got to get her oxygen.

181
00:10:23,737 --> 00:10:26,142
And I'm gonna need a portable chest,
stat.

182
00:10:26,217 --> 00:10:27,301
I love the bossing.

183
00:10:27,785 --> 00:10:28,741
Boss more.

184
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:35,790
- hey, Izzie.
Honey, this is Izzie.

185
00:10:36,056 --> 00:10:37,432
- Hi.
- Oh, yes.

186
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,371
One  of the girls who lives with georgie

187
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:43,312
- in some kind of setup there.
- It's not some kind of setup.

188
00:10:43,485 --> 00:10:45,421
It's like what they do these days.

189
00:10:45,805 --> 00:10:49,701
Men and women live together
without being... you know

190
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:51,712
men and women.

191
00:10:51,937 --> 00:10:53,120
It's like a neutral thing, huh ?

192
00:10:53,345 --> 00:10:55,493
- So nothing sexual ?
- Mom !

193
00:10:56,275 --> 00:10:59,221
No. Nothing sexual.

194
00:10:59,385 --> 00:11:02,062
Where are the other O'Malley men today ?
I told 'em to get back to work.

195
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:03,781
They were climbing the walls in here.

196
00:11:03,915 --> 00:11:06,682
Well, I'm here to prep you for surgery.
As you know, dr. Burke is your surgeon.

197
00:11:06,748 --> 00:11:07,940
Dr. Burke--right.

198
00:11:08,088 --> 00:11:10,632
Georgie's always saying
"dr. Burke this, dr. Burke that."

199
00:11:10,687 --> 00:11:11,853
Yeah, he's pretty incredible.

200
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:14,240
he's one of the best cardiothoracic
guys in the world.

201
00:11:14,317 --> 00:11:14,962
yeah.

202
00:11:18,156 --> 00:11:20,333
Um, I have to go.
I'm gonna be right back.

203
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:22,120
You're not even working today.
Why are you getting paged ?

204
00:11:22,226 --> 00:11:23,220
I have to go.

205
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:26,600
You're pretty. 

206
00:11:27,296 --> 00:11:29,442
There's nothing sexual between
you and Georgie,

207
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,781
- not even a little bit ?
- Louise !

208
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:35,131
What ?
I just want Georgie to be happy.

209
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:38,941
Okay.
Let's just prep you for surgery.

210
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:41,180
Anything you would've
done different, dr. Hahn ?

211
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:43,552
Given the size of the wound,

212
00:11:43,798 --> 00:11:45,282
I would've given up sooner.

213
00:11:45,446 --> 00:11:49,842
So how have you been, Preston ?
Last time I saw you, you stole my patient's heart.

214
00:11:49,925 --> 00:11:51,052
Then  you got shot.

215
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,130
Karma rocks.

216
00:11:53,287 --> 00:11:56,511
What brings you all the way from
Seattle presbyterian to Seattle grace ?

217
00:11:56,568 --> 00:11:57,482
A consult,

218
00:11:57,705 --> 00:12:00,023
and knowing how much
my being here would annoy you.

219
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:01,220
Oh, on the contrary,

220
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:02,731
it's always a pleasure,

221
00:12:03,177 --> 00:12:05,723
but not as much as when you leave.

222
00:12:10,298 --> 00:12:13,263
Hey, do you think I could
get in on erica hahn's surgery ?

223
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:14,650
- I've heard she's amazing.
- Who ?

224
00:12:14,905 --> 00:12:15,762
Dr. Hahn.

225
00:12:15,855 --> 00:12:18,851
She's doing a consult.
I wonder who the V.I.P. Patient is.

226
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:27,512
Um, get him-- get him to C. T

227
00:12:30,775 --> 00:12:32,243
Maria, may I have my father's chart ?

228
00:12:32,346 --> 00:12:33,263
Dr. Hahn...

229
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,990
I was pleasantly surprised
to hear you were joining us today.

230
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:39,320
Oh, well, I'm always ready
to lend a hand, dr. Webber.

231
00:12:39,345 --> 00:12:39,953
George.

232
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,950
Hey, how's your dad ?

233
00:12:43,306 --> 00:12:47,520
Uh, here is his chart. He's in room 3975.
It's down the hall, third door on the right.

234
00:12:47,585 --> 00:12:48,883
- I'll be there in a minute.
- Okay.

235
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:49,711
I'll escort you,

236
00:12:49,858 --> 00:12:54,143
and you can tell me what it would take to
steal you away from seattle presbyterian.

237
00:12:54,427 --> 00:12:56,972
We  could use an extra hand around here.

238
00:12:58,998 --> 00:13:02,820
- Callie.
- Hey.

239
00:13:02,946 --> 00:13:05,650
We broke up. You broke up with me.
Unless I'm missing something ?

240
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:06,762
That doesn't mean...

241
00:13:07,408 --> 00:13:09,443
- I'm just asking about your dad.
- Why ?

242
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,400
Why do you care ?

243
00:13:11,926 --> 00:13:13,181
Because I care about you.

244
00:13:13,465 --> 00:13:16,512
Right. Well, I guess that's why
you slept with Mark Sloan, huh ?

245
00:13:16,706 --> 00:13:18,812
That makes sense.

246
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,863
Did dr. Bailey see the chest x-ray ?

247
00:13:27,897 --> 00:13:32,142
No, but with the decreased breath sounds
and the low pulse ox,
she suspects janelle will need a chest tube.

248
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:35,751
I'm dabbing out freakin' glass splinters,
and she gets to do a chest tube ?

249
00:13:36,045 --> 00:13:39,001
- You signed on for this.
- This is not a good day for me.

250
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:42,203
- This is not a good day for me at all.
- The baby looks good, janelle.

251
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:43,630
Heartbeat's strong.

252
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:45,482
- Do you want me to call the father ?
- You could do that,

253
00:13:45,537 --> 00:13:48,462
but that would require me speaking
to him, which I no longer do.

254
00:13:48,545 --> 00:13:52,071
Plus, hearing he's a daddy from some
random doctor might not go over real well.

255
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:54,073
- So the baby's father doesn't know.
- No,

256
00:13:54,826 --> 00:13:56,193
and he's never going to.

257
00:13:58,175 --> 00:13:59,531
Grey, can I speak with you ?

258
00:13:59,615 --> 00:14:01,123
Um, I'm setting up a chest tube.

259
00:14:01,226 --> 00:14:03,212
- I need to talk to you when you're done.
- I'll come find you.

260
00:14:04,215 --> 00:14:05,980
You know, I can suture.
I've done it before.

261
00:14:05,977 --> 00:14:09,041
When you can do a z-plasty and
barely see the scar, give me a call.

262
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:11,321
Till then, dab and clean,

263
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:12,863
dab and clean.

264
00:14:12,966 --> 00:14:15,943
How's plastics, karev ?
Everything you've ever dreamed of ?

265
00:14:17,197 --> 00:14:19,693
Uh, we're not doing
a chest tube, dr. Grey.

266
00:14:19,986 --> 00:14:21,892
- What's going on ?
- Ms. Duco,

267
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,352
there's a shard of glass
going into your heart.

268
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:34,300
- Hey.
- Hey. Have you seen dr. Torres ?
- No.

269
00:14:34,515 --> 00:14:38,730
- Quite a morning, huh ? 14 injured, 2 dead.
- I know. There's a lot of blood...

270
00:14:38,775 --> 00:14:39,902
- yeah.
- And blood.

271
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,960
You know, there's a girl who literally
has a shard of glass in her chest.

272
00:14:44,065 --> 00:14:44,753
Come here.

273
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:48,051
Larry dickerson-- the guy that crashed
into the fish market.

274
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:52,143
it's a subdural hematoma along with air
in his mediastinum. Now look at this,
look at his spine right here.

275
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,300
- Spinal stenosis.
- Yep.

276
00:14:54,495 --> 00:14:57,761
Narring of the spine,
most often a result of aging.

277
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,632
Causes numbness in the legs and feet.

278
00:14:59,745 --> 00:15:02,823
His case is so far advanced,
I doubt he could even feel his feet,

279
00:15:03,297 --> 00:15:05,893
- which means--
- oh, he shouldn't have been driving.

280
00:15:06,177 --> 00:15:07,242
You paged me ?

281
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,082
Patient has air in the mediastinum.

282
00:15:09,186 --> 00:15:10,483
Wanted you to take a look.

283
00:15:10,566 --> 00:15:12,580
- Oh, this guy shouldn't have been driving.
- I know.

284
00:15:12,988 --> 00:15:14,623
It looks like he has a tracheal injury.

285
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:16,260
You going into the O.R.
For the subdural ?

286
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,731
Yeah, as soon as one becomes available.

287
00:15:19,577 --> 00:15:20,810
What's going on with Cristina ?

288
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:23,203
What do you mean ?

289
00:15:23,246 --> 00:15:26,523
Well, first she kicks me out of bed
at 5 :00 this morning so she can have
girl talk with meredith,

290
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:31,951
and now I can't find her.
She was supposed to be my intern.
I had to get my own C.T. What's goin' on ?

291
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:38,700
Nothing. Cristina's fine.
She's just working really hard.

292
00:15:39,536 --> 00:15:42,360
I'm sure I don't have any idea.

293
00:15:45,106 --> 00:15:48,771
don't mention Cristina to Burke, okay ?
It's just not a good idea.

294
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:50,392
Yeah ? What did you talk
about this morning ?

295
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:51,883
Bank robberies...

296
00:15:52,746 --> 00:15:54,551
which isn't really the point,

297
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:57,390
okay ?
She was jogging, and well...

298
00:15:57,657 --> 00:16:00,171
just cut her some slack today, okay ?

299
00:16:00,328 --> 00:16:02,991
- Not that I should interfere--
- but you're going to anyway.

300
00:16:04,858 --> 00:16:07,391
I'm just gonna ask once, very nicely.

301
00:16:08,406 --> 00:16:09,842
Please.

302
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:14,830
- Please.
- You know what says "thank you"
  like nothing else ?

303
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:19,300
I'm leaving now.

304
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:37,132
hey, uh, Derek's looking for you.
He said you left a patient in the C.T.--

305
00:16:37,156 --> 00:16:38,722
- Shh, shh, shh. I'm trying to hear.
- What's going on ?

306
00:16:47,045 --> 00:16:49,511
- Dr. Yang.
- Yes, sir.

307
00:16:49,865 --> 00:16:52,941
When you see dr. Burke, tell him
I need to speak with him.

308
00:16:53,065 --> 00:16:54,163
Of course, sir.

309
00:16:54,617 --> 00:16:58,681
Uh, is that, uh, dr. Hahn from
presbyterian talking to George's dad ?

310
00:16:59,408 --> 00:17:03,632
Mr. O'malley has elected to have
dr. Hahn perform his valve replacement.

311
00:17:03,928 --> 00:17:07,652
- Um, but what about dr. Burke ?
- Dr. Burke's been replaced.

312
00:17:16,058 --> 00:17:18,173
***************** Dr. Hahn ?

313
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:19,980
I'm no longer on his father's surgery.

314
00:17:20,068 --> 00:17:21,802
That's a good thing if it means
you stop obsessing.

315
00:17:21,826 --> 00:17:23,500
George didn't just replace you.

316
00:17:23,745 --> 00:17:24,463
He told the chief.

317
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:25,792
The chief knows.

318
00:17:26,057 --> 00:17:28,593
I mean, for all we know, Erica Hahn's
being considered the new head of cardio.

319
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:34,543
And the chief asked me to tell you that he
has something important to talk to you about.

320
00:17:34,907 --> 00:17:36,713
Oh, okay.

321
00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:38,470
So we need to align our stories.

322
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:40,050
This is why I feel like
I'm covering for you.

323
00:17:40,347 --> 00:17:41,930
I don't line up stories.
That's not me.

324
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:43,490
Oh, I'm sorry. You think it's me ?

325
00:17:43,536 --> 00:17:45,171
- That's not fair.
- You know, it's done.

326
00:17:45,286 --> 00:17:48,283
The chief wants to talk to me,
so I will talk to him.

327
00:17:48,456 --> 00:17:51,100
I am not telling him a story, Cristina.

328
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:53,633
I'm gonna tell him the truth.

329
00:17:53,846 --> 00:17:56,043
Burke. Burke.

330
00:17:59,456 --> 00:18:01,031
Still getting a heartbeat there ?

331
00:18:01,137 --> 00:18:04,101
Happy to say. And it'll get stronger
once you've had your surgery.

332
00:18:05,397 --> 00:18:08,683
Do you mind me asking why you guys
switched from dr. Burke to dr. Hahn ?

333
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,231
No, we didn't. Georgie did.

334
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:12,651
- Did he say why ?
- Not really, no.

335
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:15,860
Did Georgie and dr. Burke
maybe have a falling out ?

336
00:18:15,925 --> 00:18:16,641
Not that I know of.

337
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,020
Then is there something going on
with George and dr. Hahn ?

338
00:18:19,085 --> 00:18:20,551
Ah, here we go again.

339
00:18:20,585 --> 00:18:22,840
No, there's nothing going on
with George and dr. Hahn.

340
00:18:22,928 --> 00:18:26,932
I already told her. Dr. Torres
is the one who loves George.

341
00:18:26,977 --> 00:18:29,061
Well, then why did dr. Torres
break up with him ?

342
00:18:29,748 --> 00:18:33,160
Why did dr. Torres break up with him,
I mean, between us ?

343
00:18:34,215 --> 00:18:36,920
Well... how much did George tell you ?

344
00:18:36,965 --> 00:18:38,121
Everything, I'm his mother.

345
00:18:38,168 --> 00:18:40,752
Okay, well, then you know
that callie is a little bit out there.

346
00:18:40,775 --> 00:18:43,270
I mean, I have seen more of that
girl's body than I have of my own.

347
00:18:43,286 --> 00:18:45,312
It's just a little bit too much
information for me.

348
00:18:45,378 --> 00:18:48,063
I mean, nobody needs to be
naked that often.

349
00:18:50,018 --> 00:18:53,170
He didn't tell you that ?

350
00:18:53,787 --> 00:18:56,670
Um... I don't know why they broke up.

351
00:18:56,746 --> 00:18:59,200
George seemed to really like her,
and he kind of needed her.

352
00:18:59,327 --> 00:19:01,231
I mean, you remember the whole
George and Meredith thing.

353
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:03,680
- Wait, George and Meredith ?
- I knew it.

354
00:19:04,036 --> 00:19:05,943
George didn't tell you that either.

355
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:08,713
First Meredith, then dr. Torres 
and now this dr. Hahn...

356
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:11,352
O'Malley men are studs.

357
00:19:11,425 --> 00:19:13,181
He isn't a stud, he's just very handsome.

358
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:16,281
Okay, people, focus. George
is not dating Erica Hahn.

359
00:19:16,308 --> 00:19:19,820
Then why would he want her to perform his
father's surgery instead of dr. Burke ?

360
00:19:19,906 --> 00:19:21,450
Is she better than dr. Burke ?

361
00:19:21,756 --> 00:19:24,002
She's good, really good.

362
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:25,922
Nobody's better than burke.

363
00:19:26,836 --> 00:19:28,781
Then  why can't I have dr. Burke ?

364
00:19:29,156 --> 00:19:32,913
- I don't know.
- Do me a favor...Could you find out ?

365
00:19:34,856 --> 00:19:37,492
- Hey, have you seen george ?
- No.

366
00:19:37,637 --> 00:19:40,253
- He is acting so weird.
- So is cristina.

367
00:19:40,317 --> 00:19:42,531
What is wrong with everyone today ?

368
00:19:42,956 --> 00:19:46,290
Hey, Callie. I was gonna come and find you.
What did you want toalk to me about ?

369
00:19:46,455 --> 00:19:46,980
Panties.

370
00:19:47,075 --> 00:19:48,742
Uh, Callie, what you up to ?

371
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:50,673
I'm gonna kick Meredith's ass right now.

372
00:19:50,707 --> 00:19:51,372
Get off me !

373
00:19:51,468 --> 00:19:54,541
kept your secrets, I was discreet,
I was a really good friend to you,
and I didn't have to be,

374
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:57,080
- and then you go and do this ?
- Do what ?!

375
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:59,462
Hey, Callie, use your words !
Use your words, Callie

376
00:19:59,485 --> 00:20:01,713
Panties, Meredith. I'm talkin'about
the mcfreakin'-cone-of-silence

377
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,673
pair of panties I pulled off
the bulletin board,

378
00:20:03,758 --> 00:20:06,321
not to mention the adulterous
mcsex I witnessed.

379
00:20:06,378 --> 00:20:07,113
You remember that ?

380
00:20:07,127 --> 00:20:10,332
Hey Hey, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but she's
very little, and you're hurting her.

381
00:20:10,428 --> 00:20:13,481
You told George. My night with mcsteamy
was not yours to share.

382
00:20:13,506 --> 00:20:16,011
That's what this is about,
your sex with mcsteamy ?

383
00:20:16,276 --> 00:20:18,661
- You told Izzie.
- No. No, no !
- Callie !

384
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:23,261
You told me you slept with someone.
You never said it was Sloan.

385
00:20:23,408 --> 00:20:25,923
George told me it was Sloan.

386
00:20:26,908 --> 00:20:28,123
George ?

387
00:20:28,335 --> 00:20:29,573
George told you ?

388
00:20:30,046 --> 00:20:31,521
Who told george ?

389
00:20:32,218 --> 00:20:35,160
- Maybe perhaps the guy you slept with ?
- Um...

390
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,572
George thinks I betrayed him,
and I didn't.

391
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:47,260
- I didn't. We were broken up.
- Well, go tell george.

392
00:20:52,638 --> 00:20:57,172
- Dude, she went all cage fighter on you.
- I know.

393
00:20:58,837 --> 00:21:00,232
How's my dad doing ?

394
00:21:00,578 --> 00:21:04,701
George, your ex is hard-core--
passionate, but hard-core.

395
00:21:04,787 --> 00:21:06,912
Yeah, I don't--
how is he doing ?

396
00:21:07,297 --> 00:21:08,170
He's fine, George.

397
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:11,250
And my mom, is she driving you crazy ?
Has she offered to iron your scrubs ?

398
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:17,152
She does that. She offers to iron
things, weird things.

399
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:20,861
- They're fine. They're just, um...
- what ?

400
00:21:20,987 --> 00:21:24,610
Confused. You know, suddenly a stranger
is operating on your dad's heart,

401
00:21:24,687 --> 00:21:28,152
and they both want to know why,
and I have no idea what to tell them, so...

402
00:21:28,728 --> 00:21:32,990
Cristina, tell Izzie why dr. Hahn is
doing my dad's surgery instead of burke.

403
00:21:38,486 --> 00:21:39,291
Go on.

404
00:21:41,115 --> 00:21:45,541
Look... dr. Hahn is an incredible
surgeon. Your father is in great hands.

405
00:21:45,618 --> 00:21:47,152
- Nothing else matters.
- You're wrong.

406
00:21:47,228 --> 00:21:50,900
There's a lot of people with fathers
in this hospital, and it does matter
to them who their doctor is.

407
00:21:56,428 --> 00:22:01,510
George, I... I-I know this is scary.
I understand that.

408
00:22:01,936 --> 00:22:07,641
But burke... I didn't come back until
I was ready. Preston burke is ready.

409
00:22:08,058 --> 00:22:09,220
Look, I...

410
00:22:09,535 --> 00:22:14,411
I just can't talk to you about this. This
is none of your business, and just please,

411
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:15,751
please stay out of this.

412
00:22:15,908 --> 00:22:18,840
- What do I do about your parents ?
- You don't do anything about my parents.

413
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:21,701
Your job is to watch, remember ?

414
00:22:22,477 --> 00:22:26,561
I was just... sorry.

415
00:22:32,255 --> 00:22:35,200
You might consider leaving that alone
until she goes into the O.R.

416
00:22:35,306 --> 00:22:37,450
Yeah, about that--
when's that gonna happen ?

417
00:22:37,595 --> 00:22:40,123
There's a large shard of glass
in my heart, you know ?

418
00:22:40,157 --> 00:22:43,000
You'd be suprised how long people can
live with stuff inside their bodies--

419
00:22:43,086 --> 00:22:45,040
glass, shrapnel, bullets.

420
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:48,131
I saw a guy once with half
a chair leg in his chest.

421
00:22:48,185 --> 00:22:50,653
That was one hell of a splinter.

422
00:22:50,748 --> 00:22:51,862
Can we focus here ?

423
00:22:52,498 --> 00:22:54,111
Well...

424
00:22:54,398 --> 00:22:57,063
it looks like we'll, uh, have the O.R.
In a few hours.

425
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,961
So if I get hit by a car,

426
00:22:59,316 --> 00:23:00,763
thrown through a window,

427
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:04,153
have a big shard of glass in my chest
and my baby survives,

428
00:23:04,538 --> 00:23:07,182
that's pretty much a sign
I should have this baby, right,

429
00:23:07,466 --> 00:23:08,591
even without a father ?

430
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:11,392
- Everyone has a father.
- Not if she doesn't tell him.

431
00:23:12,486 --> 00:23:14,562
You think I should tell him.

432
00:23:14,777 --> 00:23:16,451
Everyone says I'm wrong.

433
00:23:16,607 --> 00:23:20,320
He's scum, and now I'm the bad guy 'cause
I don't want him in my kid's life, right ?

434
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:22,522
- That's what you're thinking ?
- Janelle...

435
00:23:23,677 --> 00:23:25,430
my thing is, what about the kid ?

436
00:23:25,657 --> 00:23:27,992
I mean, what happens when he's 6 or 7
and he wants to meet his dad ?

437
00:23:28,055 --> 00:23:29,943
Karev, this is none of
your business, okay ?

438
00:23:30,028 --> 00:23:31,040
She asked, okay ?

439
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:32,282
He cheated on me.

440
00:23:32,546 --> 00:23:35,142
Makes him an ass. Doesn't
mean you have to be one.

441
00:23:37,235 --> 00:23:38,680
ms. Duco ?

442
00:23:40,566 --> 00:23:43,060
B.P.'S 80 over 60.

443
00:23:44,065 --> 00:23:45,500
J.V.D. And muffled heart sounds.

444
00:23:45,555 --> 00:23:47,740
She's officially unstable.
The O.R. Can't wait.

445
00:23:47,817 --> 00:23:51,043
Alex, find burke and bolus a liter
of saline, hang a unit of blood.

446
00:23:51,105 --> 00:23:53,813
We've got to get her ready
for transport, people, now !

447
00:23:54,095 --> 00:23:57,261
- I'm sorry. Spinal what ?
- stenosis.

448
00:23:57,515 --> 00:23:59,363
- And he got this in the accident ?

449
00:23:59,465 --> 00:24:01,121
I think it may have caused
the accident.

450
00:24:01,268 --> 00:24:03,162
Spinal stenosis is common
in older people.

451
00:24:03,227 --> 00:24:04,252
No, no.

452
00:24:04,327 --> 00:24:06,821
Larry didn't have anything wrong with
him before the accident.

453
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:09,742
So there were no symptoms
that either of you noticed ?

454
00:24:09,795 --> 00:24:11,323
No, Larry was fine.

455
00:24:12,398 --> 00:24:15,252
We're old, but we've both
been in good health.

456
00:24:15,386 --> 00:24:16,292
Larry was fine.

457
00:24:16,387 --> 00:24:17,923
We're gonna need to operate
on your husband.

458
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:20,602
He has a subdural hematoma,
which is bleeding in the brain.

459
00:24:20,787 --> 00:24:25,532
And we need to bring in a cardiothoracic
surgeon to repair the hole in his
trachea, which is his windpipe.

460
00:24:25,885 --> 00:24:29,050
That--that--so that means
that you need to operate on his...

461
00:24:30,228 --> 00:24:32,773
- chest and his head ?
- Yes.

462
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:38,661
We just wanted to go to the market.

463
00:25:04,017 --> 00:25:06,010
It'll be okay, whatever happens.

464
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:08,021
- Cristina--
- No, he can't punish you.

465
00:25:08,158 --> 00:25:10,162
Every surgery we've done
has been textbook,

466
00:25:10,238 --> 00:25:13,320
- and we haven't lost a single patient.
We're flawless, and he can't--
- Cristina.

467
00:25:14,017 --> 00:25:15,413
You were right.

468
00:25:16,235 --> 00:25:22,542
The chief does want dr. Hahn to replace
me as head of cardiothoracic surgery.

469
00:25:24,327 --> 00:25:27,593
Richard's planning to retire.

470
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:34,800
And he's recommending that the board
name me... the next chief of surgery.

471
00:25:49,697 --> 00:25:52,712
This is good. It's good, right ?
It means George didn't say anything.

472
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:55,803
- I'm going to be chief.
- And you didn't tell him anything
about your tremor, right ?

473
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:57,660
I'm going to be chief...

474
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:02,083
of surgery at Seattle grace hospital.

475
00:26:02,517 --> 00:26:07,130
- Why do you sound like that ?
- Because I'm going to be chief of surgery
at Seattle grace hospital.

476
00:26:07,965 --> 00:26:12,310
This is what you've worked for.
This is what you wanted.

477
00:26:12,657 --> 00:26:14,282
And I can work harder. I--

478
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:17,343
I can learn more procedures,
I will do whatever you need.

479
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:18,763
- What ?
- Right now

480
00:26:19,075 --> 00:26:22,093
nobody knows. I-I mean, yes, okay,

481
00:26:22,245 --> 00:26:25,581
the fact that George hasn't told the chief
yet doesn't mean that he won't,
but we can deal with that.

482
00:26:25,628 --> 00:26:27,943
I mean, I'll--I'll talk to him,
or you talk to him.

483
00:26:28,285 --> 00:26:31,330
And once you're chief, it won't matter.
I mean, you'll be chief. Okay, this is--

484
00:26:31,607 --> 00:26:34,873
- this is good. Nobody will ever know.
- I'll know.

485
00:26:35,465 --> 00:26:37,782
I can't be chief, not now,
not like this.

486
00:26:37,995 --> 00:26:40,110
Do you know how long I wanted this ?

487
00:26:40,488 --> 00:26:44,053
My entire career.
And when I finally get it...

488
00:26:45,468 --> 00:26:49,162
there's blood on it. I had a tremor,
and I didn't say anything about it.

489
00:26:49,346 --> 00:26:52,591
It's unimaginable.
It's unethical...

490
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:54,550
dishonorable.

491
00:26:54,636 --> 00:26:57,030
- I've crossed a line.
- We crossed the line

492
00:26:57,415 --> 00:27:01,180
- Together. I crossed the line with you.
- You dragged me across the line.

493
00:27:02,527 --> 00:27:04,720
You made us a team,
you told shepherd I was fine,

494
00:27:04,738 --> 00:27:06,082
you said, "nobody has to know."

495
00:27:06,128 --> 00:27:07,341
I was out there on my own.

496
00:27:07,398 --> 00:27:08,460
You made us a team.

497
00:27:08,505 --> 00:27:10,220
I did what you needed me to do.

498
00:27:10,275 --> 00:27:13,040
You were standing there looking at me,
telling me your whole life was your hands,

499
00:27:13,137 --> 00:27:15,063
if you couldn't operate,
if you couldn't be Preston Burke--

500
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:16,992
- That was your concern, not mine.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

501
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:18,252
No, you put that on me.

502
00:27:23,288 --> 00:27:24,901
When you got shot, I walked away,

503
00:27:26,258 --> 00:27:28,130
and you cannot let that go, can you ?

504
00:27:30,598 --> 00:27:32,870
Well, I'm sticking now.
Okay ? I'm sticking.

505
00:27:33,435 --> 00:27:34,983
You know how tired I am ?

506
00:27:35,548 --> 00:27:37,592
Do you know how scared I am
every time we go into surgery ?

507
00:27:37,627 --> 00:27:38,853
But I do it, for you.

508
00:27:38,906 --> 00:27:41,350
Do you know how scared I am
when we go into surgery ?

509
00:27:41,705 --> 00:27:43,550
I don't have to just worry
about my career now.

510
00:27:43,627 --> 00:27:45,352
I have to put yours on my back, too.

511
00:27:45,506 --> 00:27:47,662
- We are a team.
- Oh, there is no team.

512
00:27:47,797 --> 00:27:49,191
There is no team.

513
00:27:49,326 --> 00:27:53,430
There is only me, once again, making
allowances for your emotional shortcomings.

514
00:27:59,956 --> 00:28:03,271
we shouldn't say anymore.

515
00:28:08,096 --> 00:28:08,710
No...

516
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,790
we shouldn't.

517
00:28:34,885 --> 00:28:36,233
Oh, look who's here.

518
00:28:36,395 --> 00:28:39,271
Oh, look how wrinkled he is.
Thank god I brought the travel iron.

519
00:28:39,288 --> 00:28:41,892
Mom. M, what's going on ?
They paged me to your room. Are you okay ?

520
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:42,753
Fine.

521
00:28:43,865 --> 00:28:45,460
It's just that...

522
00:28:47,198 --> 00:28:49,482
- What ?
- Want me to ?

523
00:28:49,736 --> 00:28:51,231
No, I'll do it.

524
00:28:51,776 --> 00:28:53,130
Here's the thing,

525
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,893
we appreciate everything
you've done for us.

526
00:28:55,918 --> 00:28:58,560
All the strings you pulled
with dr. Burke and dr. Hahn--

527
00:28:58,585 --> 00:29:00,661
the last thing we want to do
is cause trouble

528
00:29:00,768 --> 00:29:02,871
'cause we heard how much stress
you been under.

529
00:29:03,027 --> 00:29:05,660
First with you and Meredith,
then with you and Callie--

530
00:29:05,705 --> 00:29:06,823
- Izzie !
- I thought they knew.

531
00:29:06,885 --> 00:29:11,621
And we hope you won't be mad, but we
rescheduled the surgery for tomorrow

532
00:29:12,015 --> 00:29:14,373
- because--
- we're sticking with dr. Burke.

533
00:29:16,565 --> 00:29:18,160
What did you say to them ?

534
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:22,510
- We asked her--
- I asked you to stay outta this.

535
00:29:22,676 --> 00:29:25,033
- I just told them what I thought, that doc--
- get out.

536
00:29:25,536 --> 00:29:26,431
W-what ?

537
00:29:26,735 --> 00:29:27,822
Georgie...

538
00:29:28,055 --> 00:29:30,450
- you don't talk like that to anyone.
- Dad...

539
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:37,441
did dr. Stevens tell you that she's on probation
because the last time she was allowed to
interact with patients, someone died ?

540
00:29:47,205 --> 00:29:50,782
It was really nice to see both of you.

541
00:30:01,286 --> 00:30:03,812
you know the guy
who caused the accident ?

542
00:30:03,946 --> 00:30:06,461
An O.R. Just cleared up.
You available to scrub in with me ?

543
00:30:09,066 --> 00:30:13,843
- Shepherd...
- Burke.

544
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:17,121
What's going on ?

545
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:22,222
dr. Burke, we got a pregnant woman in the pit
with a traumatic cardiac tamponade

546
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,080
from a piece of glass
piercing her heart.

547
00:30:24,326 --> 00:30:26,841
- Addison asked for you.
- Well, you can't do two surgeries at once.

548
00:30:27,918 --> 00:30:30,281
No, I can't.

549
00:30:31,566 --> 00:30:33,682
Well, she's bleeding like crazy.
What do you want to do ?

550
00:30:34,106 --> 00:30:37,333
Burke, my guy can't wait much longer.

551
00:30:40,008 --> 00:30:41,592
Well, dr. Hahn is here.

552
00:30:41,766 --> 00:30:45,402
Invite her to scrub in with you, dr. Shepherd.
I'll take the glass piercing the heart.

553
00:30:45,526 --> 00:30:46,442
Okay.

554
00:30:48,975 --> 00:30:50,862
- Uh, Karev.
- Yes, sir.

555
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:54,032
Make sure that dr. Yang
scrubs in with me.

556
00:30:55,226 --> 00:30:57,810
Everybody gets a surgery but me.

557
00:31:18,155 --> 00:31:19,961
We were broken up,
as in not together.

558
00:31:20,055 --> 00:31:24,230
- I can't do this now.
- I-I slept with mark to get over you,
and guess what, it didn't work.

559
00:31:24,595 --> 00:31:25,660
It was a mistake,

560
00:31:25,788 --> 00:31:29,292
but I did not betray you, George.
I wouldn't-- I would never do that.

561
00:31:29,308 --> 00:31:30,742
I can't do this now.

562
00:31:39,108 --> 00:31:42,063
Oh, where are you taking her ?

563
00:31:42,105 --> 00:31:44,272
- She's having an operation.
- Oh, no.

564
00:31:44,455 --> 00:31:46,912
What--what-- what's wrong with her ?

565
00:31:46,885 --> 00:31:48,823
She has some bleeding in her chest,

566
00:31:48,848 --> 00:31:49,691
and they need to operate.

567
00:31:51,475 --> 00:31:55,652
I'm sorry, janelle.
I'm so, so sorry.

568
00:31:56,357 --> 00:31:58,350
It's okay, mrs. D.

569
00:31:58,415 --> 00:32:00,741
- I'm gonna be okay.
- All right.

570
00:32:01,117 --> 00:32:06,461
Mrs. Dickerson, you should go back to your
husband's room and wait there, okay ?

571
00:32:07,438 --> 00:32:09,230
He's having surgery, too.

572
00:32:10,277 --> 00:32:13,013
Everyone is having surgery.

573
00:32:15,877 --> 00:32:19,142
Uh, go on and take her up.
The surgical team is waiting.

574
00:32:19,195 --> 00:32:19,522
Ma'am.

575
00:32:20,916 --> 00:32:21,762
What did I do ?

576
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:24,580
- How could I have done this ?
- Done what ? Done what ?

577
00:32:24,896 --> 00:32:25,672
I knew

578
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:28,292
that he had trouble, my husband,
with his feet.

579
00:32:29,756 --> 00:32:32,142
My daughter came to town,
she took away his keys.

580
00:32:32,185 --> 00:32:33,463
She took away his keys.

581
00:32:36,036 --> 00:32:37,540
You gave'em back to him.

582
00:32:38,486 --> 00:32:40,571
If I'd sided with my daughter,

583
00:32:40,678 --> 00:32:44,490
oh, larry would have felt so betrayed.
He loves to drive.

584
00:32:45,348 --> 00:32:47,702
He--he--he didn't mean to hurt anyone.

585
00:32:48,028 --> 00:32:48,951
Oh, god.

586
00:32:49,948 --> 00:32:51,440
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

587
00:32:51,998 --> 00:32:53,213
I'm so sorry.

588
00:32:54,478 --> 00:32:56,893
Um... listen, come with me.

589
00:32:57,095 --> 00:33:01,211
- What ?
- I know that you didn't mean to hurt anyone...

590
00:33:04,106 --> 00:33:05,772
but we need to tell the police.

591
00:33:07,405 --> 00:33:08,821
Just trust me, okay ?

592
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:45,681
it entered the right ventricle

593
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,742
and went right through the septum.

594
00:33:48,018 --> 00:33:49,801
I'm going to need to place
a pericardial patch.

595
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:51,392
Shall I do a running whip stitch ?

596
00:33:51,518 --> 00:33:54,473
- No, I've got it.
- I can do a mcgoon.
I've been practicing.

597
00:33:54,858 --> 00:33:58,252
Dr. Yang, move to
the other side of the table.

598
00:33:59,335 --> 00:34:01,462
Dr. Burke, I apologize. I--

599
00:34:01,827 --> 00:34:04,631
move... to the other side
of the table. Thank you.

600
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,980
can I get some more lap pads ?

601
00:34:20,508 --> 00:34:22,030
How's it going down there, dr. Hahn ?

602
00:34:22,098 --> 00:34:23,341
Oh, just groovy.

603
00:34:23,608 --> 00:34:26,402
They're all gonna be so jealous
back at Seattle presbyterian.

604
00:34:26,527 --> 00:34:27,263
Why is that ?

605
00:34:27,386 --> 00:34:30,970
Scrubbing in with Derek Shepherd,
the genius who saved Preston Burke

606
00:34:31,026 --> 00:34:32,720
when he almost got his a shot off ?

607
00:34:32,976 --> 00:34:34,231
Major jealousy.

608
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:35,682
Did you hear that ?
I'm a genius.

609
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:36,941
Of course you are.

610
00:34:36,995 --> 00:34:38,491
- No, she was serious.
- Mm-hmm.

611
00:34:38,635 --> 00:34:41,403
Damn it. I'm seeing
a partial tear in his aorta.

612
00:34:41,757 --> 00:34:42,293
You okay ?

613
00:34:42,325 --> 00:34:44,741
I'm gonna have to enlarge
the incision to get to the aorta.

614
00:34:44,806 --> 00:34:47,303
We're gonna have to turn him
on his back and redress.

615
00:34:48,536 --> 00:34:49,770
his pressure's bottomed out.

616
00:34:49,835 --> 00:34:51,040
Can you get control down there ?

617
00:34:51,097 --> 00:34:54,381
I know, I know, he's crashing, and this
leration's getting bigger by the second.

618
00:34:54,436 --> 00:34:55,383
All right, you need help ?

619
00:34:55,417 --> 00:34:56,423
I need four hands,

620
00:34:56,475 --> 00:34:58,442
and I need everyone in here
to help me turn him.

621
00:34:58,675 --> 00:35:00,013
- Page thompson.
- He's out.

622
00:35:00,077 --> 00:35:01,073
Is burke available ?

623
00:35:01,126 --> 00:35:01,800
He's in O.R. Three.

624
00:35:01,877 --> 00:35:03,311
Run in there and see if
they can spare him a second.

625
00:35:03,555 --> 00:35:05,301
Okay, I need everyone to help
me turn him.

626
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:06,402
On your count derek.

627
00:35:06,255 --> 00:35:07,373
We've got about half an hour

628
00:35:07,267 --> 00:35:07,660
move it.

629
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:08,291
before this patient dies...

630
00:35:07,685 --> 00:35:08,680
Take it off. Let's go.

631
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:10,381
That is it.

632
00:35:11,207 --> 00:35:12,522
Start rewarming.

633
00:35:12,685 --> 00:35:14,043
Pledgeted 5-0 prolene.

634
00:35:14,976 --> 00:35:17,310
It's gonna take about ten minutes
before the body warms up,

635
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:19,413
then we'll take her off bypass.

636
00:35:19,788 --> 00:35:21,770
Nice work, dr. Burke.

637
00:35:22,227 --> 00:35:23,663
Thank you.

638
00:35:28,267 --> 00:35:29,342
Dr. Burke,

639
00:35:29,556 --> 00:35:32,990
dr. Hahn was repairing the trachea
and found an aortic transection.

640
00:35:33,108 --> 00:35:35,120
Patient's crashing.
She really needs your help.

641
00:35:38,798 --> 00:35:40,252
What are you doing ?

642
00:35:40,976 --> 00:35:44,190
The heart can't come off of bypass for
a while yet. I'll be right back.

643
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:45,590
Um, shall I come ?

644
00:35:45,858 --> 00:35:47,820
No, stay here.

645
00:35:51,418 --> 00:35:52,580
Mer. Mer.

646
00:35:52,837 --> 00:35:54,181
Is it bad ?
What does she need him to do ?

647
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:55,331
The guy's chest is a mess.

648
00:35:55,425 --> 00:35:59,441
She's juggling the tracheal and the aortic injuries,
and she just needs another pair of hands.

649
00:35:59,505 --> 00:36:01,053
He just repaired a hole in her heart.

650
00:36:01,086 --> 00:36:02,390
I'm sure he can handle it.

651
00:36:06,025 --> 00:36:06,853
Cristina.

652
00:36:07,216 --> 00:36:08,032
hey, hey, hey.

653
00:36:08,435 --> 00:36:10,900
What do you think you're doing ?
Get back in there.

654
00:36:13,227 --> 00:36:16,381
What, do you think Burke
can't operate without you ?

655
00:36:22,436 --> 00:36:23,763
Oh, my god,

656
00:36:23,966 --> 00:36:25,992
- Cristina.
- Shut up.

657
00:36:26,505 --> 00:36:28,761
He can't operate without you.

658
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:32,910
If you ever gave a crap about me
in any way you will shut your mouth

659
00:36:33,036 --> 00:36:34,821
and get back into that O.R.

660
00:36:57,606 --> 00:37:00,220
There's a beat.
It's beating.

661
00:37:00,627 --> 00:37:03,743
- She's ready to come off bypass, right ?
- She is.

662
00:37:04,277 --> 00:37:07,101
Dr. Burke asked me to tell you
he's gonna be longer than he thought.

663
00:37:07,145 --> 00:37:08,172
"Longer than he thought"?

664
00:37:08,347 --> 00:37:09,152
What else did he say ?

665
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:13,920
She could stroke out
if she stays on any longer.

666
00:37:14,418 --> 00:37:15,291
What did he say ?

667
00:37:15,355 --> 00:37:17,541
He said you shouldn't worry.
He'll be right back.

668
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:22,402
Well, let's unclamp
and see what we've got.

669
00:37:26,388 --> 00:37:28,802
Brain's not interesting
enough for you, dr. Grey ?

670
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:32,203
I've still got a lot of bleeding.
I'll place a partial occluding clamp.

671
00:37:32,387 --> 00:37:34,141
4-0 prolene.

672
00:37:40,777 --> 00:37:43,632
- There.
- Excellent, Burke. Thank you.

673
00:37:43,806 --> 00:37:46,253
It should hold once you get
a few more in there.

674
00:37:47,468 --> 00:37:51,471
Focus, dr. Grey.
Focus.

675
00:37:54,995 --> 00:37:57,201
everything okay, dr. Burke ?

676
00:37:57,497 --> 00:37:58,971
Everything's fine.

677
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:01,810
Dr. Grey ?

678
00:38:05,985 --> 00:38:09,010
It's been too long.
She needs to come off bypass.

679
00:38:09,136 --> 00:38:10,820
She should come off soon, dr. Yang.

680
00:38:10,937 --> 00:38:12,070
How do you want to proceed ?

681
00:38:12,168 --> 00:38:14,763
I'm not having this girl
die of a stroke after all this.

682
00:38:14,995 --> 00:38:18,180
Page someone, anyone who can
help take her off bypass.

683
00:38:21,086 --> 00:38:23,841
- What happened in there ?
- He's going to live.

684
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:28,182
Dr. Burke, you were gone too long.
She could stroke out any second from--

685
00:38:28,287 --> 00:38:31,371
Gather yourself, dr. Yang.
Let's take her off bypass.

686
00:38:33,637 --> 00:38:35,492
Good. Good rhythm.

687
00:38:35,657 --> 00:38:36,571
Temperature is up.

688
00:38:36,795 --> 00:38:38,560
Okay, let's take her off bypass

689
00:38:38,605 --> 00:38:39,392
*** off bypass.

690
00:38:41,818 --> 00:38:42,622
start protamine.

691
00:38:43,466 --> 00:38:44,650
Give her more volume.

692
00:38:46,376 --> 00:38:47,910
Arterial line is out.

693
00:38:52,198 --> 00:38:56,091
nice. Keep going.

694
00:38:56,507 --> 00:38:57,552
Come on.

695
00:38:58,387 --> 00:38:59,061
There it is.

696
00:38:59,126 --> 00:39:01,412
Heartbeat's still strong.
Nicely done, dr. Burke.

697
00:39:01,538 --> 00:39:03,641
Uh, so we just check everything
and close.

698
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:04,892
- We'll close--
- Wait.

699
00:39:10,145 --> 00:39:12,240
Ugh ! She blew a stitch.

700
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,343
She ould have a tear in her heart.

701
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:14,731
Give me he pledgeted 4-0 prolene.

702
00:39:14,815 --> 00:39:16,051
Put up two fresh units of blood.

703
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:17,782
- What can I do ? Burke ?
- Hold pressure.

704
00:39:17,886 --> 00:39:19,542
I need to repair the heart wall.

705
00:39:23,586 --> 00:39:24,682
Should I put on a clamp ?

706
00:39:24,748 --> 00:39:25,843
- One moment.
- We don't have a moment.

707
00:39:25,855 --> 00:39:26,350
Hold on !

708
00:39:29,216 --> 00:39:31,870
I need to put the cannulas back in
so we can empty out the heart again.

709
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:35,802
She needs to go back on bypass.
Reheparinize and give me the tubes.

710
00:39:39,106 --> 00:39:42,140
her atrium is extremely friable.

711
00:39:48,276 --> 00:39:49,321
It can't hold a stitch.

712
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:51,251
- What about a horizontal mattress ?
I can do it.
- Dr. Yang,

713
00:39:51,688 --> 00:39:53,371
I don't need you for this.

714
00:40:01,956 --> 00:40:07,500
this is a known complication
of the surgery. It happens.

715
00:40:08,556 --> 00:40:10,312
It happens.

716
00:40:14,837 --> 00:40:17,690
- Restart bypass.
- Restarting bypass

717
00:40:18,936 --> 00:40:20,932
I was paged. Can I help ?

718
00:40:26,018 --> 00:40:27,752
I'm repairing the heart wall.

719
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,781
I could use your help for a
second attempt to come off bypass.

720
00:40:31,868 --> 00:40:32,923
I'll scrub in.

721
00:40:44,616 --> 00:40:46,820
Load more 4-0 prolene

722
00:40:47,638 --> 00:40:49,841
and a new pericardial patch.

723
00:41:24,708 --> 00:41:25,610
come in.

724
00:41:29,768 --> 00:41:31,753
Chief, we need to talk.

725
00:41:32,426 --> 00:41:36,730
Yes, dr. Burke,
I think we do.

726
00:42:10,637 --> 00:42:13,273
You're lucky, you know ?

727
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:15,160
- Pardon ?
- To study under Burke.

728
00:42:15,258 --> 00:42:18,651
If your little intern brain can retain
any of what he teaches you,

729
00:42:18,738 --> 00:42:22,162
Maybe you'll become half the surgeon he is,
And that's pretty damn good.

730
00:42:24,296 --> 00:42:26,461
If you tell him i told you this...

731
00:42:27,377 --> 00:42:30,351
ah, he'll never believe you.

732
00:42:38,136 --> 00:42:40,090
- Karev.
- Dr. Montgomery,

733
00:42:40,287 --> 00:42:44,901
- How's she doing ?
- She made it through the surgery.
So did the baby, which is, uh...

734
00:42:45,477 --> 00:42:47,493
well, it's like i said,
the kid's a fighter.

735
00:42:47,637 --> 00:42:49,191
You think she'll call the guy, the dad ?

736
00:42:49,328 --> 00:42:52,430
No. It takes more than a, uh, well
meaning speech

737
00:42:52,466 --> 00:42:54,853
To get a girl to make a
commitment like that.

738
00:42:54,978 --> 00:42:55,463
Yeah.

739
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,110
I appreciated it, though, your take. Uh,

740
00:42:58,286 --> 00:42:59,722
it was surprising.

741
00:42:59,908 --> 00:43:00,773
"Surprising"?

742
00:43:00,888 --> 00:43:02,732
Well, for a mark sloan protégé.

743
00:43:02,778 --> 00:43:04,862
Lackey. I dabbed blood all day.

744
00:43:05,725 --> 00:43:08,120
You're a decent guy, Alex.

745
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:11,410
I'd hate to see sloan beat
that out of you.

746
00:43:19,255 --> 00:43:20,401
- Anyway...
- Yeah,

747
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:22,103
- Thanks.
- All right, then.
- Okay.

748
00:43:49,646 --> 00:43:53,190
I would've helped you if you'd told me.

749
00:43:59,085 --> 00:43:59,642
Burke ?

750
00:44:01,078 --> 00:44:05,722
I cannot.
It's... been a long day...

751
00:44:08,347 --> 00:44:10,290
and i just cannot.

752
00:44:12,995 --> 00:44:17,182
- I thought you were my friend.
- I thought you were my surgeon.

753
00:44:22,627 --> 00:44:26,471
In some ways, betrayal is inevitable.

754
00:44:27,085 --> 00:44:33,571
When our bodies betray us,
Surgery is often the key to recovery.

755
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:38,531
When we betray each other...

756
00:44:39,147 --> 00:44:45,631
when we betray each other,
The path to recovery is less clear.

757
00:45:18,447 --> 00:45:22,393
It was both our idea to rob the bank.

758
00:45:22,827 --> 00:45:25,252
- It was both of us.
- I know.

759
00:45:25,436 --> 00:45:28,322
I just--Oh, i couldn't do it anymore.
It wasn't--

760
00:45:28,385 --> 00:45:29,911
You did the right thing.

761
00:45:30,918 --> 00:45:32,070
Yeah ?

762
00:45:34,577 --> 00:45:40,052
Then how come i walked across the parking
lot And realized i can't go home ?

763
00:45:43,695 --> 00:45:46,023
But where am i supposed to go ?

764
00:46:03,168 --> 00:46:06,303
- Hey.
- Hey.

765
00:46:07,215 --> 00:46:12,482
- So dr. Hahn...
- Yeah.

766
00:46:14,315 --> 00:46:19,520
He's my dad... and
i'm scared

767
00:46:21,077 --> 00:46:24,072
you of all people know what it's like
To have someone you love in the hospital--

768
00:46:24,075 --> 00:46:28,050
No. You do not get to bring up denny
to me ever again. Do you understand ?

769
00:46:30,106 --> 00:46:31,990
I'm sorry.

770
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:38,350
Don't try to apologize, not now,
not yet.

771
00:46:40,395 --> 00:46:41,001
Okay.

772
00:46:48,608 --> 00:46:52,751
- Maybe tomorrow.
- Okay.

773
00:46:59,886 --> 00:47:03,462
You watched his hands all through
surgery.

774
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:05,912
You knew.

775
00:47:06,436 --> 00:47:08,701
I can't say anything.

776
00:47:09,187 --> 00:47:13,692
There are things cristina told me.
She's my friend. I can't say anything.

777
00:47:14,295 --> 00:47:18,831
No.
No, that is not how this works.

778
00:47:19,745 --> 00:47:25,062
How could you know what you know
Or suspect it and not even tell me ?

779
00:47:25,826 --> 00:47:29,110
You cleared him for surgery, Derek.

780
00:47:29,467 --> 00:47:31,701
How did you not know ?

781
00:47:31,996 --> 00:47:38,110
You can't be angry with me.
She's my best friend,
And right or wrong, she...

782
00:47:41,386 --> 00:47:42,232
What ?

783
00:47:44,576 --> 00:47:47,300
She was there when you weren't.

784
00:47:59,107 --> 00:48:03,693
We do whatever it takes
To rebuild the trust that was lost.

785
00:48:27,847 --> 00:48:30,110
And then there are some wounds,

786
00:48:30,218 --> 00:48:32,383
Some betrayals that are so deep,

787
00:48:32,637 --> 00:48:34,071
So profound...

788
00:48:36,008 --> 00:48:39,060
That there's no way to repair what was lost.

789
00:48:46,227 --> 00:48:48,752
And when that happens...

790
00:48:59,517 --> 00:49:02,683
There's nothing left to do but wait.
