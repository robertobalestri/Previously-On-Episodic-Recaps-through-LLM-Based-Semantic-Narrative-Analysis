1
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:04,569
<i>In the OR, time loses meaning.</i>

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:08,306
<i>In the midst of sutures
and saving lives,</i>

3
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:10,475
<i>the clock ceases to matter.</i>

4
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:13,378
<i>Fifteen minutes, 15 hours.</i>

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:19,234
<i>Inside the OR, the best
surgeons make time fly.</i>

6
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:23,371
<i>Outside the OR, however,</i>

7
00:00:23,474 --> 00:00:26,308
<i>time takes pleasure
in kicking our asses.</i>

8
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,543
<i>♪ Never knew the
best was yet to come ♪</i>

9
00:00:28,645 --> 00:00:32,614
<i>For even the strongest of
us, it seems to play tricks.</i>

10
00:00:32,716 --> 00:00:35,750
<i>Slowing down...</i>

11
00:00:35,853 --> 00:00:37,319
<i>hovering...</i>

12
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:39,554
<i>♪ Life began when
I saw your face ♪</i>

13
00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:42,757

14
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:45,944
<i>leaving us stuck in a moment,</i>

15
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:50,982
<i>unable to move in one
direction or the other.</i>

16
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:54,619
Izzie. Izzie. Come on.

17
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,939
OK. She's been in there all
night. We have to do something.

18
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,418
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19
00:00:59,442 --> 00:01:03,177
- Yeah.
- Why are you all looking at me?

20
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:05,380
This is familiar
territory for you.

21
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,460
There is nothing
familiar about this.

22
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:11,570
Unfamiliar. Denny died.
The man she loves died.

23
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,683
Yeah, but you're all
dark and twisty inside.

24
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:16,792
- Dark and twisty?
- The mother with
the Alzheimer's,

25
00:01:16,894 --> 00:01:18,459
the father you don't talk to.

26
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:20,929
Tequila thing. The
inappropriate men thing.

27
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:23,715
You are dark and twisty and
now Izzie is dark and twisty.

28
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:26,367
So I'm the president of
People With Crappy Lives?

29
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:28,603
Seriously, we have
to do something.

30
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:30,839
Someone has to go in there.

31
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,264
<i>The seven years you
spend as a surgical resident</i>

32
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:42,234
<i>will be the best and
worst of your life.</i>

33
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,887
<i>Look around you.</i>

34
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:48,857
<i>Say hello to your competition.</i>

35
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:55,097
- Hi. Izzie Stevens. Washington.
- Alex Karev. Iowa.

36
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:57,782
This is nice. They throw a
mixer for the new interns.

37
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:02,737
It's just an excuse to get us all
happy and drunk before they torture us.

38
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,725
- What program are you in?
- Surgery.

39
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:10,162
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

40
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:12,280
What?

41
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,433
I'd picked you for Gynie
or Peds or something.

42
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:18,070
You don't think I can be a
surgeon? I can be a surgeon.

43
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:20,038
- Surgery's hardcore.
- I'm hardcore.

44
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,574
You won't last the first year.

45
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:27,445
- Hey, Izzie...
- What?

46
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:33,118
Maybe you should...
change your clothes.

47
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,920
- Maybe something
more comfortable.
- Stop it.

48
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:38,840
- Izzie.
- Stop it, I mean it.

49
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:41,810
Stop talking.

50
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:45,346
There is nothing to talk
about, do you understand me?

51
00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:48,016
There is nothing to discuss.

52
00:02:53,891 --> 00:02:56,375
I'm so sorry.

53
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:02,497
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

54
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,357
- You're a surgeon?
- Yes.

55
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:15,026
Usually don't send surgeons.

56
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,330
What do we need to... How
do I do this? What do we...?

57
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:21,482
Just ID the body before I
take him to the funeral home.

58
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:24,519
- So I don't take the wrong guy.
- That happens?

59
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,255
You wouldn't believe
how many times.

60
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:41,152
That's him. That's
Denny Duquette.

61
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,388
Great. Load him up.

62
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,124
And... sign.

63
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:48,887
- When's the funeral?
- No funeral.

64
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,980
The family asked to have
the body sent to Memphis.

65
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,154
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

66
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:06,161
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:06,263 --> 00:04:09,264
I'm so sorry.

68
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,939
Why are we making sandwiches?

69
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,487
That's what you do when
someone dies. You cook.

70
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:23,045
I know what to do
when someone dies.

71
00:04:23,147 --> 00:04:25,963
I am a Jew. I know
food and death.

72
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:30,335
- It's shiva.
- Is it shiva
even if she's Catholic?

73
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,972
Well, shiva's what I know
how to do, so yeah, it's shiva.

74
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,925
If we're sitting shiva for
Denny, then we should order in.

75
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,544
Making sandwiches is
not the same as cooking.

76
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,546
Sandwiches are comfort food.

77
00:04:42,498 --> 00:04:43,749
What's wrong with you?

78
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:46,634
Everything is fine. It's
Izzie we're worried about.

79
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:49,604
Oh, what did you do?

80
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:52,836
Denny died, Burke got shot.

81
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,577
Let's just have some perspective,
and remember what I did

82
00:04:56,679 --> 00:05:00,465
- is a tiny, slightly small...
- Whatever. Spit it out.

83
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:06,070
I lost my panties last night.

84
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:28,693
- Back already?
- I never left.

85
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,863
I did a craniotomy on a
ruptured saccular aneurism.

86
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,715
I've been here all night, too.

87
00:05:33,817 --> 00:05:35,733
I wanted to see the
autopsy on Duquette.

88
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,587
Yeah. You seen Meredith?

89
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:42,423
Dr. Grey. Have
you seen Dr. Grey?

90
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:44,593
Why? What's going on with you?

91
00:05:44,695 --> 00:05:48,329
Can you get somebody to cover
my rounds so I can take care of stuff?

92
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,799
Are you free? Dr. Shepherd,
there's an incoming head trauma,

93
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:54,819
and the pit's overcrowded
with early flu season.

94
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:58,952
Giselle Toussant,
42-year-old woman.

95
00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:01,492
Unrestrained driver of
a car that hit a railing.

96
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:05,997
She was... We were coming
to the ER. We were both sick.

97
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,316
We couldn't shake
this flu thing, so...

98
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:10,735
- She was better,
so I let her drive.
- Sir?

99
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:13,471
- Omar?
- Giselle?

100
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:16,274
- Honey?
- Where are we?

101
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:20,177
- Are we... Are we dancing?
- We had an accident.

102
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,281
She's leaking spinal fluid.
Let's get an OR ready, OK?

103
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:27,068
- The dancing's so beautiful.
- You're beautiful.

104
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,723
He's burning up.

105
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,409
Get him a bed. Let's get
her to the OR right away.

106
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,914
- What's going on?
- Premature newborn

107
00:06:40,017 --> 00:06:42,934
found in a trash can. The
umbilical cord's still attached.

108
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:45,064
You didn't start an
IV? He's dehydrated.

109
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:48,206
- Couldn't find a vein.
- I need to get an IV access.

110
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:51,609
Get me an IO needle and I
need a neonatal intubation kit.

111
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,177
Olivia. Go, move. Now!

112
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,579
They pulled me from the floor.

113
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:57,349
I'm just down here
helping with the flu overflow.

114
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,388
Alex, how old is that baby?

115
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,073
Wait, wait. What are you doing?

116
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:09,160
Think I'm gonna leave this
sick, premature infant in the ER?

117
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,929
He has to be admitted.
Can't take him.

118
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,964
Just page Addison Shepherd.

119
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,341
- Karev?
- Premature newborn
with petechia.

120
00:07:23,426 --> 00:07:25,426
- What's his platelet count?
- 17,000.

121
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,248
17,000? Did you
transfuse platelets?

122
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:30,081
- Yes, but it didn't help.
- Where's the mother?

123
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,250
I don't know.

124
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:35,320
I'm not asking you where
the mother is for my health,

125
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,905
I expect you to use your
brain. Where's the mother?

126
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:42,561
I don't know. The baby was found
in a trash can at a high school.

127
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:44,595
They left him in a trash can.

128
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,632
He's got some inner
abdominal bleeding on CT.

129
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,900
You wanna run some more tests?

130
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:51,837
Dr. Shepherd?

131
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:52,998
I need a stat ultrasound

132
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:54,867
and for you to infuse
two grams of IVIG,

133
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,869
if there is no cranial bleeding.

134
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,421
Then find out
where the mother is.

135
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:01,112
I need to test for maternal
platelet antibodies.

136
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,064
Can't you do surgery
to fix the bleeding?

137
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:06,667
If I wanted to kill him, I
could do that. Damn it.

138
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,588
- Who does this?
- Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd?

139
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,774
There are some people
here, about the baby.

140
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,496
- Busy morning.
- Getting busier.

141
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,548
You have a new
appointment on the books.

142
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,661
I have back-to-back surgeries...

143
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:24,185
You'll want to
take this meeting.

144
00:08:24,287 --> 00:08:26,854
She made an appointment.

145
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,675
The clot's been evacuated.
Are we ready to close?

146
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:33,711
Just want to make sure
there's no bone fragments.

147
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:38,399
- How's Izzie?
- As well as can be expected.

148
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:42,370
Never gets easier, you
know, losing a patient.

149
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:45,590
It's a little less
shocking, I guess,

150
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,860
but it never gets any easier.

151
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,764
Izzie was in love with him.

152
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,517
Denny wasn't just a
patient. They were in love.

153
00:09:01,224 --> 00:09:04,242
You had sex with Derek in
an exam room at the prom?

154
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:05,944
- Yes.
- Last night?

155
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,446
- You and Shepherd did it.
- Yes.

156
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,766
You and McDreamy
did the nasty-nasty?

157
00:09:11,868 --> 00:09:13,312
- Cristina!
- Not judging,

158
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:15,136
just trying to wrap
my mind around it.

159
00:09:15,238 --> 00:09:16,838
You're with Finn and
he's with Addison.

160
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,357
- He's married to Addison.
- Yeah.

161
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:22,860
Well, what did Derek say?

162
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,141
He said, "Meredith,
what does this mean?"

163
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:29,451
OK. He has sex with you and
he's standing there all McGuilty,

164
00:09:29,553 --> 00:09:32,654
and all he has to say for himself
is, "What does this mean?"

165
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:36,624
- What does this mean?
- I don't know.

166
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:38,659
Well, are you gonna
go back to Finn?

167
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:42,363
Is Shepherd leaving his wife?

168
00:09:42,465 --> 00:09:45,834
- I just...
- - <i>Hold on with both hands!</i>

169
00:09:45,936 --> 00:09:47,151
Meredith!

170
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:52,340
- Mommy!
- Richard, you were
to tell Adele...

171
00:09:52,442 --> 00:09:55,260
- I can't do that.
- That's what we agreed.

172
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:57,662
- Richard!
- I can't.

173
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,263
<i>♪ On paper my future will lay ♪</i>

174
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,800
- Please. Please.
- Ellis, no.

175
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:03,335
Richard, you can't leave me!

176
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:06,571
<i>♪ I'll fold every
failure into a crane ♪</i>

177
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:10,091
Please. Richard!

178
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,160
Richard!

179
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:13,978
<i>♪ Trust is quicksand ♪</i>

180
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,580
You didn't need an
appointment. I'm your husband.

181
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,951
It seemed to be the best way
to get your undivided attention

182
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,303
- because here you are.
- Adele, listen...

183
00:10:22,406 --> 00:10:24,088
- Sit down. Sit down!
- Adele.

184
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,024
- We have an appointment.
- Chief...

185
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,845
Excuse... The IDC is here.
We had a couple come in.

186
00:10:30,947 --> 00:10:32,913
Derek finished a
craniotomy on the wife,

187
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:35,766
but her husband's
got severe flu.

188
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:38,019
Swollen lymph nodes, buboes.

189
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:40,304
Turns out they
came in contact with...

190
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:44,526
The plague? Look, I'm sorry,
Adele. I need to deal with this.

191
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:48,880
Is a straight-A student.

192
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,549
Mine gets a B, she's
birthing babies in toilets?

193
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,619
I'm Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd,
treating the newborn.

194
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,054
He has a blood condition.

195
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,672
I need to know whose
baby it is I'm dealing with.

196
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:02,943
Yeah. We'd all like to
know that. Sara, talk.

197
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:04,913
I don't know anything
about any baby.

198
00:11:05,015 --> 00:11:07,481
- None of us do.
- One of you must, otherwise,

199
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,561
you and your parents
wouldn't be here.

200
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,687
Our girls... The principal said
that they were the last people

201
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:14,939
in the bathroom before
that baby was found.

202
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,152
We thought before
the police show...

203
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,493
One of you knows.
And you better confess.

204
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,462
Don't want Lisa in this.

205
00:11:21,564 --> 00:11:25,400
Police'll be here soon. Can't
you just do some DNA test

206
00:11:25,502 --> 00:11:27,918
- so the rest of us can get out?
- DNA results take days.

207
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,955
I'm not concerned with getting
the rest of you out of here.

208
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,341
If this baby isn't
treated, he's going to die.

209
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,724
Now I can do vaginal
exams on each of the girls.

210
00:11:35,812 --> 00:11:39,330
My daughter is 14,
she's not sexually active.

211
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,893
I won't have you violating her.

212
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:43,751
You won't have it 'cause you
know it's yours. Tell you what.

213
00:11:43,854 --> 00:11:46,921
You have my consent to do what
it takes to prove Lisa's innocent.

214
00:11:47,023 --> 00:11:49,068
You are a sick
bastard, you know that?

215
00:11:49,092 --> 00:11:52,160
A child's life is
in jeopardy here.

216
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,062
And it's not your
consent that I need.

217
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:01,002
We didn't do anything wrong.

218
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:02,787
It doesn't mean it's our baby.

219
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,650
Do we look like girls
who get pregnant

220
00:12:04,674 --> 00:12:06,590
and throw their
kids in the trash?

221
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,431
Nice work today, O'Malley.
Did Meredith go home with Izzie?

222
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,534
Yeah, Cristina too.
I'm headed there now.

223
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:20,404
- Yeah, me too.
- Oh, great. It's just...

224
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,666
I don't know if Izzie's
up for a lot of people.

225
00:12:22,726 --> 00:12:23,941
I'm gonna go see Meredith.

226
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,893
- All right.
- OK.

227
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,476
- Dr. Shepherd?
- Yes.

228
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:28,774
- Dr. O'Malley.
- Yeah?

229
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:30,865
I'm with the IDC. Is
anyone else in this room?

230
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:33,262
- No.
- Perform the surgery
on Mrs. Toussant?

231
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,053
- Yes.
- She was in close contact

232
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:36,520
with a victim of the plague.

233
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,957
- She may have been exposed.
- So we may have been.

234
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,591
- Yeah.
- I can't do this.

235
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,093
We're waiting on the
diagnosis of Mr. Toussant.

236
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,930
This room's sealed until we
know the threat's contained

237
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:48,066
- and you're safe.
- You're not saying...

238
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,534
You cannot leave. You
two are quarantined.

239
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,540
IDC has everything
under control?

240
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:59,577
They work fast. Anyone that
was in contact is quarantined.

241
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,557
Shepherd and
O'Malley are not happy.

242
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:04,882
Everything's under control if
you need to get back to your wife.

243
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,452
Oh, no. I should check
in with the IDC rep.

244
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,553
Gonna have to stay
on top of my hospital.

245
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,223
Keep me posted.

246
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,225
Hello. Hello!

247
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:17,728
I need help. Somebody. Please.

248
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,613
I know you can hear me.

249
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:24,068
I see you standing in
your giant, white spacesuit.

250
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,347
- Sir?
- Yes!

251
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,755
No unauthorized
personnel beyond this point.

252
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:29,101
IDC regulations.

253
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:32,659
I know he's under quarantine,
but he's also a patient,

254
00:13:32,762 --> 00:13:35,162
and I will not ignore a patient.

255
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,701
Hello out there. Thank God.
Thank God you can hear me.

256
00:13:39,803 --> 00:13:42,753
- How is my wife?
- My name is Dr. Bailey. Miranda Bailey.

257
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,605
Your wife is out of surgery.

258
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:47,725
She's quarantined in
recovery, but she's fine.

259
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,226
You were asking for help?

260
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:50,906
Know how many
day's I've been here?

261
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,514
- It's only been a few hours.
- Really?

262
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:57,902
I'm losing... I'm
losing track of time.

263
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,671
OK, sir, you're sweating.

264
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,573
I need you to sit down.
Get back in the bed.

265
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:07,211
What about my wife, Giselle?
Can you find out about Giselle?

266
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,797
Like I said, sir, she came
out of surgery just fine,

267
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,116
but I can check
on her status again.

268
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,335
You just stay calm
until I get back.

269
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,955
No! No, wait, wait.
Don't go. Please.

270
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,891
Just... Just stay a minute.

271
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:23,294
- Please.
- OK, um...

272
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,146
I'm staying.

273
00:14:25,248 --> 00:14:28,783
Omar. Call me Omar.

274
00:14:28,885 --> 00:14:34,121
OK, Omar. I'm... I'm right here.

275
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,412
I brought food.

276
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,197
George isn't here.

277
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,501
No, I know. He's in a
quarantine because of a thing.

278
00:14:46,603 --> 00:14:49,337
I was off duty and worried
about him and going crazy

279
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:51,872
and thought about
Izzie so I brought food.

280
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:55,576
- For the shiva.
- Are you gonna let me in?

281
00:14:56,513 --> 00:14:58,028
Yeah.

282
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:05,948
Relax. I'm not
gonna bring it up.

283
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,266
You and McDreamy and the sex.

284
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,707
- I'm not that person.
- Good.

285
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,809
- OK.
- Good.

286
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,528
Shiva? Is it shiva
if Izzie's Catholic?

287
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,264
Did you say quarantine?

288
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,285
This thing that you're
doing, it's not healthy.

289
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,955
You gotta take off that dress.

290
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,174
Get off the floor, take off
that dress, and take a shower.

291
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,779
Tell me about shiva.

292
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,550
It's something you do
when someone dies.

293
00:15:35,652 --> 00:15:39,253
- We did it for my grandmother.
- How does it work?

294
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:43,074
People bring over
food, family comes over.

295
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,978
It's supposed to help with
the grieving. It honors the dead.

296
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:52,450
- Sounds nice.
- Yeah. There's a lot of rules.

297
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:56,587
Seven days of no leather
shoes, no work, no sex.

298
00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:00,792
No sitting on things higher
than a foot. No shaving, no...

299
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:04,812
What?

300
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:10,468
No clean clothes.

301
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,673
Izzie, this doesn't
have to be shiva.

302
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,493
You know they
took his body away.

303
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,614
I'll never see him again.

304
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,303
How would you feel if you
never saw Burke again?

305
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,462
So we're sitting
shiva for Denny.

306
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,242
- You want to see him?
- See who?

307
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:54,261
- The baby. Your baby.
- It's not our baby.

308
00:16:54,363 --> 00:16:58,282
I've given you permission to
do this, now what's the hang-up?

309
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,646
The hang-up, sir, is
that if your daughter

310
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,237
doesn't want to do
it, I can't force her.

311
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:05,556
They're 14. They're
minors. We still have a say.

312
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:09,360
No, you don't. If someone doesn't
want to submit to a vaginal exam,

313
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,262
they don't have
to. It's the law.

314
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,282
All right, that' it. I'm
taking Lisa home.

315
00:17:14,384 --> 00:17:16,824
You do that, sir, and I
will have you arrested

316
00:17:16,853 --> 00:17:18,330
before you hit the parking lot.

317
00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:21,088
The law isn't the
only thing in play here.

318
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:24,408
If I do the exam
and the girl's a virgin,

319
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,405
there could be
bleeding, undue trauma,

320
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:28,174
not to mention emotional stress.

321
00:17:28,198 --> 00:17:29,478
If I had to guess
as to whose kid

322
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:31,065
doesn't have to
worry about that...

323
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:33,929
- What's that mean?
- It'd be nice if
Karen had a curfew.

324
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:36,019
At least she's not a shoplifter.

325
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:38,889
Shannon stole one lipstick
when she was nine. Get over it.

326
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,891
I know Lisa is a virgin.

327
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,893
Really? How do you know that?

328
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,196
Because she's only 14 years old!

329
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,648
Listen to me.

330
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,218
Derek, you can't do this.
We have to talk about this.

331
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,454
- No, we don't.
- Give me a chance to explain.

332
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:55,906
Wait. What are you
doing with my clothes?

333
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,443
It was one time! I know
that's what people say.

334
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:01,379
I know that's what gets said.
I don't know how it happened.

335
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,548
Don't know what I was
thinking. He was here.

336
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,532
You screw my best friend
and all you can say is,

337
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:08,235
- "He was here?" Get out.
- No.

338
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,804
- Get out.
- No. No, I'm not going.

339
00:18:10,906 --> 00:18:14,225
- Get out of my house now!
- We have to talk about this.

340
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:15,487
I'm holding my ground.

341
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,671
I'm holding my
ground. We don't quit!

342
00:18:17,713 --> 00:18:19,190
- We have to work...
- Get out.

343
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:22,149
What are you
doing? Derek, no, no!

344
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:30,357
Please. Derek.

345
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:36,113

Please.

348
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:47,340
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

349
00:18:47,443 --> 00:18:49,060
You have to give me a chance...

350
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:51,962
You have to give me a chance
to show you how sorry I am.

351
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:55,098
I'm sorry, OK?

352
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,835
- OK?
- OK.

353
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,780
I'm gonna go. You stay. I'll
get my clothes in the morning.

354
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:14,501
No, no, no. We can survive
this. Derek, we can survive this.

00:19:14,604 --> 00:19:18,122
We're... We're
Addison and Derek.

356
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,308
I can't look at you.

357
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,143

00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:06,787
- Yes.
- The Preston Burke.

367
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:09,790
Dr. Burke, I am such a huge fan.

368
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:13,627
Stentless valve replacement for
infectious endocarditis you performed.

369
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:16,897
And your use of
transmyocardio revascularization.

370

I'm Cristina Yang.

371
00:20:18,568 --> 00:20:22,569
If I could just get the chance
to study under you, I'd be...

00:20:22,672 --> 00:20:26,807

I mean, one of my

375
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:39,669
I could've gone to San
Diego, but Seattle's home, so...

376
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:44,508
- So you're new to Seattle?
- Oh, no, I kind of live here.

377
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:49,296
My mother lived here... lives
here, and I live in her house.

378
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:52,032
That's great 'cause
housing's a nightmare.

379
00:20:52,134 --> 00:20:57,487
I'm living with my parents
at home, which, well... sucks.

380
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,123
Oh, it's nice meeting you.

381
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:05,329
- We've been exposed to plague.
- They don't know it's plague.

382
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,030
So the men in the white suits,

383
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,333
what, making a
fashion statement?

384
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,834
No, it's a precaution.

385
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,903
When the blood work
comes back we'll be out.

386
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:16,357
What if the results come
back and she has the plague?

387
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:19,910
Well, then we get the
plague. Then we die in here?

388
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:24,281
With the crappy benches and the dirty
scrubs and the lockers full of old food?

389
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,200
There's food in the lockers?

390
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,771
Those are people's
personal... That's Alex's apple.

391
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,357
That's just rude.

392
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,159
We're dead men.
No time to be polite.

00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:40,881
Safe haven laws.

394
00:21:40,983 --> 00:21:43,817
All those girls would've had
to do was drop that baby off

395
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,086
at a fire station or a hospital.

396
00:21:46,188 --> 00:21:48,438
Now... it's a mess.

397
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,191
What are our options here?

398
00:21:50,293 --> 00:21:54,078
Blood-typing. We take a
sample from each of the girls.

399
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,013
The baby's blood
type is double O.

400
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:58,966
If the girls are A or B it
means the baby's not theirs.

401
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:01,302
Do it.

402
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:09,409
Everyone thinks I'll
know what to say to her.

403
00:22:09,511 --> 00:22:12,346
I don't know what to say to her.

404
00:22:12,448 --> 00:22:16,016
Dark and twisty Meredith.
I'm not dark and twisty.

405
00:22:16,118 --> 00:22:19,320
And if I am, it's
because I live my life

406
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:20,971
under a banner of avoidance.

407
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,407
I avoid. I'm an avoider.

408
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,409
Hello?

409
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,446
- Hey.
- Hey.

410
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,782
So can we...

411
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:34,618
Izzie. I gotta go
check on Izzie.

412
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,756
Don't take it personally.

413
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,643
- It's the doctor thing.
- What?

414
00:22:42,745 --> 00:22:45,546
Four years of high school,
four years of college,

415
00:22:45,648 --> 00:22:46,981
four years of med school.

416
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,083
By the time we graduate
we're in our late 20s

417
00:22:49,185 --> 00:22:52,987
and we've never done anything except
go to school and think about science.

418
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:56,790
Time stops. We're
socially retarded.

419
00:22:56,892 --> 00:22:58,525
I mean, look at me.

420
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,894
I'm in love with a guy who
won't say he loves me back,

421
00:23:00,996 --> 00:23:04,064
and here I am, in his kitchen, hoping
he comes home and notices me.

422
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:06,533
I'm a total freak.

423
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,986
I'm that girl in the back of
the class who eats her hair.

424
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:12,389
And Meredith...

425
00:23:13,242 --> 00:23:14,825
she's 17 years old.

426
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:18,011
We're all 17. This is high
school with scalpels, Finn.

427
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:25,553
- Oh.
- Yeah.

428
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:30,273
- How are we doing?
- We're not taking off the dress

429
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,209
- and we don't want to
discuss it.
- Stop with "we."

430
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:34,761
Do not "we" me.

431
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,617
Finn is downstairs.

432
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:42,169
- With Callie.
- So? What's Callie gonna do?

433
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:44,838
Just don't ask. Go.

434
00:23:46,742 --> 00:23:49,192
Fine.

435
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,520
I don't know what to say to you.

436
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:05,592
I don't know what
to say to me either.

437
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,765
When Dylan died...
when the bomb went off...

438
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:14,034
how did you feel?

439
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:17,187
It's not the same. We weren't...

440
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,569
He wasn't...

441
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:22,292
But when he died,
did you feel...?

442
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:25,612
What?

443
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,515
Like you were
moving in slow motion.

444
00:24:32,254 --> 00:24:34,449
He was there and then he wasn't.

445
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,057
Like I blinked and he was gone.

446
00:24:40,495 --> 00:24:44,765
I feel like I'm moving
in slow motion.

447
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:47,667
Like I'm moving in slow motion
and everything around me

448
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:51,872
is moving so fast and
I just wanna go back...

449
00:24:53,175 --> 00:24:55,275
to when things were normal.

450
00:24:55,377 --> 00:24:58,111
When I wasn't poor
Izzie laying on the floor

451
00:24:58,213 --> 00:25:00,514
in her prom dress with her...

452
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,885
Her dead fiancé.

453
00:25:07,189 --> 00:25:09,056
But I am.

454
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,358
So I can't.

455
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,427
And I'm...

456
00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:15,345
just stuck.

457
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:16,946
And there's all this pressure

458
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:18,815
'cause everyone's
hovering around me

459
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,785
waiting for me to do
something or say something

460
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,853
or flip out or yell
or cry some more.

461
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,855
And I'm happy to play my part.

462
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,741
I'm happy to say the lines

463
00:25:27,843 --> 00:25:29,627
and do whatever I'm
supposed to be doing

464
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:33,130
if it will make everyone
feel more comfortable.

465
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:36,233
But I don't... I don't
know how to do this.

466
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:39,269
I don't know how to
be this person. I don't...

467
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,840
I don't know who this person is.

468
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,909

469
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,280

470
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,784
How did we end up here?

471
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,970
Why am I alone?

472
00:25:57,072 --> 00:25:59,373

473
00:26:03,545 --> 00:26:06,146
You're not alone, Iz.

474

Trail mix and warm soda.

Who puts warm
soda in their locker?

476
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:17,157
As usual, Cristina's too lazy
to stock her locker with food.

477
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:19,392
Oh, now I hit he
mother lode here.

478
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:23,380
I got granola, cookies,
muffins. Who eats this much?

479
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:26,683
That's Izzie's locker. She ate
a lot. Said it kept her energy up.

480
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,719
- Eats.
- What?

481
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,869
Eats. You said "ate."

482
00:26:29,971 --> 00:26:31,855
Eats, present
tense. She didn't die.

483
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:36,776
Feels a little like she did.
She's never coming back here.

484
00:26:36,878 --> 00:26:41,397
You know... I don't think
she's ever gonna be the same.

Miranda, I'm feeling
better. A lot better.

535
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:42,262
I think the fever broke,
which is good, right?

536
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:46,082
- Yes, that's very good, Omar.
- How's Giselle?

537
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,535
Is she asking for me?

538
00:29:48,637 --> 00:29:53,339
Omar, for Giselle, being
exposed to the plague, it...

539
00:29:53,442 --> 00:29:56,259
It complicated things.

540
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:00,163
Complicated what things?

541
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:04,918
We did everything we could.

542
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:07,320
No.

543
00:30:08,823 --> 00:30:12,209
- I'm so sorry.
- No. No.

544
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:15,228
No, no, no!

545
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,346
Omar.

546
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:20,267
Come on, breathe.

547
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,957
Stop. No, no, stop.
He's hyperventilating.

548
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:29,976
- I have to go in there.
- You can't go in there!

549
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,978
Somebody has to go in!

550
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,535
- Omar!
- Oh, God! Oh, God!

551
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:40,448
- Can you hear me?
- I want my wife!

552
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,772
I need my wife. I need Giselle.

553
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:47,460
I have to save her! I have to
help her! Let me out of here!

554
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:49,746
Omar, look at me.

555
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:52,482
Omar, look at me!

556
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:56,286

- Omar, look at my hands!

559
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:05,128
Put your hands on my hands.

560
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,500
Come on. Good.

561
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:12,719
Good.

562
00:31:13,822 --> 00:31:16,439
OK. Look at me. Look at me!

563
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,493
Can you tell me my name?
Do you remember my name?

564
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:23,863
- Miranda.
- Miranda. That's right.

565
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,918
I want Giselle.

566
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,822
I have to save her. Please help.

567
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:35,442
Please let me out of here.

568
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:39,179
I wish I could help you.

569
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:41,932
Omar, I wish I could

570
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:44,584
turn back the clock
and make it yesterday.

571
00:31:44,687 --> 00:31:47,454
You don't know how
much I wish that, but...

572
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:51,691
I can't turn back time.

573
00:31:51,793 --> 00:31:55,762
Oh, I shouldn't have let
her drive. She was sick.

574
00:31:55,864 --> 00:31:58,965
- I should've taken over.
- I know.

575
00:32:01,303 --> 00:32:04,354
Come on. I know... I...

576
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:07,106
I should've taken
over too, but...

577
00:32:09,244 --> 00:32:11,077
We can't go back.

578
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,796
Look, even if I could
let you out of here,

579
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:16,850
you can't help Giselle now.

580
00:32:23,591 --> 00:32:25,408
Do you believe in God, Miranda?

581
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,478
I mean...

582
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,014
do you believe in the afterlife?

583
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,952
I have to believe.

584
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:40,323
With what I do,
Omar. I have to believe

585
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:43,459
that when our time comes

586
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:48,248
that we go to a place...

587
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,717
A beautiful place.

588
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:54,120
A... a better place.

589
00:32:55,256 --> 00:32:57,156
Omar.

590
00:33:01,463 --> 00:33:03,764
That woman died.

591
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:05,999
- She actually died.
- Doesn't mean we will.

592
00:33:06,101 --> 00:33:08,367
- Is it hot in here?
- No.

593
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:11,704
- Then why am I sweating?
- 'Cause you're pacing.

594
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:14,173
- My pulse is rapid.
- Because you're still pacing.

595
00:33:14,276 --> 00:33:16,142
- Feel me.
- I'm not gonna feel you.

596
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:18,345
- Seriously.
- Seriously, no.

597
00:33:18,447 --> 00:33:21,064
You know, you're an ass.

598
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:24,617
You've lived.
You've done things.

599
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:26,719
And you've got the hair.

600
00:33:26,821 --> 00:33:29,889
And the hot wife and the beautiful
ex-mistress who pines for you.

601
00:33:29,991 --> 00:33:33,126
- She's pining for me?
- My point is you've lived!

602
00:33:33,228 --> 00:33:36,145
If you die, who
cares? If I die...

603
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,282
What, this is it?

604
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:43,403
Callie told me she loved
me and I just sat there.

605
00:33:43,505 --> 00:33:45,738
I mean, I wasn't ready...

606
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,741
What, and now I'm gonna die?

607
00:33:48,843 --> 00:33:51,895
I'm not even going to get a
chance to say "I love you" back.

608
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,901
Do you? Do you love her?

609
00:33:58,003 --> 00:34:00,887
- She loves me.
- That wasn't the question.

610
00:34:00,989 --> 00:34:03,356
Maybe.

611
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,926
Eventually.

612
00:34:06,028 --> 00:34:08,028
I could.

613
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,930
One day, soonish.

614
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:14,751
"Soonish?" "I will
love you soonish?"

615
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,989
You ever tell Meredith?

616
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,658
You ever tell her
that you love her?

617
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,598
No.

618
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,585
I did.

619
00:34:32,687 --> 00:34:37,824
But... then with Callie...

620
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,962
you know... it's
different, but...

621
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:46,499
You should tell her.

622
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,086
Even if it's soonish.

623
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:53,089
You should tell her
before it's too late.

624
00:34:54,576 --> 00:34:56,676
You mean before
I die of the plague?

625
00:34:56,778 --> 00:34:59,529
Before somebody
else comes along.

626
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,899
I once set the bone
on the hind leg of a cow.

627
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:05,635
Come on. Now, that I believe.

628
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:09,605
He does boring animal stories,
and she's too stupid to care.

629
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,594
Oh, I'm gonna...

630
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:19,031
Oh, I'm gonna leave the room for a
period of time for no reason whatsoever.

631
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,522
I don't know what
happened last night.

632
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,241
- Between you and Derek.
- Finn.

633
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:30,076
And I don't wanna know.

634
00:35:30,178 --> 00:35:32,879
We never said that
we were exclusive.

635
00:35:34,416 --> 00:35:37,166
- But you have plans.
- Yeah.

636
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:40,370
Well, I didn't say I
wasn't pissed off.

637
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:43,873
I said we weren't exclusive.
That's all I wanted to say.

638
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:48,945
Oh, and... And this.

639
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:52,766
I know you think you're
scary and damaged.

640
00:35:52,868 --> 00:35:54,551
Dark and twisty.

641
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:57,687
It makes you feel like you
don't deserve good things,

642
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:02,742
but you do. And
Derek... he's bad for you.

643
00:36:02,844 --> 00:36:05,861
But me, I'm a good thing.

644
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:11,167
And if there's a race, if
there's a ring, my hat is in.

645
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,577
I made an appointment
for a reason.

646
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,412
I scheduled the time because

647
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:25,348
I had something
important to say and you

648
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,150
- made me wait.
- I have a situation.

649
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:31,854
I spent my life waiting. Waiting
for you to finish med school,

650
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:33,768
waiting for you to
come home at night,

651
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:36,359
waiting for you to
leave that... woman.

652
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:38,561
- I'm done waiting.
- Adele...

653
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:42,365
It's time for you to make a
choice. Me or this hospital.

654
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:45,151
It's time for you
to retire, Richard.

655
00:36:56,331 --> 00:36:59,583
It's obvious then. This baby
can't possibly be Shannon's.

656
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:02,452
Look at her. No one can stay
a size two and be pregnant.

657
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,587
- I've tried it.
- What're you saying?

658
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:07,569
- Sara's a little pudgy.
- At least she's not
sleeping around.

659
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,762
- I am short on time.
- Shannon didn't think

660
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:12,228
- about boys until Sara.
- You have some nerve.

661
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,547
Do I need to remind you
two who the teenagers are?

662
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,883
- She started it!
- Enough, OK?!

663
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:19,886
Both of you come
with me. Let's go.

664
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:22,038
- Let go of me!
- No. Move.

665
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:33,833
There he is.

666
00:37:33,935 --> 00:37:36,352
That's your son.

667
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:39,155
I want you both to look at him.

668
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,524
Because it's not true
that you did nothing wrong.

669
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:42,825
You both are wrong.

670
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,927
You're wrong for
covering this up,

671
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,445
you're wrong for lying about it,

672
00:37:46,547 --> 00:37:48,781
you're wrong for
letting this little baby,

673
00:37:48,883 --> 00:37:53,870
this sweet, innocent, beautiful
little boy suffer like this.

674
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:57,557
He's dying and it's your fault.

675
00:37:57,659 --> 00:38:01,260
It's both of your
faults, and the thing is,

676
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:03,863
the truth will come out.

677
00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:07,350
In time, it will come
out. It always does.

678
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,352
It just...

679
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,023
It just does.

680
00:38:14,742 --> 00:38:18,644
And when it does,
this baby will be dead.

00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,521
Shannon.

682
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:33,459
Don't tell my mom, OK?

683
00:38:38,332 --> 00:38:40,466
Thank you.

684
00:38:43,438 --> 00:38:45,655
Thank you for telling the truth.

685
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:57,182
You really don't feel anything?

686
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:01,721
I feel like I've been
here for a very long time.

687
00:39:03,058 --> 00:39:04,602
I feel like it
might be too late.

688
00:39:04,626 --> 00:39:06,192
Too late for what?

689
00:39:06,294 --> 00:39:09,229
Thank you for your patience
and cooperation, doctors.

690
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,108
You'll have to
go on antibiotics,

691
00:39:11,132 --> 00:39:13,413
but the threat has
been contained.

692
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,351
Good.

693
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:18,354
- What?
- You're free to go.

694
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,010
Poor little guy.

695
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,613
The minute he's OK we have
to turn him over to a mother

696
00:39:26,715 --> 00:39:30,066
who's going to juvie and
grandparents who are so clueless

697
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,635
they didn't even realize
their own kid was pregnant.

698
00:39:32,738 --> 00:39:36,622
Imagine the kind of
childhood he's gonna have.

699
00:39:38,026 --> 00:39:40,693
You can get over
a bad childhood.

700
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:44,430
I mean, you can have the worst
crap in the world happen to you.

701
00:39:44,532 --> 00:39:46,633
I mean, you can get over it.

702
00:39:46,735 --> 00:39:48,618
All you gotta do is survive.

703
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,289
Hello?

704
00:39:55,543 --> 00:39:57,476
Oh, my God.

705
00:39:57,578 --> 00:39:59,212
Oh, my God. I was so worried.

706
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:02,348
But... I'm fine.

707
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,818
I'm 100 percent plague-free.

708
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,937
- I was really, really worried.
- Yeah, I know. Me too.

709
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,273
George, I really,
really love you.

710
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:41,120
- Hi.
- Hi.

711
00:40:41,222 --> 00:40:44,340
I was gonna come
over this morning, but...

712
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:46,810
- I heard. The quarantine.
- Yeah.

713
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:04,744
So... what does this mean?

714
00:41:06,114 --> 00:41:08,281
It means you have a choice.

715
00:41:09,117 --> 00:41:11,851
You have a choice to make.

716
00:41:11,953 --> 00:41:13,369
And I don't wanna rush you

717
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,706
into making a decision
before you're ready.

718
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:20,809
This morning I was gonna
come over, and I was gonna say...

719
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:23,529
What I wanted to say was...

720
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,683
But now, all I
can say is that...

721
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,472
I'm in love with you.

722
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:37,277
I've been in love
with you forever.

723
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:42,298
I'm a little late. I know I'm a
little late in telling you that.
