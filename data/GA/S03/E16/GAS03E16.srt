1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,383
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,394 --> 00:00:04,061
We just received word of
a mass-casualty incident nearby.

3
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:06,014
You cannot tell Shepherd
until I've told Meredith.

4
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,602
Cristina and I are engaged.

5
00:00:08,644 --> 00:00:10,413
Immediate! Immediate!
I need help down here!

6
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,344
My buddy's trapped.

7
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:12,433
He's trapped under a car.

8
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,069
Dr. O'Malley and I made a deal.

9
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:16,811
He's gonna find my son
before I go into surgery.

10
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:17,900
I just have to bandage him up,

11
00:00:17,932 --> 00:00:19,368
we're gonna find someone
to take him to the hospital,

12
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:20,384
and then we're gonna find your mommy.

13
00:00:20,406 --> 00:00:22,063
- I gotta get outta here!
- No, sir, don't move!

14
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:30,682
<i>Like I said...</i>

15
00:00:32,056 --> 00:00:33,213
<i>disappearances</i>

16
00:00:34,177 --> 00:00:35,011
<i>happen...</i>

17
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:37,611
<i>Pains</i>

18
00:00:38,448 --> 00:00:39,223
<i>go phantom...</i>

19
00:00:41,578 --> 00:00:42,440
<i>blood</i>

20
00:00:43,617 --> 00:00:44,553
<i>stops running...</i>

21
00:00:46,476 --> 00:00:47,313
<i>and people...</i>

22
00:00:49,486 --> 00:00:50,601
<i>people fade away.</i>

23
00:01:21,996 --> 00:01:23,652
<i>There's more I have to say...</i>

24
00:01:27,657 --> 00:01:29,551
<i>So much more.</i>

25
00:01:35,017 --> 00:01:35,450
<i>But...</i>

26
00:01:40,857 --> 00:01:41,993
<i>I've disappeared.</i>

27
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:04,500
Did you check on Kramer in 2309?
Because his x-rays are done,

28
00:02:04,528 --> 00:02:05,451
and I don't know what to do.

29
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:08,803
Higgins in 2312 needs diet orders
before he can eat.

30
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:08,752
Done and done.

31
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:11,563
Um, I need you to monitor
Collins in 2323.

32
00:02:11,587 --> 00:02:13,813
Page me if his systolic drops below 90.

33
00:02:13,857 --> 00:02:16,541
I gave him a loading dose
of dig to lower his heart rate now.

34
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:17,841
Have either of you seen Dr. Grey?

35
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:20,611
Uh, I checked on her earlier, but
she's a little sedate today so...

36
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:21,970
Not Dr. Ellis Grey.

37
00:02:22,078 --> 00:02:23,080
Dr. Meredith Grey.

38
00:02:23,907 --> 00:02:25,001
- No.
- Not since this morning.

39
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:26,871
Fine.

40
00:02:27,246 --> 00:02:29,631
Um, if there's anything emergent,
page me in the pit.

41
00:02:31,326 --> 00:02:31,961
Georges...

42
00:02:33,038 --> 00:02:33,990
Did you find him?

43
00:02:34,347 --> 00:02:36,673
Is Chris okay? Is he awake? Is he...

44
00:02:39,795 --> 00:02:41,340
Answer Mrs. Heit, O'Malley.

45
00:02:49,898 --> 00:02:50,893
Chris is fine.

46
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:55,211
He's glad you're okay, and he'll be
waiting for you after surgery.

47
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:56,940
He's being very brave.

48
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,603
That's my Chris. That's my boy.

49
00:03:00,398 --> 00:03:02,941
Thank you, Dr. O'Malley, so much.

50
00:03:07,397 --> 00:03:08,280
Dr. O'Malley.

51
00:03:09,285 --> 00:03:10,450
Hold up a second.

52
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:16,181
So what happens when the happy mother
in there wakes up after surgery

53
00:03:16,235 --> 00:03:17,903
and her son isn't there to greet her?

54
00:03:18,327 --> 00:03:18,711
What then?

55
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:21,292
How you gonna explain that, O'Malley?

56
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:25,082
If she wakes up after surgery because
my lie helped to save her life,

57
00:03:25,148 --> 00:03:26,391
I'm okay with that, Dr. Bailey.

58
00:03:30,536 --> 00:03:32,592
Find that child.

59
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:33,323
Yes, ma'am.

60
00:03:39,718 --> 00:03:41,803
Her echo showed cardiac tamponade.

61
00:03:42,268 --> 00:03:45,973
Hmm. So our first priority is stabilize
the traumatic pericardial effusion.

62
00:03:46,047 --> 00:03:50,072
Well, keeping mom alive means keeping
baby alive. I'll monitor the surgery
while he operates.

63
00:03:50,087 --> 00:03:51,202
I'll notify the O.R.

64
00:04:01,155 --> 00:04:04,602
Chief, we got a mob scene in the clinic of
people looking for missing family members

65
00:04:04,648 --> 00:04:06,670
and nothing but a 2-hour-old
list of patients.

66
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,643
No one has any more
information than you do.

67
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:12,723
The police are asking us questions.
Search and Rescue can't track it.

68
00:04:13,456 --> 00:04:16,191
- We'll have to do it ourselves.
- Is there some kind of system that...

69
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:17,833
You're the system, Karev.

70
00:04:18,895 --> 00:04:19,601
Figure it out.

71
00:04:25,485 --> 00:04:26,463
How's she doing?

72
00:04:26,787 --> 00:04:29,193
Well, we won't know until
we get her up to the O.R.

73
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:31,213
Is she still a Jane Doe?

74
00:04:31,715 --> 00:04:31,973
Yeah.

75
00:04:32,698 --> 00:04:36,783
Oh, to be in that condition and have
no one who knows you even know...

76
00:04:37,647 --> 00:04:38,032
What?

77
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:40,070
I mean, she's all alone.

78
00:04:40,855 --> 00:04:41,923
It makes you think.

79
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,532
You know, if I went missing, would

80
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:46,901
anyone notice I was gone?

81
00:04:58,067 --> 00:04:58,941
Do something.

82
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:01,243
He's  still seizing.
There's nothing more I can do.

83
00:05:01,256 --> 00:05:03,291
You're supposed to put something in his
mouth so he doesn't bite his tongue,
aren't you?

84
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:04,750
Nobody's putting anything in his mouth.

85
00:05:04,977 --> 00:05:06,151
We just have to let him ride it out.

86
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,521
Wh... what are you gonna do?
You just can't let him die.

87
00:05:12,507 --> 00:05:16,390
Th... they're gonna come soon... in a
little while... and they'll get him out.

88
00:05:16,638 --> 00:05:17,671
You said we don't got much time.

89
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:19,361
- What if they don't get him out
from there before he...

90
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:20,282
I don't know.

91
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:23,043
I don't know, okay? I don't know.

92
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:25,510
Please, you can't quit on us now.
You just...

93
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:27,231
you just gotta try something else.

94
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:29,140
I'm out of practice.

95
00:05:29,506 --> 00:05:30,473
I've been watching.

96
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:33,120
For weeks, I've just been watching.
I...

97
00:05:35,738 --> 00:05:36,801
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:38,258 --> 00:05:39,142
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:45,303
You stopped the bleeding. That was good.

100
00:05:47,998 --> 00:05:49,163
Come... come on. Please, Doc.

101
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:52,243
I know this guy. I believe in him.

102
00:05:52,677 --> 00:05:53,680
I believe he can make it.

103
00:05:54,977 --> 00:05:56,342
You gotta believe in it, too.

104
00:05:57,337 --> 00:05:59,753
You gotta believe you can do this.
Please.

105
00:06:01,107 --> 00:06:02,212
Don't stop now.

106
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:11,012
Who's got a cell phone?

107
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:16,950
You guys good?

108
00:06:17,688 --> 00:06:18,233
You okay?

109
00:06:19,408 --> 00:06:20,063
Yeah, what do you got?

110
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:23,721
Nearly severed leg, but he had his
artery tied off, so that's something.

111
00:06:23,797 --> 00:06:25,273
Yeah. Who tied off the artery?

112
00:06:25,998 --> 00:06:27,590
Was it dr. Grey? This is her jacket.

113
00:06:28,477 --> 00:06:30,363
We found him like this.
She must have moved on.

114
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:32,050
Yeah, okay.

115
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:35,512
Doc.

116
00:06:35,906 --> 00:06:36,342
Yeah.

117
00:06:38,556 --> 00:06:39,311
What is it?

118
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:44,092
Yeah, just stabilize the fracture and get 
him to the hospital as soon as possible.

119
00:06:55,235 --> 00:06:55,720
Hey.

120
00:06:56,648 --> 00:06:57,503
You okay?

121
00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:05,213
Hey, did...did the Doctor bring you
here? Huh? Meredith?

122
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:09,061
Is Meredith okay?

123
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,633
Hi, my name's Georges.

124
00:07:49,977 --> 00:07:50,993
Is your name Chris?

125
00:07:53,325 --> 00:07:53,760
Is he yours?

126
00:07:54,626 --> 00:07:55,210
Thank you.

127
00:07:55,565 --> 00:07:56,651
Thank you very much.

128
00:08:08,005 --> 00:08:09,413
-  Do you have a new list?
- Uh, not yet.

129
00:08:09,495 --> 00:08:11,151
Nothing? How can there be no new
information?

130
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:13,612
Isn't there someone you can call?
Someone who knows something?

131
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,271
Uh, nobody knows anything right now,

132
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:18,600
- We've been here for hours waiting!
I mean, what are we supposed to do?

133
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:23,093
- Quiet!

134
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:26,412
All right, that list is all I have for
you, and it sucks, but that's it.

135
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,433
I can't believe you don't have some kind
of a system. I mean...

136
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:32,413
Give me a minute to think.
I'll come up with a damn system.

137
00:08:43,526 --> 00:08:47,201
I just want you to know that I understand
you're under a lot of pressure.

138
00:08:47,797 --> 00:08:50,033
If you... if you just need
to sit for a minute...

139
00:08:51,086 --> 00:08:52,041
or if you need a hand...

140
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:53,791
or a hug...

141
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:18,131
- Chief Webber.
- Oh, Chief, I got a guy here, and...

142
00:09:18,155 --> 00:09:20,141
and we... we can't extricate him.

143
00:09:20,165 --> 00:09:22,220
- Hold on.
- And I've tried everything.
- Hold... hold on.

144
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:24,588
- Who's this?
- It's Izzie Stevens. I'm at the dock.

145
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:26,404
I've got a patient with a
depressed skull fracture

146
00:09:26,426 --> 00:09:27,693
and probably an intracranial bleed.

147
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,553
Is he showing signs of
increased pressure?

148
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:32,050
Yes. His left pupil is blown.
He's gone limp.

149
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:34,841
He's seizing, and now his
right pupil is dilating.

150
00:09:34,936 --> 00:09:36,920
He could be herniating. What's
your E.T.A. to the hospital?

151
00:09:36,946 --> 00:09:38,922
That's what I'm saying.
We can't get him out.

152
00:09:38,988 --> 00:09:40,790
He's stuck under a car,
and we can't get him out.

153
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:43,842
- Okay, first you've got to stay calm.
- I can't stay calm.

154
00:09:44,047 --> 00:09:47,213
Calm was over minutes ago. Calm is gone.
Calm is impossibility.

155
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:49,340
I've got his best friends here,
and I can't let him die.

156
00:09:49,365 --> 00:09:51,710
So please just tell me
what I need to do.

157
00:09:57,227 --> 00:09:58,920
You need to do some burr holes.

158
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:00,171
Burr holes?

159
00:10:01,097 --> 00:10:02,792
I can't do burr holes out here.

160
00:10:02,826 --> 00:10:04,593
Do you want to save his life, Stevens?

161
00:10:04,675 --> 00:10:06,120
- Yes.
- All right.

162
00:10:06,455 --> 00:10:07,950
I need a minute to check
something out in the book,

163
00:10:07,996 --> 00:10:09,103
and then I'll talk you through it.

164
00:10:09,148 --> 00:10:10,401
You're looking it up in a book?

165
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:14,351
I'm not a neurosurgeon, Stevens, and
I want to make sure we get this right.

166
00:10:15,336 --> 00:10:18,893
Somebody find me a copy
of Boardman's neurosurgery!

167
00:10:19,677 --> 00:10:20,851
Everything okay?

168
00:10:22,926 --> 00:10:24,442
You know anything about making
burr holes?

169
00:10:25,845 --> 00:10:27,142
Done it a couple of times.

170
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:27,930
Good.

171
00:10:28,565 --> 00:10:29,713
Don't go anywhere.

172
00:10:30,595 --> 00:10:31,890
Stevens, listen to me.

173
00:10:35,806 --> 00:10:37,081
I'm gonna need a drill.

174
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,613
- There's one in my truck.
- What do you need a drill for?

175
00:10:42,536 --> 00:10:44,161
I've gotta drill holes
in your friend's head.

176
00:10:54,256 --> 00:10:55,622
Watch your back... Coming through

177
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,690
Uh, hello. I'm suturing here.

178
00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:13,492
- Sorry. I'm... What are you...
- Oh, wait... oh, you just got back?

179
00:11:13,527 --> 00:11:14,672
Yeah, I'm looking...

180
00:11:15,016 --> 00:11:17,240
- Have you, uh, seen any lost children
down here?
- Is...

181
00:11:17,245 --> 00:11:18,113
Is Meredith back, too?

182
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:19,213
'Cause I need her.
It's really important.

183
00:11:19,235 --> 00:11:21,363
Yeah, this is important. This kid's
missing. His mom's in surgery.

184
00:11:21,428 --> 00:11:23,331
- What kind of surgery?
- This kid's lost.

185
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:26,320
You didn't see it today, Cristina.

186
00:11:26,357 --> 00:11:27,383
You  weren't out there.

187
00:11:27,548 --> 00:11:28,343
I know.

188
00:11:30,836 --> 00:11:33,921
Have you seen any lost kids
down here or not?

189
00:11:34,186 --> 00:11:35,092
- Not.
- Okay.

190
00:11:35,107 --> 00:11:36,833
- Do you know where, uh, Meredith is?
- I'm leaving.

191
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:39,331
Yeah, I know.

192
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:44,470
All right, if you can
identify the patient,

193
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:46,890
- please write their name on the picture.
- I've got markers.

194
00:11:47,247 --> 00:11:51,561
These patients are in surgery, and
these patients are in the I.C.U.

195
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:52,480
This is Fatima!

196
00:11:53,315 --> 00:11:54,000
Is she okay?

197
00:11:54,277 --> 00:11:56,440
Uh, yeah. She's in...
she's in the O.R. stable.

198
00:12:01,527 --> 00:12:04,020
Okay, all these people have been
transferred from other hospitals.

199
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:05,311
Oh, and I have the details.

200
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:10,723
If it's okay...

201
00:12:11,008 --> 00:12:13,310
I got... I got a case
I need to check on.

202
00:12:15,697 --> 00:12:17,552
My husband's not on that board.

203
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:19,810
- Kelly Winter... she's not either.
- What does that mean?

204
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:24,751
It's, uh, it's, uh, they could be
in shock or...

205
00:12:25,017 --> 00:12:27,452
- walked away from the site or... 
- Just say it.

206
00:12:27,718 --> 00:12:29,803
A lot of people died. They're dead.

207
00:12:29,907 --> 00:12:31,313
W... we don't know that.

208
00:12:31,636 --> 00:12:33,610
So how can we know?

209
00:12:34,978 --> 00:12:35,640
My wife,

210
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:37,713
she wasn't in these photos either.

211
00:12:37,997 --> 00:12:38,721
But she's pregnant.

212
00:12:38,897 --> 00:12:41,101
Is...is it possible you just
didn't see her?

213
00:12:41,155 --> 00:12:41,943
She's pregnant?

214
00:13:03,957 --> 00:13:04,463
W hat?

215
00:13:05,247 --> 00:13:05,743
It's okay.

216
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:07,571
Just think. Where is she

217
00:13:07,976 --> 00:13:08,910
Which way she come?

218
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,381
It's okay take your time.

219
00:13:13,538 --> 00:13:15,301
Take all the time you need,
you're doing great.

220
00:13:17,218 --> 00:13:17,920
Where is it?

221
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:19,112
Good.

222
00:13:40,648 --> 00:13:41,070
Okay.

223
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,590
Use your words.

224
00:13:44,306 --> 00:13:46,012
Where exactly is Meredith?

225
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:14,111
Hmm. The leak in the heart is coming
from the right atrium.

226
00:14:14,428 --> 00:14:15,610
Are you gonna put her on bypass?

227
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,161
'Cause that could compromise the baby.

228
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:19,192
No, I can fix her heart
while it's still beating.

229
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:21,781
Push 40 milligrams of esmolol.

230
00:14:24,858 --> 00:14:25,713
I found her husband.

231
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:27,461
I found him.

232
00:14:28,008 --> 00:14:29,463
She's not a Jane Doe.
Her name's Casey.

233
00:14:29,605 --> 00:14:30,221
Casey Clark.

234
00:14:31,355 --> 00:14:31,630
What?

235
00:14:32,798 --> 00:14:33,510
How do you know?

236
00:14:34,517 --> 00:14:34,780
What?

237
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:37,201
How  do you know it's Casey Clark?

238
00:14:37,455 --> 00:14:39,081
Well, she's pregnant and...

239
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,330
there were hundreds
of people on that ferry,

240
00:14:41,395 --> 00:14:44,692
Alex, hundreds, and chances are that
more than one was pregnant.

241
00:14:44,706 --> 00:14:48,491
Now do not give that man hope unless
you are certain. Do not give him hope

242
00:14:48,945 --> 00:14:51,260
until you've checked every
last body in the morgue.

243
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:54,561
Dr. Burke, can I, uh...

244
00:14:54,715 --> 00:14:55,730
Yes, make it fast.

245
00:15:12,915 --> 00:15:14,551
I gotta tell you,
this group of interns...

246
00:15:14,817 --> 00:15:15,511
Emotional.

247
00:15:15,657 --> 00:15:16,482
Headstrong.

248
00:15:16,545 --> 00:15:17,811
Hot-headed, stubborn.

249
00:15:18,106 --> 00:15:19,342
They think they know everything.

250
00:15:19,898 --> 00:15:22,850
You can only give them so much rope
before they hang themselves with it.

251
00:15:23,035 --> 00:15:25,333
It's like they lose all rationality,
don't want to listen to reason.

252
00:15:25,897 --> 00:15:27,982
Jeez, Preston. Don't hold back.

253
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:32,143
She's getting hypotensive.

254
00:15:33,127 --> 00:15:36,913
I'm seeing some late decels on
the fetal heart monitor. The baby
is not getting enough blood.

255
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:38,153
Almost...

256
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:42,432
just got... one more stitch.

257
00:15:44,048 --> 00:15:44,543
Got it.

258
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:45,882
Turn on the echo.

259
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:49,972
Baby's heart rate is stabilized.

260
00:15:51,615 --> 00:15:52,120
Good.

261
00:15:52,296 --> 00:15:53,523
Then we've seen the worst of it.

262
00:16:02,538 --> 00:16:03,221
What's the deal?

263
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:07,201
Do you know how massive
this hospital is?

264
00:16:07,297 --> 00:16:09,243
How many people...
not just sick people...

265
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:13,200
Not to mention, if I'm a little kid, how
many places can I hide? He's little.

266
00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:15,881
A little kid can hide anywhere.

267
00:16:16,326 --> 00:16:17,372
What, you're looking for a kid?

268
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:19,592
Yeah.

269
00:16:21,136 --> 00:16:22,571
His mom's in surgery, and I, um...

270
00:16:23,445 --> 00:16:25,041
if I don't find him, Bailey will...

271
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,351
Well, to start, she'll change her son's
middle name to...

272
00:16:29,026 --> 00:16:29,722
Elvis or...

273
00:16:30,816 --> 00:16:31,930
Tupperware or...

274
00:16:33,887 --> 00:16:36,282
I'm not kidding. Anything will be
better than Georges.

275
00:16:36,977 --> 00:16:38,273
I know a place a kid might be.

276
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:41,480
Really?

277
00:16:53,605 --> 00:16:54,582
You could have warned me.

278
00:16:55,237 --> 00:16:57,080
Well, you didn't check
down here, right?

279
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:57,523
No.

280
00:16:58,178 --> 00:17:00,943
So stop whining and tell me
if you find a pregnant chick.

281
00:17:02,215 --> 00:17:04,500
You know, you're not the only one
with a detail that sucks.

282
00:17:05,145 --> 00:17:08,400
You know, I'm supposed to deal
with these freaked-out families.

283
00:17:09,368 --> 00:17:11,702
I'm not good with people. They should
just let me stick to patients.

284
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,802
Patients are people, especially kids.

285
00:17:16,047 --> 00:17:18,153
- You know what I mean.
- He's face down.

286
00:17:19,466 --> 00:17:20,372
How does that...

287
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,531
Come here and help me turn
his body right.

288
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:25,900
Dude... don't tell me it doesn't matter.

289
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,223
- God, I swear to...
- Dramatic much?

290
00:17:35,705 --> 00:17:36,833
This doesn't bother you?

291
00:17:37,676 --> 00:17:38,471
Any of this?

292
00:17:39,728 --> 00:17:42,143
All this death, it doesn't
mean anything to you?

293
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,421
I'm working. Why would it?

294
00:17:44,826 --> 00:17:46,610
Yeah, well, there's working and then...

295
00:17:50,317 --> 00:17:52,252
Caucasian female, about 30 years old.

296
00:17:53,777 --> 00:17:54,391
She's...

297
00:17:56,177 --> 00:17:57,172
She's pretty.

298
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,793
She looks about seven months pregnant.

299
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:18,871
Now remember, Stevens,

300
00:18:19,437 --> 00:18:22,301
that drill isn't just gonna stop
like a neurosurgical drill,

301
00:18:22,317 --> 00:18:23,420
so as soon

302
00:18:23,606 --> 00:18:27,651
as you feel a release in pressure, stop
the drill or you'll pierce his brain.

303
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:28,933
Even if I don't see blood?

304
00:18:29,105 --> 00:18:31,742
Trust your instincts, Stevens.
Trust the feel of it.

305
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:32,941
I'm ready.

306
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,450
No, wait. I need to clean the drill off
one more time.

307
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:40,263
You've cleaned it a dozen times, Stevens.
It's as clean as it's gonna get.

308
00:18:43,217 --> 00:18:43,722
You're ready?

309
00:18:46,855 --> 00:18:47,423
Yes.

310
00:18:48,656 --> 00:18:48,993
Okay.

311
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:52,472
Place three fingers above the ear

312
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:57,902
and two or three fingers in front of that
on the side where the first pupil blew.

313
00:18:58,816 --> 00:18:59,560
Got it.

314
00:18:59,956 --> 00:19:05,613
All right. Now use a scalpel to make a
vertical scalp incision down to the skull.

315
00:19:08,885 --> 00:19:09,702
Jeez.

316
00:19:10,285 --> 00:19:11,792
I see a lot of blood, a lot.

317
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,170
Superficial bleeders.
Nothing to worry about.

318
00:19:15,018 --> 00:19:16,112
Are you at the skull?

319
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:16,711
Yes.

320
00:19:17,246 --> 00:19:19,572
Drill a hole in the middle
of the incision.

321
00:19:25,388 --> 00:19:26,551
Oh, God.

322
00:19:26,735 --> 00:19:27,623
Okay, that can't happen.

323
00:19:27,836 --> 00:19:28,752
Do you understand me?

324
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:30,260
Sounds can't happen.

325
00:19:30,596 --> 00:19:33,863
Freaking out can't happen. Because
if you freak out, I'm gonna freak out.

326
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,873
And I'm the one holding a power
tool to your friend's brain.

327
00:19:36,398 --> 00:19:39,413
So if you're gonna vomit, if you're
gonna make sounds, step away.

328
00:19:39,837 --> 00:19:42,332
If you're gonna stay here,
you have to pull it together.

329
00:19:42,768 --> 00:19:43,410
Okay?

330
00:19:47,146 --> 00:19:47,893
We're good, Doc.

331
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,070
Okay. I'm ready.

332
00:19:52,696 --> 00:19:55,490
The temporal bone's only gonna be
a couple of millimetres thick.

333
00:20:14,575 --> 00:20:15,903
Okay, I'm in.

334
00:20:16,696 --> 00:20:18,071
But the dura looks fine.

335
00:20:18,758 --> 00:20:20,473
You're gonna have to go in again.

336
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:22,503
Frontal lobe, right?

337
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:23,720
That's right.

338
00:20:24,085 --> 00:20:27,072
Just behind the hairline, a few
centimetres off the midline.

339
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,440
This bone will be thicker,

340
00:20:28,955 --> 00:20:31,530
about five times as thick
as the temporal bone.

341
00:20:31,957 --> 00:20:32,862
Okay.

342
00:20:34,498 --> 00:20:35,350
Got it.

343
00:20:52,966 --> 00:20:54,291
Second hole done.

344
00:20:54,405 --> 00:20:55,423
What do you see?

345
00:20:55,738 --> 00:20:59,530
I think I see blood.
I... I see some blood.

346
00:20:59,537 --> 00:21:01,361
Okay, now this is important.

347
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:04,081
Drill around the hole
to expand the opening.

348
00:21:04,108 --> 00:21:05,900
You have to try and
relieve the pressure.

349
00:21:08,245 --> 00:21:09,083
Okay.

350
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:20,953
Okay.

351
00:21:21,177 --> 00:21:23,643
Uh, the hole is about
2 centimetres around now.

352
00:21:24,256 --> 00:21:26,003
I see blood. I definitely see blood.

353
00:21:26,325 --> 00:21:28,480
Try to evacuate as much
of the clot as you can.

354
00:21:29,128 --> 00:21:30,600
With what? I don't have suction.

355
00:21:30,925 --> 00:21:33,633
Use your finger, gauze, anything. 

356
00:21:36,135 --> 00:21:37,273
I see clotted blood.

357
00:21:37,437 --> 00:21:38,851
- No arterial?
- No.

358
00:21:39,585 --> 00:21:41,591
Good. Now how does the dura look?

359
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,390
Is it bulging or does it look lax?

360
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:44,691
It looks like it's...

361
00:21:45,116 --> 00:21:47,701
pulsating regularly with the heartbeat.
That's another good, right?

362
00:21:49,105 --> 00:21:50,280
That's great, Stevens.

363
00:21:50,808 --> 00:21:53,760
If  it's pulsating, that means
blood and oxygen are entering the brain.

364
00:21:54,988 --> 00:21:57,111
Now pack it with gauze so
you can minimize the bleeding.

365
00:21:57,588 --> 00:22:02,032
O... Okay.
Now get that rescue right in here.

366
00:22:07,538 --> 00:22:08,611
Nicely done, Stevens.

367
00:22:09,755 --> 00:22:11,471
- Is that it?
- Is he... Is he gonna be okay?

368
00:22:11,905 --> 00:22:13,311
We've relieved the pressure
on his brain,

369
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:15,073
but he's still got a lot
of other injuries.

370
00:22:16,738 --> 00:22:17,162
Hey.

371
00:22:19,376 --> 00:22:20,551
His eyes are open.

372
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:43,922
Hey, kid.

373
00:22:44,986 --> 00:22:45,440
Kid.

374
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:48,760
You okay?

375
00:22:53,928 --> 00:22:55,183
You need to come with me.

376
00:22:57,457 --> 00:22:57,791
Kid?

377
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,370
E.T.A. is five minutes.

378
00:23:58,137 --> 00:23:58,910
How is she doing?

379
00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:00,760
Good. No intestinal damage.

380
00:24:01,216 --> 00:24:04,500
Missed all her vital organs. She's
almost done here. You find her son?

381
00:24:05,635 --> 00:24:07,802
I've looked everywhere.
I've been in contact with the scene,

382
00:24:07,857 --> 00:24:10,401
with Mercy West, with Seattle
Presbyterian. I've checked in,

383
00:24:13,377 --> 00:24:14,060
he's lost

384
00:24:15,327 --> 00:24:15,860
or...

385
00:24:17,315 --> 00:24:18,953
- or, uh...
- He's in the water.

386
00:24:22,397 --> 00:24:25,851
So when she wakes up, I get to inform
her that she's not going to die,

387
00:24:25,895 --> 00:24:27,223
she's just gonna want to die.

388
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:29,920
I'm sorry. I will... Okay,
I'm gonna keep looking.

389
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:30,573
Yeah, you do that.

390
00:24:37,627 --> 00:24:39,831
His right pupil's not dilated anymore,
and he's normotensive

391
00:24:39,908 --> 00:24:41,441
but his pulse is still up in the 130s.

392
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:43,561
- Okay, what's his neurological status?
- G.C.S. is 8.

393
00:24:43,806 --> 00:24:45,343
I'm sorry. I ran out of sterile drapes.

394
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,313
I had to use some guy's t-shirt.
It wasn't sweaty or anything.

395
00:24:47,326 --> 00:24:48,160
He was a clean guy, but--

396
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,810
Okay, call the O.R.
Tell'em we're coming up.

397
00:24:50,006 --> 00:24:51,603
I also dropped the scalpel in the field,

398
00:24:51,626 --> 00:24:54,561
and by that time, I had used all the
alcohol swabs on the drill bit, so

399
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:57,371
I think we should load him up on
antibiotics, lots and lots of antibiotics.

400
00:24:57,427 --> 00:24:59,572
Stevens you put a drill
through a man's skull

401
00:24:59,645 --> 00:25:01,782
and didn't hit his brain.
You saved his life.

402
00:25:05,118 --> 00:25:07,162
Get cleaned up and get to the O.R.
You got work to do.

403
00:25:07,438 --> 00:25:08,042
The O.R.?

404
00:25:08,658 --> 00:25:09,723
Yes, the O.R.

405
00:25:10,826 --> 00:25:12,211
You're officially off probation.

406
00:25:22,218 --> 00:25:22,932
Oh, Cristina!

407
00:25:23,157 --> 00:25:24,862
Oh, my god. You are not gonna
believe what I just did.

408
00:25:24,878 --> 00:25:25,661
I'm gonna tell you,

409
00:25:25,848 --> 00:25:27,232
but you're not gonna believe it. You're
gonna think I made the whole thing up.

410
00:25:27,238 --> 00:25:27,612
You're back?

411
00:25:27,728 --> 00:25:28,453
Is Meredith back?

412
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,630
- I drilled a hole into this guy's skull
- What?

413
00:25:30,826 --> 00:25:32,130
Several holes, actually,

414
00:25:32,257 --> 00:25:34,240
with a drill I borrowed
from a guy named Vince,

415
00:25:34,318 --> 00:25:36,263
patched the hole with freakin'tissue,

416
00:25:36,306 --> 00:25:38,411
then brought him back here, and now I
get to scrub in on his craniotomy.

417
00:25:38,447 --> 00:25:39,213
So you haven't seen Meredith?

418
00:25:39,225 --> 00:25:41,263
It was like a ride,
this crazy roller coaster ride

419
00:25:41,288 --> 00:25:43,283
with adrenalin shooting out of my ears.

420
00:25:43,438 --> 00:25:45,951
You'd think that my hands would be shaking,
but they weren't. There was no shaking.

421
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:48,511
- Did I mention the drill?
- Okay, Izzie,

422
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:50,982
I get it. You are a hero.

423
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:54,663
I am jealous. But I need to know
where the hell Meredith is.

424
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:56,252
Okay.

425
00:25:56,995 --> 00:26:00,010
I don't know where the hell Meredith is.
But she should be back here.

426
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:01,272
I didn't see her at the scene...

427
00:26:01,747 --> 00:26:04,481
The scene where I was a rock star,
by the way.

428
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:06,861
Did I mention I'm off probation?

429
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:08,580
Rock star.

430
00:26:22,726 --> 00:26:24,323
These photos are fatalities.

431
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:25,782
I know it's difficult,

432
00:26:26,155 --> 00:26:27,723
but please try to I.D. who you can.

433
00:26:56,985 --> 00:26:58,811
We've agreed to let you do the honors...

434
00:26:59,836 --> 00:27:02,122
A few more burr holes
to start the craniotomy.

435
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:03,341
Really?

436
00:27:04,137 --> 00:27:07,151
You saved his life. You might as well
help finish what you started.

437
00:27:07,766 --> 00:27:09,911
After I strip off the periosteum,

438
00:27:10,156 --> 00:27:13,373
you can see what a high-speed pneumatic
neurosurgical drill feels like.

439
00:27:16,787 --> 00:27:18,283
Drill, please.

440
00:27:52,395 --> 00:27:57,772
I, uh, we have two pregnant women. One
of'em is... she's in bad shape. She's...

441
00:27:58,137 --> 00:28:00,162
pretty beat up.
She might be hard to recognize.

442
00:28:01,157 --> 00:28:02,262
I... I don't know.

443
00:28:03,956 --> 00:28:06,650
- What color is her hair?
- Brown. Reddish.

444
00:28:07,698 --> 00:28:11,440
My wife my wife is blonde.
Brownish, but blonde.

445
00:28:12,247 --> 00:28:15,361
Oh, yeah. Sometimes the blood makes
it look darker like that, you know, red.

446
00:28:15,638 --> 00:28:17,883
I know you can't tell from the photo,
but her eyes are...

447
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:18,673
they're pretty distinctive.

448
00:28:20,758 --> 00:28:22,780
Casey's eyes are very distinctive.

449
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:24,283
Yeah, brown,

450
00:28:25,418 --> 00:28:28,962
but not that really dark, dark brown.
More golden and... and really warm.

451
00:28:29,086 --> 00:28:29,840
That's not her.

452
00:28:30,678 --> 00:28:34,690
Casey's eyes are blue, very, very blue.

453
00:28:37,935 --> 00:28:39,611
I'm sorry.

454
00:28:41,736 --> 00:28:44,651
I thought you...
You said you had two pregnant women.

455
00:28:45,608 --> 00:28:46,852
Yeah, we, um...

456
00:28:48,098 --> 00:28:49,441
the other one is, um...

457
00:28:51,086 --> 00:28:51,890
she's...

458
00:28:53,118 --> 00:28:55,970
oh, god. Oh, no. Oh, god.

459
00:28:56,866 --> 00:28:58,142
Oh, Casey.

460
00:29:19,226 --> 00:29:19,893
What do we got?

461
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,182
Jane Doe, hypothermic drowning...

462
00:29:21,036 --> 00:29:23,401
She is not a Jane Doe.
It's Meredith Grey. It's Meredith.

463
00:29:24,748 --> 00:29:25,280
Derek.

464
00:29:26,315 --> 00:29:26,741
Derek.

465
00:29:27,186 --> 00:29:28,822
- Derek, how long has she been down?
- I don't know.

466
00:29:29,736 --> 00:29:30,541
She's alive.

467
00:29:30,706 --> 00:29:31,880
- One, two, three...
- Derek.

468
00:29:32,078 --> 00:29:32,653
She's alive.

469
00:29:33,077 --> 00:29:35,390
Okay, look, I need you
to help me get her inside.

470
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,522
Clear a trauma bay, stat!

471
00:29:39,886 --> 00:29:40,631
Move it!

472
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:53,382
How was your surgery, dr. Burke?

473
00:29:53,695 --> 00:29:56,172
Well, the patient is out of
the woods now, dr. Yang.

474
00:29:56,387 --> 00:29:57,162
Thanks for asking.

475
00:29:57,586 --> 00:29:58,111
Ow!

476
00:29:59,685 --> 00:30:00,491
You're numbed.

477
00:30:01,286 --> 00:30:02,451
Whatever. It looked harsh.

478
00:30:03,465 --> 00:30:04,280
Fran, finish this, please.

479
00:30:13,738 --> 00:30:15,230
- What is your problem?
- You know, everyone's back.

480
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,752
Everyone's back except her.

481
00:30:17,225 --> 00:30:20,491
And I listen to her every day
about her McLove life

482
00:30:20,655 --> 00:30:23,990
McDreamy and McCrap, and, and on the
one day, the one day I have a thing...

483
00:30:24,728 --> 00:30:25,773
she disappears.

484
00:30:26,127 --> 00:30:26,602
Meredith?

485
00:30:26,936 --> 00:30:27,833
This is about Meredith?

486
00:30:29,066 --> 00:30:30,770
- She doesn't know yet.
- Meredith?

487
00:30:30,976 --> 00:30:32,050
She's my person.

488
00:30:33,687 --> 00:30:34,173
Right.

489
00:30:36,258 --> 00:30:38,951
And if Meredith doesn't approve,
then what?

490
00:30:38,518 --> 00:30:41,423
No, no, no. This is not about getting
her approval. It's about...

491
00:30:41,496 --> 00:30:41,941
What?

492
00:30:43,196 --> 00:30:44,722
Telling her makes it...

493
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:46,983
makes it...

494
00:30:51,255 --> 00:30:52,440
if I murdered someone,

495
00:30:52,848 --> 00:30:56,753
she's the person I'd call to help me drag
the corpse across the living room floor.

496
00:30:57,976 --> 00:31:01,490
Okay. See, now you're likening
someone here to a corpse.

497
00:31:02,305 --> 00:31:03,190
I'm done.

498
00:31:05,255 --> 00:31:06,392
She's my person.

499
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:13,841
Removing the bone flap.

500
00:31:16,678 --> 00:31:17,911
Ready with suction.

501
00:31:18,648 --> 00:31:19,503
Looking good.

502
00:31:20,305 --> 00:31:21,120
Yes.

503
00:31:21,896 --> 00:31:23,371
Yes, it is.

504
00:31:27,126 --> 00:31:29,291
Dr. Stevens, it's your pager.

505
00:31:29,807 --> 00:31:30,803
That's okay. It can wait.

506
00:31:31,048 --> 00:31:32,540
I think you want to take this page.

507
00:31:44,175 --> 00:31:45,651
How's she doing?

508
00:31:46,578 --> 00:31:48,032
She's holding steady for now.

509
00:31:49,677 --> 00:31:50,761
Anybody claim her yet?

510
00:31:51,196 --> 00:31:51,831
No.

511
00:31:53,687 --> 00:31:55,250
She's still a Jane Doe.

512
00:32:01,997 --> 00:32:02,971
I'd notice.

513
00:32:03,637 --> 00:32:04,271
What?

514
00:32:09,976 --> 00:32:11,241
If you went missing...

515
00:32:13,316 --> 00:32:14,100
I'd notice.

516
00:32:49,165 --> 00:32:51,240
- Okay, I need a little more suction, please.
- Callie.

517
00:32:52,127 --> 00:32:53,940
O'Malley, I'm working. What do you want?

518
00:32:54,048 --> 00:32:56,663
I read on the board you're doing an
internal fixation of the lumbar spine

519
00:32:56,676 --> 00:32:59,021
on a John Doe from
the ferry crash, age 7.

520
00:32:59,147 --> 00:32:59,871
That's right.

521
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,050
Can I see his face?

522
00:33:02,596 --> 00:33:05,283
- I'm in the middle of surgery.
- I know.

523
00:33:09,805 --> 00:33:11,323
Is this boy your patient?

524
00:33:12,748 --> 00:33:15,342
I... I know the picture's half smeared
and hard to see, but...

525
00:33:17,736 --> 00:33:20,783
please tell me it's him.
Tell me he has been right here

526
00:33:21,435 --> 00:33:23,820
under my nose, open on
your table all day and not...

527
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:26,790
drifting along the
bottom of the ocean.

528
00:33:28,797 --> 00:33:31,771
Just... please tell me that.

529
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,060
Put the photo under the light
so I can get a better look.

530
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:41,082
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, that's my kid.
I could spot those goofy ears anywhere.

531
00:33:41,968 --> 00:33:42,840
- Really?
- Really.

532
00:33:51,308 --> 00:33:52,523
Callie O'Malley...

533
00:33:53,245 --> 00:33:55,940
I can't kiss you right now because
you're scrubbed in, but tonight...

534
00:33:56,565 --> 00:33:57,390
when you get home,

535
00:33:58,328 --> 00:33:59,453
- I am going to...
- Okay,

536
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:00,610
Okay. All right. You know what,

537
00:34:00,778 --> 00:34:03,012
people? Let's focus here.
George, I'm working.

538
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:03,303
Yeah.

539
00:34:03,546 --> 00:34:03,911
I'm...

540
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:05,660
I'm working.

541
00:34:05,988 --> 00:34:06,481
Okay.

542
00:34:06,685 --> 00:34:07,740
So... yeah.

543
00:34:08,466 --> 00:34:08,871
Bye.

544
00:34:24,425 --> 00:34:26,382
Oh, my god!

545
00:34:28,028 --> 00:34:29,052
Oh, you're safe.

546
00:34:29,965 --> 00:34:31,020
You're safe.

547
00:34:31,796 --> 00:34:35,303
Oh, honey, mommy's sorry
she got lost.

548
00:34:35,745 --> 00:34:36,730
Oh, Lisa.

549
00:34:38,418 --> 00:34:40,803
They could only put a 20-guage
I.V. in, but I think it blew.

550
00:34:41,048 --> 00:34:43,520
I'll start a central line, but you
have to get out of the way.

551
00:34:43,555 --> 00:34:46,822
- We... We put, uh, 3 milligram
of epi down the E.T. tube...
- Derek!

552
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:49,270
The last dose was three minutes
ago. We should push...

553
00:34:49,297 --> 00:34:50,171
Shepherd, get out.

554
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:53,933
I think we should push
just 1 at... atropine.

555
00:34:54,377 --> 00:34:56,742
I think I saw some reactivity
in her pupils

556
00:34:56,827 --> 00:34:59,552
before the atropine, and I think
she might have actually had some

557
00:34:59,736 --> 00:35:01,481
- cardiac activity...
- Shepherd, get out.

558
00:35:05,455 --> 00:35:07,462
we need to put an external pacer
on just to make sure.

559
00:35:07,525 --> 00:35:08,772
We need to save her life.

560
00:35:09,836 --> 00:35:11,591
You can't do this.
We need to do this.

561
00:35:11,817 --> 00:35:12,410
Now go.

562
00:35:12,555 --> 00:35:14,350
One, two...

563
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:20,580
Go.

564
00:35:21,275 --> 00:35:22,972
Three, four, five.

565
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:29,750
Okay, she has a new 18-guage in her
left A.C. push 1 of epi through it.

566
00:35:43,815 --> 00:35:46,570
The chief is working on her, man.

567
00:35:46,975 --> 00:35:48,260
He threw me out.

568
00:35:55,836 --> 00:35:57,771
What do you need?

569
00:36:03,847 --> 00:36:05,771
I need you to go in there.

570
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:16,491
Give me a new warm blanket.
Her temp's still only at 80 degrees.

571
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:17,370
What can I do?

572
00:36:18,127 --> 00:36:19,371
She needs an A.B.G.

573
00:36:19,975 --> 00:36:20,642
Whoa.

574
00:36:20,857 --> 00:36:21,692
Was that v-fib?

575
00:36:22,117 --> 00:36:24,202
Charge to 300.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

576
00:36:24,705 --> 00:36:25,101
Okay.

577
00:36:25,356 --> 00:36:25,903
Clear.

578
00:36:27,815 --> 00:36:28,771
Back to asystole.

579
00:36:29,025 --> 00:36:29,941
Keep compressions going.

580
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:32,083
Oh, my god.

581
00:36:32,255 --> 00:36:33,343
She's hypothermic.

582
00:36:34,788 --> 00:36:35,540
Uh...

583
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:38,340
Have you tried a warm peritoneal lavage

584
00:36:38,368 --> 00:36:41,442
or even a continuous
bladder lavage with warm fluids?

585
00:36:41,835 --> 00:36:42,891
You could do a thoracotomy.

586
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:43,981
Get back the A.B.G.

587
00:36:44,356 --> 00:36:45,723
Okay, now let's go, people.

588
00:37:32,886 --> 00:37:34,131
How's her temp?

589
00:37:37,227 --> 00:37:40,441
- Only up to 81 now.
- Come on Meredith. Don't do this.

590
00:38:00,117 --> 00:38:02,030
- It's Meredith?
- Yeah.

591
00:38:02,225 --> 00:38:04,431
- Are you sure? Did you see her?
Because it could be anybody.
- It's Meredith

592
00:38:08,948 --> 00:38:09,451
Oh.

593
00:38:16,557 --> 00:38:17,043
Oh.

594
00:38:18,976 --> 00:38:19,490
Oh.

595
00:38:20,277 --> 00:38:23,501
- Uh... She will come through this.
- You don't know that.

596
00:38:25,016 --> 00:38:26,760
She will come through this.

597
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:32,901
People die.

598
00:38:34,157 --> 00:38:35,962
I know people die.

599
00:38:37,308 --> 00:38:42,740
People die in front of us every day.
But I believe Meredith will survive this.

600
00:38:43,295 --> 00:38:44,202
I believe...

601
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:46,413
I believe... I...

602
00:38:49,055 --> 00:38:51,861
I... I believe in the good.

603
00:38:57,617 --> 00:38:59,781
I believe that it's been
a hell of a year.

604
00:39:00,336 --> 00:39:04,231
And I believe that in the face of
overwhelming evidence to the contrary,

605
00:39:05,238 --> 00:39:06,511
we will all be okay.

606
00:39:08,456 --> 00:39:09,961
I believe a lot of things.

607
00:39:12,855 --> 00:39:14,131
I believe that...

608
00:39:15,588 --> 00:39:17,693
I believe that Denny
is always with me.

609
00:39:20,306 --> 00:39:21,412
And I believe

610
00:39:22,305 --> 00:39:25,881
that if I eat a tub of butter and no
one sees me, the calories don't count.

611
00:39:28,007 --> 00:39:35,053
And I believe that surgeons who prefer
staples over stitches are just lazy.

612
00:39:37,546 --> 00:39:42,070
And I believe that you are a man who
made a terrible mistake marrying Callie.

613
00:39:44,745 --> 00:39:46,440
And I believe that because
I'm your best friend,

614
00:39:46,627 --> 00:39:48,920
I can tell you this,
and we can be okay.

615
00:39:49,298 --> 00:39:51,251
I believe even though
you made this mistake,

616
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:52,903
you will be okay.

617
00:40:05,626 --> 00:40:08,741
I believe we survive, George.

618
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:14,191
I believe that believing we survive

619
00:40:15,306 --> 00:40:18,371
is what makes us survive.

620
00:40:24,786 --> 00:40:27,590
She's gonna be okay.

621
00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:37,221
Push another epi.

622
00:40:38,757 --> 00:40:40,160
How many is that?

623
00:40:40,427 --> 00:40:42,793
This is her fourth round, Sir.

624
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:46,053
We've been here
20 minutes.

625
00:40:46,535 --> 00:40:47,812
Still in asystole.

626
00:40:53,475 --> 00:40:55,121
We're losing her.

627
00:41:35,007 --> 00:41:35,743
Hey.

628
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:38,313
Hey.

629
00:41:43,356 --> 00:41:44,863
Am I...

630
00:41:46,776 --> 00:41:47,802
dead?

631
00:41:49,788 --> 00:41:51,320
Damn right, you are.

632
00:41:59,227 --> 00:41:59,753
Holy...
