1
00:00:03,992 --> 00:00:05,990
<i>No one believes their life
will turn out</i>

2
00:00:06,014 --> 00:00:07,374
<i>just kind of okay.</i>

3
00:00:09,235 --> 00:00:10,805
<i>We all think we're going to be great.</i>

4
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:13,765
<i>And from the day
we decide to be surgeons,</i>

5
00:00:14,283 --> 00:00:16,487
<i>we are filled with expectation...</i>

6
00:00:17,545 --> 00:00:19,925
<i>expectations of the trails
we will blaze,</i>

7
00:00:20,474 --> 00:00:21,549
<i>the people we will help,</i>

8
00:00:22,144 --> 00:00:23,345
<i>the difference we will make...</i>

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,712
<i>great expectations of who we will be,</i>

10
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,500
<i>where we will go.</i>

11
00:00:30,142 --> 00:00:32,608
<i>And then we get there.</i>

12
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:43,924
Meredith...

13
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:45,713
would you like seconds ?

14
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:46,451
I'm great.

15
00:00:46,865 --> 00:00:49,243
Maybe Cristina would like some.
Cristina, would you like some ?

16
00:00:49,268 --> 00:00:50,350
I only made enough for three.

17
00:00:50,787 --> 00:00:52,303
You just said there was seconds.

18
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,903
This is, uh, awkward.

19
00:00:58,018 --> 00:00:59,052
You know, we can go,

20
00:00:59,188 --> 00:01:00,670
and... And you two can talk.

21
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:01,431
- Oh, we're talking.
- We're talking.

22
00:01:01,585 --> 00:01:02,731
To each other.

23
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,262
You're enjoying your meal at the
international house of silence ?

24
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:08,553
Burke, you have to feed cristina.

25
00:01:08,648 --> 00:01:10,471
She doesn't cook,
and she will starve to death.

26
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:11,341
I have cereal.

27
00:01:11,657 --> 00:01:14,900
You two live together.
Someone has to be the first to speak.

28
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,060
I am giving a...

29
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:17,493
a dinner party.

30
00:01:17,647 --> 00:01:19,283
If she wants to sit there,
she can sit there.

31
00:01:19,415 --> 00:01:20,322
Let's just

32
00:01:20,406 --> 00:01:23,042
enjoy our evening
and talk about something else.

33
00:01:26,245 --> 00:01:27,951
I heard a crazy rumor today

34
00:01:27,998 --> 00:01:29,093
from one of the scrub nurses

35
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:30,630
that Richard was retiring.

36
00:01:31,816 --> 00:01:32,982
That's an interesting rumor.

37
00:01:33,486 --> 00:01:34,852
What ? It's true ?

38
00:01:36,028 --> 00:01:38,001
Richard's gonna name
a new chief of surgery ?

39
00:01:38,908 --> 00:01:39,540
He asked Burke.

40
00:01:39,938 --> 00:01:42,711
But Burke took himself out of the
running, which apparently is my fault

41
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,162
for being a part of the team.

42
00:01:44,606 --> 00:01:45,353
He asked you ?

43
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:47,351
Who wants dessert ?

44
00:01:50,157 --> 00:01:51,053
It's so sad.

45
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:52,483
She's not talking to him.

46
00:01:52,525 --> 00:01:53,740
He's not talking to her.

47
00:01:53,756 --> 00:01:56,261
He said that when he retired,
I would become chief.

48
00:01:56,388 --> 00:01:58,421
No, no, no, no, no.

49
00:01:58,477 --> 00:02:00,193
He asks Burke.

50
00:02:00,256 --> 00:02:01,490
I don't think they're gonna make it.

51
00:02:01,818 --> 00:02:03,362
He said to me,
"Shep, you're my man."

52
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:04,442
Not Burke.

53
00:02:04,798 --> 00:02:07,650
How can two people be in a
relationship and not talk ?

54
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,730
I am supposed to be chief.

55
00:02:13,278 --> 00:02:14,422
George, can I come in ?

56
00:02:14,776 --> 00:02:16,761
I made you some cookies,
some brownies, some muffins,

57
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:17,891
of course... I always make muffins.

58
00:02:18,265 --> 00:02:19,190
Oh, thank god you're here.

59
00:02:19,228 --> 00:02:20,520
I can't take anymore.

60
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:22,721
Three times already tonight,
and he's getting ready for a fourth.

61
00:02:23,816 --> 00:02:25,520
Are you talking about... Oh.

62
00:02:26,316 --> 00:02:28,852
Oh, ew. You know, I'd get it
if he were crying or depressed,

63
00:02:28,906 --> 00:02:31,092
and I know we all deal with it different
ways, but this is not grieving.

64
00:02:31,206 --> 00:02:33,122
This is my legs being bent
in ways my legs do not go.

65
00:02:33,148 --> 00:02:35,362
And I know. I know
his dad died. I get it.

66
00:02:35,407 --> 00:02:36,682
I feel horrible for him. But...

67
00:02:38,088 --> 00:02:38,572
okay ?

68
00:02:38,697 --> 00:02:40,141
I'm gonna give you guys some privacy.

69
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,830
- I'm going far, far...
- No, no, you stay.

70
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:43,350
You take over for me, okay ?

71
00:02:43,377 --> 00:02:45,030
- Callie torres!
- No, I don't... not like that.

72
00:02:45,956 --> 00:02:46,661
I am giving him to you.

73
00:02:46,696 --> 00:02:49,352
You are now officially on
george watch 24/7, okay ?

74
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,452
You are his friend. Yay!

75
00:02:50,495 --> 00:02:51,762
And I need a break.

76
00:02:51,786 --> 00:02:53,070
- I need to heal. I need to heal.
- No. No.

77
00:02:53,185 --> 00:02:54,761
But what am I supposed to--

78
00:02:54,805 --> 00:02:55,490
Callie.

79
00:02:57,188 --> 00:02:59,312
- Thank you. Good-bye.
- No. Callie

80
00:02:59,556 --> 00:03:01,840
What is taking you so...

81
00:03:05,475 --> 00:03:06,082
oh !

82
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:09,312
Uh,  she... she had to go.

83
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:10,922
Are you hungry ?

84
00:03:14,186 --> 00:03:14,930
Hey.

85
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,370
Oh, dr. Karev. Hello.

86
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:18,922
What's wrong with you ?

87
00:03:19,197 --> 00:03:21,421
Me? No, I'm good.
I'm good. I'm all good, all...

88
00:03:21,737 --> 00:03:22,333
good.

89
00:03:22,865 --> 00:03:25,183
- You've been avoiding me for a week.
- No, I have not.

90
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:26,860
Okay, fine. Forget it.

91
00:03:28,997 --> 00:03:30,171
I kissed Karev.

92
00:03:30,506 --> 00:03:32,090
George has become a sex machine.

93
00:03:34,397 --> 00:03:36,121
George has turned into a sex machine.

94
00:03:37,645 --> 00:03:40,171
Are you hearing me ? A machine of sex.
We have to do something.

95
00:03:40,358 --> 00:03:41,241
What's wrong with you people ?

96
00:03:41,508 --> 00:03:43,540
Derek kept me up all night
with his ranting.

97
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:45,971
Cristina and Burke still are not
speaking to each other.

98
00:03:45,998 --> 00:03:47,211
Oh, you know what ? I'm fine.

99
00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:49,220
I mean, I'm just not gonna be
the first one talking.

100
00:03:49,345 --> 00:03:51,011
I mean, he has to talk
'cause I'm in the right.

101
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:52,681
Talking first is for losers.

102
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:53,252
I'm winning.

103
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:53,981
And Alex

104
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:55,920
I don't know what's wrong with Alex.

105
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:56,413
I'm good.

106
00:03:56,577 --> 00:03:57,063
I'm all good.

107
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:58,862
Let me just remind you

108
00:03:59,107 --> 00:04:01,270
that I'm still recovering
from the death of my fiancé,

109
00:04:01,306 --> 00:04:02,643
the demise of my surgical career,

110
00:04:02,685 --> 00:04:04,651
the fact that I was forced
to deposit an $8-million check

111
00:04:04,686 --> 00:04:06,650
that I was saving for a good cause even
though I haven't found a good cause,

112
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:09,273
and I'm the only one here under care
of a shrink. I could blow any minute.

113
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:11,020
Now George's dad has died.

114
00:04:11,045 --> 00:04:12,132
It has turned him into a sex machine.

115
00:04:12,157 --> 00:04:14,272
I'm gonna need a little help with that,
so one of you better pull it together.

116
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:16,270
Hey,

117
00:04:16,327 --> 00:04:19,100
anyone seen callie ? I kinda need
to find her for something.

118
00:04:20,098 --> 00:04:21,563
Last I heard, perpetual sex 

119
00:04:21,655 --> 00:04:23,141
was not one of the five stages of grief.

120
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:23,811
But denial is.

121
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,240
That's not what I'm do...

122
00:04:25,637 --> 00:04:27,430
You shouldn't be listening
at other people's doors.

123
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:29,511
You were in the hallway naked.
I saw you.

124
00:04:29,557 --> 00:04:30,613
Oh, I blocked that out.

125
00:04:30,818 --> 00:04:31,490
Denial.

126
00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:32,661
- Dr. Montgomery.
- Yeah.

127
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,120
Is sex another form of denial ?

128
00:04:34,646 --> 00:04:35,343
W hat?

129
00:04:37,396 --> 00:04:38,202
What do you know ?

130
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:45,731
That... that you have a G.Y.N. Patient
in here that you want us to see.

131
00:04:46,905 --> 00:04:47,711
That's right.

132
00:04:49,655 --> 00:04:50,623
That's right. I do.

133
00:04:51,376 --> 00:04:51,862
Shall we ?

134
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:58,220
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

135
00:04:58,456 --> 00:04:59,201
- Chief !
- Chief !

136
00:05:00,058 --> 00:05:01,050
Chief. I gotta talk to the chief.

137
00:05:01,078 --> 00:05:02,702
Well, so do I, and I was here first.

138
00:05:02,725 --> 00:05:04,932
I have a meeting to get to,
a very important meeting.

139
00:05:04,965 --> 00:05:05,790
I'll talk quickly.

140
00:05:05,945 --> 00:05:07,651
Get in, too, Shep,
if you can make it fast.

141
00:05:07,705 --> 00:05:08,930
Mine's not fast. Mine is epic.

142
00:05:09,006 --> 00:05:10,091
Then we'll have to talk later.

143
00:05:14,136 --> 00:05:15,210
Why are you wearing a tie ?

144
00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:17,238
And why are you smiling like that ?

145
00:05:18,031 --> 00:05:20,654
You have the length of this elevator
ride, Miranda. Use it well.

146
00:05:20,796 --> 00:05:23,073
I have two words for you, chief...
Free clinic.

147
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:24,162
What ?

148
00:05:24,286 --> 00:05:26,663
I want Seattle Grace
to open a free clinic.

149
00:05:26,765 --> 00:05:29,021
- I know, it's a big undertaking, but...
- This isn't even surgical.

150
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:30,483
I've done all the research.

151
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,403
Miranda, there's all kind
of hoops to jump through...

152
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:36,181
funding, you have to get
the department heads to okay it.

153
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,611
Well, if I get the support,

154
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:39,021
will you consider this ?

155
00:05:40,956 --> 00:05:41,751
I'll think about it.

156
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:44,522
I can't imagine why
you want to take this on.

157
00:05:45,226 --> 00:05:46,022
You're a surgeon.

158
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:47,881
I gotta get to my meeting now,

159
00:05:51,128 --> 00:05:52,850
Your chart says you've been
having some pain and bleeding ?

160
00:05:52,947 --> 00:05:54,021
She has, for weeks.

161
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:55,091
It's not a big deal.

162
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:56,570
I had to drag her in here.

163
00:05:56,707 --> 00:05:58,463
On our one day off
from the restaurant.

164
00:05:58,467 --> 00:06:00,191
Just let the doctors check you out.

165
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:03,593
A lot of doctors.
She needs three people for a pap smear ?

166
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:05,342
Actually, it's not a pap smear.

167
00:06:05,377 --> 00:06:08,303
It's a pelvic exam.
And since this is a teaching hospital,

168
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,253
I was going to have one of the interns

169
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,831
do the exam, but if you're uncomfortable

170
00:06:13,048 --> 00:06:14,392
- with that...
- No, it's fine.

171
00:06:15,098 --> 00:06:16,323
I'm helping you guys
learn something, right ?

172
00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:18,100
Okay, Stevens.

173
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:23,670
Jilly, I'm just gonna,
warm the speculum for comfort.

174
00:06:23,706 --> 00:06:25,840
So if you'll just relax your knees...

175
00:06:27,276 --> 00:06:28,312
You don't have to stay here

176
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:31,620
Of course I'm staying. We do everything
together. We might as well do this.

177
00:06:32,857 --> 00:06:34,852
Rachel and I were born two days apart.

178
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:37,343
That's nice that your friendship
has stayed so strong.

179
00:06:37,946 --> 00:06:39,432
Cradle to grave, right ?

180
00:06:40,716 --> 00:06:41,823
Cradle to grave.

181
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:47,532
So just relax this muscle for me.
You're gonna feel the speculum.

182
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:51,812
Dr. Montgomery.

183
00:06:59,658 --> 00:07:03,322
- Okay, uh... Jilly
- Wait.

184
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,512
He didn't get to look.

185
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:09,292
I don't have to.

186
00:07:10,155 --> 00:07:14,201
You  said this was a teaching hospital.
He should learn.

187
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,263
Dr. O'Malley.

188
00:07:23,807 --> 00:07:26,221
Okay, what do you have up there ?

189
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,050
Is she pregnant?

190
00:07:28,117 --> 00:07:29,373
- Oh, my god. If you're pregnant...
- No,

191
00:07:30,138 --> 00:07:30,760
I'm not pregnant.

192
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:32,990
Am I ?

193
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:35,310
No.

194
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,221
I could see the tumor.

195
00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:46,983
With my naked eye, I could see the tumor.

196
00:07:47,086 --> 00:07:49,150
I've never seen a
cervical tumor that large.

197
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:53,893
Does she have cancer ?

198
00:07:54,565 --> 00:07:57,381
It... It'll take hours to get
the biopsy results back.

199
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,382
If she has cancer,
I need you to tell me,

200
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:03,612
because if you tell me
in front of her, I'll start to cry,

201
00:08:03,635 --> 00:08:05,191
and when I cry, she cries.

202
00:08:06,115 --> 00:08:08,841
If she has family, parents,
you should call them.

203
00:08:09,078 --> 00:08:09,971
You should call them now.

204
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:13,993
It's just, her parents...
We

205
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:15,423
left home. We both 

206
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:18,270
left home when we were 16,
and we haven't been back.

207
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:19,691
We don't...

208
00:08:20,576 --> 00:08:23,210
It's just, Jilly, in situations like
these, she might change her mind.

209
00:08:28,815 --> 00:08:31,151
She might want her family.

210
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:34,243
I am her family.

211
00:08:35,486 --> 00:08:37,550
She is... my family.

212
00:08:38,627 --> 00:08:40,501
I'm not contacting her parents,

213
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:42,222
and neither are you.

214
00:08:47,475 --> 00:08:50,431
Jim,  annoying interns.
Annoying interns, Jim.

215
00:08:50,757 --> 00:08:52,551
Jim is semicomatose

216
00:08:52,677 --> 00:08:54,742
and has stage III decubitus ulcers.

217
00:08:55,615 --> 00:08:56,651
Bedsores ?

218
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:57,590
Right.

219
00:08:58,257 --> 00:08:59,641
So he's gonna need to be debrided,

220
00:08:59,976 --> 00:09:01,213
have his dressings changed

221
00:09:01,328 --> 00:09:03,561
and be repositioned every two hours.

222
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:04,602
Every two hours ?

223
00:09:04,898 --> 00:09:07,042
By the time we finish,
we'll just have to start again.

224
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,821
I'm crying on the inside.

225
00:09:09,598 --> 00:09:10,420
Can't the nurses help ?

226
00:09:10,957 --> 00:09:11,623
They could, but

227
00:09:12,228 --> 00:09:13,701
I like nurses.

228
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,403
They're helpful and smart and

229
00:09:16,798 --> 00:09:18,600
already good at their jobs.

230
00:09:18,677 --> 00:09:22,111
So as a going away gift to them,
I'm gonna let you hang with Jim

231
00:09:22,538 --> 00:09:25,953
while I go do one last
rhinoplasty at Seattle Grace.

232
00:09:26,395 --> 00:09:29,101
I do like to leave a city just a little
prettier than when I came.

233
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:34,533
Did he just say he was leaving,

234
00:09:34,627 --> 00:09:35,373
as in quitting ?

235
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:37,872
Dr. Shepherd.

236
00:09:38,297 --> 00:09:39,053
Dr. Bailey.

237
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,270
How  was your meeting with the chief ?

238
00:09:40,328 --> 00:09:42,493
Uh, that's actually what
I wanted to talk to you about.

239
00:09:42,518 --> 00:09:44,242
There's a project I'm trying
to get off the ground.

240
00:09:44,276 --> 00:09:46,093
I'd like to open a free clinic.

241
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:47,990
Why ?

242
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:48,982
Because I want to,

243
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:50,540
and I could use your support.

244
00:09:50,627 --> 00:09:54,353
Ah, see, that kind of project
requires logistical, strategic
and administrative components,

245
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:56,240
something the chief does.

246
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,753
Apparently I'm not cut out
for that kind of work.

247
00:09:58,885 --> 00:10:01,951
So... you're gonna have to
take it to somebody else.

248
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:05,660
How's George ?

249
00:10:05,877 --> 00:10:07,133
Dealing, I guess.

250
00:10:07,297 --> 00:10:08,931
Oh, well, he sure has
a voracious appetite.

251
00:10:09,338 --> 00:10:11,323
You know, some people bake, others eat.

252
00:10:11,406 --> 00:10:11,813
No, no, no

253
00:10:11,868 --> 00:10:13,800
I don't mean that appetite.
I mean the other appetite.

254
00:10:14,008 --> 00:10:15,212
Oh, okay.

255
00:10:15,738 --> 00:10:17,301
Uh, we are not friends,

256
00:10:17,507 --> 00:10:18,183
you and I.

257
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:20,540
We're not friends.
So please don't talk to me about what

258
00:10:20,885 --> 00:10:21,622
George eats.

259
00:10:21,636 --> 00:10:23,540
Okay, I was just concerned,
and I thought you'd be concerned.

260
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,611
But you know what ? Forget it.

261
00:10:24,837 --> 00:10:25,530
I don't like you.

262
00:10:26,155 --> 00:10:26,470
Oh...

263
00:10:27,175 --> 00:10:28,262
now my feelings are hurt.

264
00:10:28,947 --> 00:10:30,381
Steve beck, age 32,

265
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,970
right patellar dislocation secondary
to a fall while running a marathon.

266
00:10:34,186 --> 00:10:36,222
The paramedics told me I blacked out.

267
00:10:36,257 --> 00:10:38,250
Any theories as to how mr. Beck
here could've passed out ?

268
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:39,740
Uh, no sign of head injury.

269
00:10:39,865 --> 00:10:41,780
His B.P. Was low in the field.
80 over 60.

270
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:42,861
Athletes have low B.P.S.

271
00:10:43,888 --> 00:10:45,901
Well, in that case,
it's probably dehydration.

272
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:47,342
I drank a lot along the way.

273
00:10:47,676 --> 00:10:48,750
What else did you do today ?

274
00:10:49,476 --> 00:10:51,131
Ate a couple of protein bars,

275
00:10:51,157 --> 00:10:53,103
took a couple aspirin
for this cold I'm fighting.

276
00:10:53,135 --> 00:10:54,790
I've got another race next month...

277
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:55,432
God !

278
00:10:55,607 --> 00:10:57,082
all right, put him in a patellar brace,

279
00:10:57,118 --> 00:10:59,121
get postreduction films
and run some labs.

280
00:10:59,135 --> 00:11:00,503
Make sure he's not too dehydrated.

281
00:11:00,818 --> 00:11:04,272
And, Steve, next time you have a cold,
you might wanna skip the race.

282
00:11:04,857 --> 00:11:05,593
Never.

283
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,221
you gonna be okay with this,
working on a cancer case ?

284
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:15,852
Yeah. Why?

285
00:11:16,698 --> 00:11:17,621
Because of your dad.

286
00:11:18,168 --> 00:11:19,420
Callie ! Hey !

287
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:22,621
Hi. Uh, sorry.
Uh, busy. Izzie.

288
00:11:23,285 --> 00:11:25,143
- Is she avoiding me ? What are you...
- Maybe, I don't know.

289
00:11:25,237 --> 00:11:26,210
Um, but I'm here

290
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:27,892
if you want to talk.
I know you're sad.

291
00:11:27,968 --> 00:11:28,981
I don't want to talk about that.

292
00:11:29,277 --> 00:11:30,863
George, I'm your best friend.
I'm trying to help you.

293
00:11:30,968 --> 00:11:32,110
Why are you making this about you ?

294
00:11:32,198 --> 00:11:35,100
It's not about me.
It's about me wanting to talk about you

295
00:11:35,307 --> 00:11:37,502
needing so much sex,
your girlfriend's vagina is broken.

296
00:11:38,256 --> 00:11:38,861
Puritans.

297
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,351
- I'm not a puritan.
- Izzie.

298
00:11:41,678 --> 00:11:42,520
Look out !

299
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:55,231
Do you need some help ?

300
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,060
Pardon?

301
00:12:01,227 --> 00:12:03,233
Our daughter is here somemewhere.

302
00:12:03,698 --> 00:12:05,552
What's her name ?
We'll look her up for you.

303
00:12:06,617 --> 00:12:07,970
Jillian Miller.

304
00:12:08,565 --> 00:12:09,190
Jilly.

305
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,871
Don't worry. If this is
really something serious,

306
00:12:15,176 --> 00:12:16,673
I'll switch my shifts at the restaurant.

307
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:18,982
Maybe do nights instead of days.

308
00:12:23,228 --> 00:12:25,330
Mom ?
Dad ?

309
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,213
Hello, Jilly.

310
00:12:27,555 --> 00:12:29,820
What are... What are you doing here ?

311
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:32,983
You called her parents?
I told you not to.

312
00:12:33,057 --> 00:12:34,390
No, I didn't.

313
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,931
It's okay, Rach.

314
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:36,870
She meant well.

315
00:12:36,996 --> 00:12:37,742
*****

316
00:12:38,276 --> 00:12:39,253
*****

317
00:12:39,907 --> 00:12:41,073
*****

318
00:12:42,725 --> 00:12:44,533
They can't talk to you, remember ?

319
00:12:44,738 --> 00:12:47,380
Right. I'm shunned. You can't
give an inch, can you ?

320
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:48,592
You and these rules.

321
00:12:50,348 --> 00:12:52,772
Jilly, uh, I have your test results.

322
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:55,420
- I'm sorry. You are...
- My parents.

323
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:59,011
It is... it is cancer ?

324
00:13:00,175 --> 00:13:03,143
We'll have to perform
a radical hysterectomy.

325
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:04,833
Surgery ?

326
00:13:05,898 --> 00:13:06,690
It's okay, Rach.

327
00:13:06,815 --> 00:13:07,572
But how does...

328
00:13:08,256 --> 00:13:09,653
How did it get this bad ?

329
00:13:09,775 --> 00:13:12,401
- Jilly doesn't want you here, okay ?
- Rachel, it's okay.

330
00:13:12,435 --> 00:13:13,872
- No, it's not.
- But it's...

331
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:16,691
they are just here to make you go home
with them. Is that what you want ?

332
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:17,982
Do you want to go back there?

333
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:25,472
Mom, dad...

334
00:13:26,968 --> 00:13:28,052
You should go.

335
00:13:29,696 --> 00:13:30,911
- But you're having surgery.

336
00:13:30,956 --> 00:13:31,640
- I know, but...

337
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:33,480
You coming...

338
00:13:34,498 --> 00:13:35,512
was a mistake.

339
00:13:36,657 --> 00:13:37,400
Please go home.

340
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:50,522
You're quitting ?

341
00:13:50,768 --> 00:13:53,490
As soon as I find the Chief and
hand him my letter of resignation.

342
00:13:53,715 --> 00:13:54,290
Why ?

343
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,440
I hate it here.

344
00:13:56,796 --> 00:13:58,410
I hate the town. I hate the weather.

345
00:13:58,548 --> 00:13:59,613
I hate the people.

346
00:13:59,827 --> 00:14:00,560
They're mean.

347
00:14:01,156 --> 00:14:02,071
They're unforgiving.

348
00:14:03,526 --> 00:14:06,811
The people of Seattle are unforgiving,
or Derek and Addison ?

349
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,633
What's your point?

350
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:11,301
What about your contract ?

351
00:14:11,587 --> 00:14:13,832
My non-binding verbal
agreement with Richard ?

352
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:15,831
Yeah, I'm breaking that.

353
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:19,910
Well, it's not as if he's gonna be
around to enforce it, so...

354
00:14:20,137 --> 00:14:21,112
What do you mean ?

355
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:24,190
Well, the rumor has it 
he's stepping down.

356
00:14:24,768 --> 00:14:25,521
The Chief ?

357
00:14:27,177 --> 00:14:28,343
Well, who's gonna take his place ?

358
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:30,190
What do you care?
You're leaving anyway.

359
00:14:33,387 --> 00:14:35,773
When Richard asked you to come out here,
what did he use for bait ?

360
00:14:36,608 --> 00:14:40,931
He told me that I would have the
foremost neonatal unit west of Manhattan.

361
00:14:41,045 --> 00:14:43,123
Okay. He didn't say anything
about being Chief.

362
00:14:46,216 --> 00:14:48,063
- Why ? What do you know ?
- Nothing.

363
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:48,883
I  know what you know.

364
00:14:50,108 --> 00:14:50,780
You're lying.

365
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,542
- Dr. Montgomery.
- Uh, I'm busy now, Karev.

366
00:14:58,408 --> 00:15:01,032
When you get a minute,
I'd like to talk about the kissing.

367
00:15:06,647 --> 00:15:07,661
Who'd you piss off ?

368
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,111
- Sloan.
- Oh, nice.

369
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,252
You got anything good ?

370
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,813
Not even a fracture.

371
00:15:12,016 --> 00:15:13,673
You think a guy passes out
while running,

372
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:14,933
I'd at least get a fracture.

373
00:15:17,988 --> 00:15:21,193
Anyone available to assist me
on a truncus arteriosus surgery ?

374
00:15:21,348 --> 00:15:22,380
- Yeah.
- Yes, absolutely.

375
00:15:23,587 --> 00:15:24,092
Good,

376
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:27,883
Then the first one of you to accurately
describe the condition will scrub in.

377
00:15:30,506 --> 00:15:31,433
No one knows the answer ?

378
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:38,743
That's too bad. It'll probably be years
before we see another one like this.

379
00:15:40,188 --> 00:15:40,691
Oh, well.

380
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:44,980
It's a single arterial trunk
coming from the ventricles.

381
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:45,923
- How could you not know that ?

382
00:15:45,948 --> 00:15:46,912
- How could you not say it?

383
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,753
I'm sorry you had to find out
about that Chief thing that way.

384
00:15:58,507 --> 00:15:59,973
You mean after the fact ?

385
00:16:00,885 --> 00:16:02,222
Not the first time.

386
00:16:03,347 --> 00:16:06,552
I couldn't go to anybody about my hand.
I didn't know who I could trust.

387
00:16:08,516 --> 00:16:09,162
I was stuck.

388
00:16:09,706 --> 00:16:10,323
Yeah.

389
00:16:11,357 --> 00:16:12,450
Well, now you're not.

390
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:14,732
Hand's all better.

391
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:16,952
You can operate.
You can even run for chief.

392
00:16:17,665 --> 00:16:18,530
Life is all good again.

393
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:20,550
Well, I'm not gonna try for chief.

394
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:23,030
I'm looking for...

395
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:24,782
answers.

396
00:16:26,107 --> 00:16:27,453
Well, the chief asked you once already.

397
00:16:27,505 --> 00:16:28,651
I don't see why he wouldn't
ask you again.

398
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:31,493
Look, I couldn't take the job.
It wouldn't be...

399
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:33,033
It wouldn't be...

400
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:35,342
right.

401
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:37,040
Well, whether something's right or not.

402
00:16:37,907 --> 00:16:39,360
Doesn't seem to matter
much in this place.

403
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:46,611
Well, your labs show that
you're significantly dehydrated

404
00:16:46,635 --> 00:16:48,380
and your muscles
are breaking down a bit.

405
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,061
We just want to make sure
that the fluids help get

406
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:52,002
everything back to normal
before we send you home.

407
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:53,523
But my knee's gonna be okay, right ?

408
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:56,250
'Cause I blew this race.
I gotta win the next one.

409
00:16:56,455 --> 00:16:59,473
Your x-ray looks fine. Your knee
should be okay in about three weeks.

410
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:00,713
You might want to try some P.T.

411
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:02,072
It's pretty sore.

412
00:17:02,357 --> 00:17:03,263
The knee ?

413
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:06,521
- Yeah, my calves, too.
- Oh. Uh, well, maybe--

414
00:17:07,248 --> 00:17:09,172
Your brace is probably
a little too tight.

415
00:17:09,398 --> 00:17:11,302
You've got extreme
swelling in both legs.

416
00:17:11,568 --> 00:17:12,633
Uh, get Torres, now.

417
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:18,682
- What the hell happened ?
- He was complaining of leg pain.

418
00:17:18,855 --> 00:17:20,203
Please, can't you make it stop ?!

419
00:17:20,278 --> 00:17:22,703
- I can't find a pulse.
- All right, open a cutdown tray.

420
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:23,333
Gloves.

421
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:26,732
All right, listen, I need you to do
everything that I do exactly as I do it,
all right ?

422
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:28,470
Steve, listen to me,

423
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:32,133
this is gonna hurt, but if you want to keep
your legs, I need you to hold them still.

424
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,283
All right ? Can you do that ?

425
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:34,370
Okay,

426
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:35,713
Hold his legs.

427
00:17:36,415 --> 00:17:37,212
All right.

428
00:17:42,138 --> 00:17:42,951
Follow my lead.

429
00:17:51,668 --> 00:17:54,952
His kidneys are failing. Why in the
hell is this progressing so rapidly ?

430
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:57,111
- Damn it.
- What?

431
00:17:57,225 --> 00:17:57,900
The aspirin.

432
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,402
Because of the marathon
and the dehydration,

433
00:17:59,438 --> 00:18:02,003
His muscles are breaking down, and
the aspirin's accelerating the process.

434
00:18:02,046 --> 00:18:02,951
His whole system's crashing.

435
00:18:02,975 --> 00:18:04,331
The toxins in his body
are going to kill him.

436
00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:07,060
I need to put in a dialysis
catheter under fluoro.

437
00:18:07,155 --> 00:18:09,083
Let's get this man to an O.R.
Now, people.

438
00:18:11,147 --> 00:18:11,993
You want to go grab lunch ?

439
00:18:12,218 --> 00:18:16,091
Oh, yeah... I was actually hoping
I could grab lunch with Callie.

440
00:18:16,267 --> 00:18:17,720
- Have you seen her ?
- No, but--

441
00:18:17,788 --> 00:18:19,162
I think I'm gonna page her.

442
00:18:19,418 --> 00:18:21,083
- George.
- Izzie.

443
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,050
Look.

444
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:24,640
They're still here.

445
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:27,441
They're her family.
Where else are they gonna go ?

446
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,312
Actually, I'm gonna find Callie.

447
00:18:38,107 --> 00:18:40,462
- Dr. Montgomery.
- Now's not a good time. Karev !

448
00:18:41,198 --> 00:18:43,273
- Karev, listen to me--
- No, you listen.

449
00:18:43,937 --> 00:18:45,200
You kissed me, right ?

450
00:18:45,555 --> 00:18:47,543
You kissed me, and ever since,
you've been avoiding me.

451
00:18:47,547 --> 00:18:48,123
- Alex...

452
00:18:48,196 --> 00:18:50,993
No, you have been avoiding me
because you just assume that I want you.

453
00:18:51,236 --> 00:18:54,662
You just expect that everyone you look
at sideways is pining after you, right ?

454
00:18:54,928 --> 00:18:57,711
Has it even occurred to you that
maybe I'm not interested?

455
00:18:58,735 --> 00:18:59,941
You're not interested ?

456
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:03,490
You think I want to be just another
intern sleeping with an attending ?

457
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,940
You kissed me back.

458
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:07,931
You're my boss.

459
00:19:08,445 --> 00:19:10,051
I mean, what'd you expect me to do ?

460
00:19:11,357 --> 00:19:14,561
Look, Sloan's had me
changing bandages all day,

461
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,460
and I would way rather be scrubbing
in on one of your surgeries,

462
00:19:17,517 --> 00:19:20,083
and if you keep avoiding me,
then I don't get to scrub in.

463
00:19:20,365 --> 00:19:21,722
So stop avoiding me.

464
00:19:22,658 --> 00:19:23,690
It happened.

465
00:19:24,158 --> 00:19:25,402
But it doesn't have to happen again.

466
00:19:27,777 --> 00:19:28,413
All right.

467
00:19:29,277 --> 00:19:29,960
All right.

468
00:19:35,376 --> 00:19:36,871
Rumor has it you're headed
back to New York.

469
00:19:36,986 --> 00:19:39,131
- Where'd you hear that ?
- Good news travels fast.

470
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:42,783
Actually, I was gonna ask you to scrub in
on a peripheral nerve reconstruction but,

471
00:19:42,897 --> 00:19:45,402
- since it's your last day...
- It isn't, and I'd love to.

472
00:19:45,748 --> 00:19:48,422
- What ? But I thought...
- Well, I was going, but now I'm not.

473
00:19:48,768 --> 00:19:50,973
Rumor has it there's a race for Chief.

474
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:52,243
Where'd you hear that ?

475
00:19:52,746 --> 00:19:54,231
Good news travels fast.

476
00:19:54,646 --> 00:19:57,041
Especially when you have
a chatty girlfriend, anyway...

477
00:19:57,347 --> 00:19:58,682
See you at the finish line.

478
00:20:01,308 --> 00:20:02,382
Have you done that before ?

479
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,081
Slice a guy's legs open
while he's awake ?

480
00:20:05,257 --> 00:20:05,872
No.

481
00:20:06,948 --> 00:20:07,662
Impressive.

482
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:09,442
You, too.

483
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,092
Not that we're, uh, friends or anything.

484
00:20:16,546 --> 00:20:18,310
So you said I should be concerned...

485
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:19,471
about George.

486
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,543
He doesn't...
He doesn't talk about his dad.

487
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:25,360
We don't...
We don't talk about anything, really.

488
00:20:25,365 --> 00:20:26,971
He just... Talking's overrated.

489
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:29,910
Oh, so you and Burke still aren't, uh...

490
00:20:32,285 --> 00:20:33,343
George told me.

491
00:20:34,547 --> 00:20:35,953
Well, see, you talked about that.

492
00:20:36,255 --> 00:20:38,533
Yeah, a week ago.
If this keeps up,

493
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:41,780
you and burke might be the very
last thing we ever talk about.

494
00:20:43,235 --> 00:20:45,293
So what's the last thing
you and burke talked about ?

495
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:50,772
Silence is overrated.

496
00:20:54,488 --> 00:20:55,281
Where's Rachel ?

497
00:20:55,925 --> 00:20:57,552
She went to go make some phone calls,

498
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:58,891
try to get her shifts covered.

499
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,103
You know, Jilly, um...

500
00:21:03,018 --> 00:21:04,410
your parents are still here.

501
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:06,493
They are ?

502
00:21:07,437 --> 00:21:08,901
And I'm not the one who called them.

503
00:21:10,826 --> 00:21:11,641
Yeah.

504
00:21:13,377 --> 00:21:15,333
You called them, right ?

505
00:21:16,218 --> 00:21:19,652
And I'm guessing they had to
fly in from somewhere. So...

506
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:23,210
you called them, what,
yesterday, the day before ?

507
00:21:25,216 --> 00:21:27,131
I went to an E.R. A while ago.

508
00:21:27,716 --> 00:21:29,493
And they told me to see an oncologist.

509
00:21:30,486 --> 00:21:31,283
But...

510
00:21:31,405 --> 00:21:32,691
I couldn't afford my rent,

511
00:21:33,118 --> 00:21:34,800
let alone pay a bunch of medical bills.

512
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:36,641
But...

513
00:21:37,968 --> 00:21:39,262
Then I got scared.

514
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:41,641
You called your parents.

515
00:21:43,337 --> 00:21:44,561
I didn't know what else to do.

516
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:47,341
You sent them away because...

517
00:21:47,636 --> 00:21:49,670
Rachel's my best friend. And...

518
00:21:50,507 --> 00:21:53,382
And after she was baptized,
she decided to leave the community,

519
00:21:54,097 --> 00:21:55,461
which means she's shunned.

520
00:21:56,278 --> 00:21:57,003
But...

521
00:21:57,435 --> 00:21:59,892
I couldn't just let her go out
in the world all by herself.

522
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:01,361
So you're shunned, too ?

523
00:22:01,576 --> 00:22:02,201
No,

524
00:22:02,618 --> 00:22:04,261
because I hadn't been baptized yet.

525
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,593
So I could still go back.

526
00:22:07,738 --> 00:22:10,200
- But Rachel would never...
- Do you want to go back ?

527
00:22:12,905 --> 00:22:13,890
I think about it.

528
00:22:16,257 --> 00:22:17,263
It's my home, you know ?

529
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:20,733
And if I'm dying...

530
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:24,452
I want an amish funeral.

531
00:22:26,217 --> 00:22:27,193
I want to be...

532
00:22:28,028 --> 00:22:29,521
buried in the white dress,

533
00:22:30,146 --> 00:22:31,950
and I want everybody to be there.

534
00:22:33,528 --> 00:22:34,630
It's your home.

535
00:22:37,665 --> 00:22:38,463
But...

536
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:40,401
I made a promise to Rachel.

537
00:22:41,675 --> 00:22:42,693
Cradle to grave.

538
00:22:51,595 --> 00:22:53,242
How did Jilly let it get this far ?

539
00:22:53,577 --> 00:22:54,871
It's frustrating, isn't it?

540
00:22:55,856 --> 00:22:57,663
And it's entirely preventable.

541
00:22:57,705 --> 00:23:00,781
And treatable, if you catch it
in time, but you gotta catch it.

542
00:23:01,638 --> 00:23:04,533
Which is why I want to open a clinic.

543
00:23:04,908 --> 00:23:06,960
If she had had access to a Free Clinic,

544
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:09,260
she probably would've had
a pap smear every year and,

545
00:23:09,546 --> 00:23:13,080
wouldn't be dealing with infertility
and premature menopause,

546
00:23:13,155 --> 00:23:14,690
at the tender age of 23.

547
00:23:15,198 --> 00:23:16,393
You want to open a Free Clinic ?

548
00:23:16,726 --> 00:23:18,413
At Seattle Grace? Why?

549
00:23:18,787 --> 00:23:22,643
Illness caught early means
fewer unnecessary surgeries,

550
00:23:22,646 --> 00:23:24,860
fewer unnecessary deaths.

551
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:25,970
But I mean, why ?

552
00:23:26,627 --> 00:23:29,983
Because. And if I can get
the support that I'm looking for...

553
00:23:30,005 --> 00:23:31,272
I need suction.

554
00:23:34,836 --> 00:23:37,312
Oh, no. My god.

555
00:23:37,828 --> 00:23:38,622
What ?

556
00:23:38,736 --> 00:23:42,022
The tumor's invaded through
the cervix and into the bladder.

557
00:23:42,027 --> 00:23:44,892
Which means she is a stage IV.

558
00:23:45,495 --> 00:23:48,533
Well, we're not doing this operation
today. We've got to close her up.

559
00:23:48,897 --> 00:23:50,343
There's nothing more we can do here.

560
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:55,173
O'Malley ?

561
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:57,691
It's his dad.

562
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:22,152
How far'd he run before his body
had the good sense to pass out ?

563
00:24:22,246 --> 00:24:23,263
12 miles.

564
00:24:23,855 --> 00:24:25,353
You've got to be out of your mind.

565
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:29,253
Well, he couldn't have expected a head
cold and a couple of aspirin to do him in.

566
00:24:29,485 --> 00:24:31,483
He probably felt dizzy
miles before he passed out.

567
00:24:31,486 --> 00:24:33,630
He should've stopped,
sat his ass down.

568
00:24:33,895 --> 00:24:36,140
He was in it to win. I understand that.

569
00:24:36,295 --> 00:24:37,193
You can, can you ?

570
00:24:37,385 --> 00:24:40,213
Well, surgery is the most competitive
field in medicine. We're all here to win.

571
00:24:40,386 --> 00:24:41,703
It's a long road, Dr. Yang,

572
00:24:41,765 --> 00:24:44,372
When you get to the end of it,
you're not gonna care about winning.

573
00:24:44,578 --> 00:24:47,610
You're just gonna be relieved
that you made it to the finish line.

574
00:24:49,475 --> 00:24:50,481
You told Sloan ?

575
00:24:51,438 --> 00:24:52,622
- What?
- Mark Sloan.

576
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,523
You told him the Chief was stepping
down, that I wanted the job.

577
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:55,861
I didn't know that was a secret.

578
00:24:55,866 --> 00:24:57,592
He was leaving, Meredith.
He was leaving town.

579
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,770
- Okay, and now he's not ?
- No, he's not.

580
00:25:00,608 --> 00:25:02,132
You gave him a reason to stay.

581
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:04,602
Derek.

582
00:25:06,127 --> 00:25:08,303
The commitment I'm asking for,
is only a few hours a week.

583
00:25:08,316 --> 00:25:10,962
I'm sorry, but I can't deal with
any more distractions right now.

584
00:25:11,188 --> 00:25:11,932
You owe me.

585
00:25:14,295 --> 00:25:16,143
- What ?
- When you had that tremor,

586
00:25:16,508 --> 00:25:19,733
you cut me out of surgery after surgery
made me feel like

587
00:25:19,867 --> 00:25:21,892
I was the one who couldn't do her job.

588
00:25:22,498 --> 00:25:24,173
You made me doubt myself.

589
00:25:25,075 --> 00:25:26,271
You owe me this.

590
00:25:28,697 --> 00:25:30,593
You need someone
who can provide leadership,

591
00:25:30,718 --> 00:25:32,021
Direction to the project.

592
00:25:34,465 --> 00:25:35,462
I'm not that man.

593
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:37,170
Not anymore.

594
00:25:38,915 --> 00:25:40,282
That's what you want to believe.

595
00:25:44,935 --> 00:25:46,413
Over the next few months,

596
00:25:46,585 --> 00:25:47,952
Jilly's gonna go through a lot...

597
00:25:48,605 --> 00:25:50,342
Radiation, chimo.

598
00:25:51,148 --> 00:25:52,401
It's likely her...

599
00:25:53,205 --> 00:25:54,541
condition will get worse,

600
00:25:55,227 --> 00:25:56,132
a lot worse.

601
00:25:56,426 --> 00:25:57,913
And she's gonna need a lot of help.

602
00:25:58,067 --> 00:25:59,561
Okay, um...

603
00:25:59,786 --> 00:26:04,673
Um, well, can you give me some names
of... of doctors and medications ?

604
00:26:04,678 --> 00:26:06,123
'Cause I wanna be ready. I wanna...

605
00:26:06,256 --> 00:26:08,273
know everything so I can do this...

606
00:26:08,457 --> 00:26:09,760
Do this right for her.

607
00:26:10,017 --> 00:26:10,811
Rachel...

608
00:26:12,978 --> 00:26:13,831
You can't...

609
00:26:15,016 --> 00:26:16,850
be everything. It's too hard.

610
00:26:17,905 --> 00:26:20,060
Jilly has parents who love her. They...

611
00:26:20,737 --> 00:26:23,620
They love her, and they're here,
and she wants to go home.

612
00:26:23,758 --> 00:26:25,681
- No, she doesn't.
- She called them, not me.

613
00:26:27,476 --> 00:26:28,412
Jilly called ?

614
00:26:29,448 --> 00:26:30,592
Jilly is dying.

615
00:26:32,266 --> 00:26:33,570
But I promised her.

616
00:26:34,516 --> 00:26:36,433
Cradle to grave. She's...

617
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:38,533
Jilly, I love her.

618
00:26:39,156 --> 00:26:42,693
It's possible that The very best thing
that you can do for her if you love her,

619
00:26:43,658 --> 00:26:44,581
is let her go.

620
00:27:01,275 --> 00:27:03,442
- Are you waiting to see the Chief ?
- Yes.

621
00:27:03,925 --> 00:27:04,723
You ?

622
00:27:04,906 --> 00:27:05,701
Yeah.

623
00:27:06,287 --> 00:27:07,202
About ?

624
00:27:07,535 --> 00:27:09,330
Uh, oh, you know, just,

625
00:27:09,756 --> 00:27:10,661
admin stuff.

626
00:27:11,057 --> 00:27:12,372
Yeah, me, too.

627
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,223
- What are you doing here ?
- We're waiting to see the chief.

628
00:27:16,985 --> 00:27:19,511
- You too?
- Yes, Derek, both of us.

629
00:27:19,588 --> 00:27:20,441
You're unbelievable.

630
00:27:20,445 --> 00:27:22,372
I'm unbelievable ? The chief steps down,

631
00:27:22,386 --> 00:27:24,252
And you automatically assume
it's between you and Burke ?

632
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:25,202
You think he's gonna pick you?

633
00:27:25,295 --> 00:27:28,181
Well, I think the fact that he hasn't tapped
either one of you, yet means that he...

634
00:27:28,585 --> 00:27:30,222
he has another candidate in mind.

635
00:27:30,286 --> 00:27:32,311
What ? No one invited me to the party ?

636
00:27:33,446 --> 00:27:33,840
Chief!

637
00:27:33,955 --> 00:27:35,513
- I have an appointment !
- Chief !

638
00:27:35,518 --> 00:27:36,803
- I've been trying...
- I called Patricia.

639
00:27:36,806 --> 00:27:38,473
- I have an appointment.
- No !

640
00:27:38,476 --> 00:27:39,552
- I have an appointment.
- I... I... I

641
00:27:39,556 --> 00:27:42,313
Stop, stop, stop. stop
One at the time here.

642
00:27:43,485 --> 00:27:44,292
You.

643
00:27:44,556 --> 00:27:45,532
What's all this about ?

644
00:27:46,286 --> 00:27:47,883
They all wanna be Chief.

645
00:27:48,265 --> 00:27:50,402
And for the record, so do I

646
00:27:50,517 --> 00:27:52,462
Oh, you want to be chief
Just because we want to be.

647
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:54,071
All right, button it. All of you.

648
00:27:54,388 --> 00:27:55,442
I have had...

649
00:27:56,095 --> 00:27:57,002
A perfect day.

650
00:27:58,017 --> 00:28:01,050
I went to the board this morning
and told them I was retiring,

651
00:28:01,188 --> 00:28:02,493
I saved a life,

652
00:28:02,895 --> 00:28:05,120
and now I'm off to see my wife.

653
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:06,660
It has been a perfect day

654
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,193
until you four fools tried to ruin it.

655
00:28:09,328 --> 00:28:12,280
A man can't be happy
he's retiring around here,

656
00:28:12,836 --> 00:28:14,961
Not with you vultures
trying to pick my bones.

657
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:15,750
Chief...

658
00:28:16,806 --> 00:28:18,122
you steppin' down ?

659
00:28:21,265 --> 00:28:23,273
As soon as they find
a replacement for me,

660
00:28:23,946 --> 00:28:25,782
I'm stepping down
as chief of surgery.

661
00:28:28,287 --> 00:28:29,781
But I don't know when that'll be,

662
00:28:30,495 --> 00:28:33,270
because at this point,
I don't see any front-runners.

663
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:34,823
Excuse me.

664
00:28:35,326 --> 00:28:36,672
Chief, that's not true...

665
00:28:42,608 --> 00:28:44,893
You didn't think of maybe
tell me this morning ?

666
00:28:45,035 --> 00:28:46,342
That you were planning to step down,

667
00:28:46,457 --> 00:28:48,360
Instead of sending me
on this wild goose chase ?

668
00:28:48,538 --> 00:28:49,550
Dr. Bailey,

669
00:28:50,036 --> 00:28:52,343
you need those clowns
to sign off on your proposal

670
00:28:52,346 --> 00:28:54,810
because one of them maybe
Chief of surgery in a month.

671
00:28:56,138 --> 00:28:57,262
It's hard to imagine,

672
00:28:57,696 --> 00:29:00,533
for me more than anyone, but since
you're not ready for the job...

673
00:29:01,177 --> 00:29:03,681
One of them's gonna have to
do it for the next few years.

674
00:29:04,028 --> 00:29:04,640
Me ?

675
00:29:04,925 --> 00:29:06,282
It's you in the chair, eventually.

676
00:29:06,547 --> 00:29:07,470
That's who you are.

677
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:11,152
But you're gonna have to get
a new chair because you're short.

678
00:29:11,677 --> 00:29:12,750
You have short legs.

679
00:29:13,357 --> 00:29:15,391
But someday you are gonna be
Chief of surgery.

680
00:29:16,245 --> 00:29:18,402
I wasn't sending you
on a wild goose chase.

681
00:29:19,515 --> 00:29:22,202
I was trying to get you in the
habit of doing things without me.

682
00:29:31,265 --> 00:29:33,050
- He's really doing it.
- Mmh.

683
00:29:33,178 --> 00:29:34,693
He's really retiring.

684
00:29:36,115 --> 00:29:37,811
One of us could be Chief.

685
00:29:38,665 --> 00:29:39,322
No.

686
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:42,071
One of us could be chief. You ?

687
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:43,292
I don't think so.

688
00:29:43,486 --> 00:29:44,660
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

689
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:46,362
Oh, I could be Chief.

690
00:29:46,947 --> 00:29:47,952
You're delusional.

691
00:29:48,136 --> 00:29:52,142
Mark Sloan, Chief of surgery. That makes
me vomit a little in my mouth.

692
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:58,672
These are your letters of support,
for my Free Clinic.

693
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:01,401
- Sign them.
- Why do you want this clinic so badly ?

694
00:30:01,578 --> 00:30:02,632
You're a surgeon.

695
00:30:02,788 --> 00:30:04,492
Because I need something more.

696
00:30:04,618 --> 00:30:06,873
I know you all have your
messy love lives and your,

697
00:30:07,237 --> 00:30:09,840
secrets and your silliness,
but I want more.

698
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:13,062
I need something to hold on to.

699
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:16,793
I need a reason to believe that medicine
can do more than stitch you up,

700
00:30:16,797 --> 00:30:18,083
and... and send you away.

701
00:30:18,245 --> 00:30:20,712
I need to believe that medicine
can not only save lives,

702
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,651
but... But change lives.
I need

703
00:30:23,015 --> 00:30:24,320
I need...

704
00:30:26,855 --> 00:30:30,783
I need to believe in something
the way I used to believe in you all.

705
00:30:37,237 --> 00:30:38,242
Sign the papers.

706
00:30:41,126 --> 00:30:42,091
Sign the papers.

707
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:43,462
You still need funding.

708
00:30:57,016 --> 00:30:58,393
The nazi's back.

709
00:31:04,077 --> 00:31:04,790
Hi.

710
00:31:09,715 --> 00:31:10,592
Go home.

711
00:31:12,268 --> 00:31:13,072
Rach...

712
00:31:13,687 --> 00:31:14,963
They're your parents,

713
00:31:15,246 --> 00:31:17,830
and you love them,
and they're still here.

714
00:31:18,455 --> 00:31:21,131
You know what a big deal it is,
for them to get on a plane.

715
00:31:21,907 --> 00:31:23,033
Go home, Jilly.

716
00:31:24,095 --> 00:31:24,913
But...

717
00:31:26,026 --> 00:31:28,963
- I can't just leave you here.
- Yes, you can.

718
00:31:30,678 --> 00:31:32,990
- Rachel...
- You can go back home.

719
00:31:33,467 --> 00:31:35,073
And you can put on your bonnet,

720
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:37,150
and you can get in the buggy,

721
00:31:37,316 --> 00:31:39,743
and go to church, get baptized.

722
00:31:40,895 --> 00:31:42,261
You can die amish.

723
00:31:42,297 --> 00:31:43,773
- No, I can't do that.
- Why ?

724
00:31:44,288 --> 00:31:46,490
'Cause you'll have to shun me?
Don't worry about me.

725
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:48,683
I will be living it up here,

726
00:31:49,086 --> 00:31:51,990
with your curling iron
and your cable TV,

727
00:31:52,055 --> 00:31:54,332
and your entire dvd collection.

728
00:31:54,965 --> 00:31:57,090
I'll be okay, here in the 21st century.

729
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:03,623
I can't shun you.

730
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:04,880
You can.

731
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:08,243
And you will.
And I won't take no for an answer.

732
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:21,413
Now, say hello to your parents.

733
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:24,633
Hi.

734
00:32:27,537 --> 00:32:28,332
- Jilly.
- Hi.

735
00:32:33,026 --> 00:32:33,840
Jilly.

736
00:32:34,866 --> 00:32:35,641
Dad.

737
00:32:41,415 --> 00:32:43,963
I will tell your parents that I saw you,

738
00:32:44,336 --> 00:32:46,000
and you are well and happy,

739
00:32:47,117 --> 00:32:50,251
and have grown into a fine woman.

740
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:12,271
Richard.

741
00:33:12,775 --> 00:33:14,090
What are you doing here ?

742
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:16,162
These are for you.

743
00:33:17,935 --> 00:33:19,653
Richard, what are you doing here ?

744
00:33:20,555 --> 00:33:21,550
I did it, Adele.

745
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,460
I retired.

746
00:33:24,137 --> 00:33:26,532
And I gotta tell you,
I didn't think I wanted to do it,

747
00:33:27,546 --> 00:33:28,340
but...

748
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,020
I'm relieved.

749
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:32,090
I'm happy.

750
00:33:32,265 --> 00:33:35,043
But when I told you I didn't have
any more time to wait,

751
00:33:35,695 --> 00:33:37,282
- I meant it.
- I know you did,

752
00:33:37,285 --> 00:33:39,330
- Which is why...
- That was months ago.

753
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,162
Months ago, I said,
"you are out of time with me".

754
00:33:42,268 --> 00:33:43,110
Adele...

755
00:33:54,356 --> 00:33:55,702
is there a man in my house ?

756
00:33:58,355 --> 00:34:00,080
I'm so sorry, Richard.

757
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:05,480
But, what did you expect ?

758
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:24,741
I'm sorry.

759
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,362
Why ?

760
00:34:30,976 --> 00:34:34,303
I'm angry... What's wrong with having
a lot of sex if it makes me feel better?

761
00:34:34,478 --> 00:34:35,121
Do you...

762
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:37,992
feel better ?

763
00:34:40,796 --> 00:34:41,860
You know how you felt...

764
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:47,920
when you were lying
on the bathroom floor ?

765
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:55,893
Maybe you're not supposed
to feel better.

766
00:34:59,805 --> 00:35:00,560
Iz, you can't help me.

767
00:35:03,507 --> 00:35:04,743
I know you want to.

768
00:35:05,547 --> 00:35:06,212
But you can't.

769
00:35:10,255 --> 00:35:11,190
You can't help me.

770
00:35:12,107 --> 00:35:13,372
I have to let you go.

771
00:35:15,855 --> 00:35:16,671
Yeah.

772
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:19,551
Just one last thing.

773
00:35:29,646 --> 00:35:31,070
Life is short, George.

774
00:35:33,616 --> 00:35:34,870
Life is short,

775
00:35:35,506 --> 00:35:37,823
And it sucks a lot of the time.

776
00:35:40,248 --> 00:35:43,692
If being with Callie makes you happy,
Then go be with Callie.

777
00:36:05,646 --> 00:36:06,380
Hey,

778
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:07,653
he gonna be okay ?

779
00:36:08,605 --> 00:36:09,381
I think so.

780
00:36:12,987 --> 00:36:14,073
How's your clinic going ?

781
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,292
I got my signatures,

782
00:36:16,825 --> 00:36:18,350
Which is a start.

783
00:36:19,338 --> 00:36:22,870
The Seattle Grace
Free Clinic will exist.

784
00:36:28,475 --> 00:36:30,381
"The Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic".

785
00:36:32,305 --> 00:36:32,803
What ?

786
00:36:34,287 --> 00:36:35,771
I have $8 million.

787
00:36:38,276 --> 00:36:40,092
Izzie Stevens...

788
00:36:47,937 --> 00:36:49,040
You left without me.

789
00:36:52,118 --> 00:36:52,940
Now you're not talking to me.

790
00:36:59,018 --> 00:36:59,990
I was a jerk.

791
00:37:02,057 --> 00:37:04,751
Sometimes, boyfriends can be jerks. That
doesn't mean you stop talking to them.

792
00:37:08,315 --> 00:37:09,992
You get that I'm saying "I'm sorry",

793
00:37:10,485 --> 00:37:11,280
right ?

794
00:37:12,046 --> 00:37:14,973
You yelled at me for no reason,
and then you walked away,

795
00:37:15,487 --> 00:37:16,892
and now you show up here.

796
00:37:17,115 --> 00:37:18,023
Of course I showed up.

797
00:37:19,185 --> 00:37:20,023
Why wouldn't I ?

798
00:37:20,485 --> 00:37:21,850
- You don't trust me ?
- I do.

799
00:37:22,496 --> 00:37:24,750
Okay, well, this is how it works...
You fight sometimes,

800
00:37:25,048 --> 00:37:26,322
and somebody apologizes.

801
00:37:26,796 --> 00:37:28,010
Well, how am I supposed to know that ?

802
00:37:30,506 --> 00:37:31,801
You've never done this before.

803
00:37:33,015 --> 00:37:34,680
No, I've never done this before.

804
00:37:38,427 --> 00:37:39,671
Okay. All right.

805
00:37:40,988 --> 00:37:42,472
Well, this is...

806
00:37:45,075 --> 00:37:46,001
From now on,

807
00:37:47,115 --> 00:37:48,211
you can expect

808
00:37:49,038 --> 00:37:50,002
that I'm gonna show up,

809
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:52,541
even if I yell,

810
00:37:53,627 --> 00:37:54,573
even if you yell.

811
00:37:57,377 --> 00:37:58,560
I'm always gonna show up.

812
00:38:00,538 --> 00:38:01,333
Okay ?

813
00:38:02,436 --> 00:38:03,303
Okay.

814
00:38:15,177 --> 00:38:17,692
You are gonna make an excellent chief.

815
00:38:18,407 --> 00:38:20,513
<i>We all think we're going to be great.</i>

816
00:38:22,186 --> 00:38:23,032
Yeah.

817
00:38:24,818 --> 00:38:28,443
<i>And we feel a little bit robbed
when our expectations aren't met.</i>

818
00:38:28,916 --> 00:38:29,740
Karev.

819
00:38:30,638 --> 00:38:33,311
I've got an ovarian torsion
that needs emergent surgery.

820
00:38:33,605 --> 00:38:34,591
You want in ?

821
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:36,860
Yeah.

822
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:38,623
<i>But sometimes,</i>

823
00:38:38,905 --> 00:38:41,843
<i>our expectations sell us short.</i>

824
00:38:44,246 --> 00:38:44,970
I was right.

825
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:51,141
I swear, I really believe
what I did was right.

826
00:38:52,516 --> 00:38:54,661
I... I don't want you to forgive me.

827
00:38:55,597 --> 00:38:56,643
Frankly, I'd...

828
00:38:58,265 --> 00:39:00,630
I'd find it patronizing if you did,
because

829
00:39:01,336 --> 00:39:04,041
while I know I was right,
you think I'm wrong...

830
00:39:06,806 --> 00:39:08,000
which doesn't matter.

831
00:39:12,256 --> 00:39:13,200
Because...

832
00:39:16,428 --> 00:39:17,410
I'm in this.

833
00:39:22,097 --> 00:39:23,443
I'm in this for the long haul,

834
00:39:24,798 --> 00:39:26,750
and I'm in this to finish the race.

835
00:39:28,055 --> 00:39:30,570
So if that means I don't win this one,

836
00:39:31,778 --> 00:39:34,502
then fine, I don't win.

837
00:39:36,035 --> 00:39:36,873
You win.

838
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:39,491
I'm talking.

839
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:43,441
See ? I'm talking first. You win.

840
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:50,761
<i>Sometimes the expected, simply pales
in comparison to the unexpected.</i>

841
00:39:53,646 --> 00:39:54,443
Marry me.

842
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:01,261
I don't want to waste another minute.

843
00:40:01,268 --> 00:40:03,043
I can't have sex with you again, George.

844
00:40:03,045 --> 00:40:06,001
Okay ? I can't. I just--
I-- Enough with the sex.

845
00:40:08,797 --> 00:40:10,063
Since my dad died,

846
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:11,421
I feel like, uh...

847
00:40:12,388 --> 00:40:14,032
someone ripped out my stomach,

848
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:15,963
filled the hole with asphalt.

849
00:40:17,196 --> 00:40:19,153
And I laugh every time that I remember

850
00:40:19,705 --> 00:40:21,910
I'm never gonna talk to him again,

851
00:40:21,917 --> 00:40:24,751
because it just sounds like
the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

852
00:40:26,648 --> 00:40:27,910
I can't believe it's real.

853
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:30,160
But...

854
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,310
every time I look at you...

855
00:40:35,335 --> 00:40:36,432
I feel better.

856
00:40:38,595 --> 00:40:39,591
It shocks me.

857
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:42,161
It knocks my wind out, but it's true.

858
00:40:43,086 --> 00:40:44,262
And I don't have to have sex with you.

859
00:40:44,307 --> 00:40:47,291
I'm happy just to look at
you from across the room.

860
00:40:48,247 --> 00:40:50,673
And even that...
Anything, any piece of you...

861
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:54,360
I mean, hopefully all of you.
That'd be the best thing...

862
00:40:58,388 --> 00:40:59,470
because I love you.

863
00:41:00,116 --> 00:41:00,960
George...

864
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:13,430
Marry me.

865
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:20,333
Will you marry me ?

866
00:41:23,765 --> 00:41:25,283
Marry me, Cristina Yang.

867
00:41:27,178 --> 00:41:30,342
<i>You gotta wonder why
we cling to our expectations.</i>

868
00:41:32,055 --> 00:41:33,942
<i>Because the expected is...</i>

869
00:41:34,666 --> 00:41:36,560
<i>just what keeps us steady,</i>

870
00:41:37,686 --> 00:41:38,740
<i>standing,</i>

871
00:41:39,807 --> 00:41:40,623
<i>still.</i>

872
00:41:41,005 --> 00:41:41,892
Marry me.

873
00:41:43,796 --> 00:41:46,631
<i>The expected's just the beginning.</i>

874
00:41:51,626 --> 00:41:53,082
<i>The unexpected...</i>

875
00:41:56,587 --> 00:41:58,620
<i>is what changes our lives.</i>
