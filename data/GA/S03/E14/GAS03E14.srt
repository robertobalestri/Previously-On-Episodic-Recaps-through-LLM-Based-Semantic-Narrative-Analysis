1
00:00:00,026 --> 00:00:01,681
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,688 --> 00:00:03,679
I want Seattle Grace
to open a free clinic.

3
00:00:03,694 --> 00:00:04,034
Why ?

4
00:00:04,036 --> 00:00:06,370
I need something to hold on to.

5
00:00:06,384 --> 00:00:07,219
You still need funding.

6
00:00:07,228 --> 00:00:08,384
I have $8 million.

7
00:00:08,395 --> 00:00:10,146
The Denny Duquette memorial clinic.

8
00:00:12,065 --> 00:00:12,654
What's all this about?

9
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,853
They all want to be chief.

10
00:00:13,867 --> 00:00:14,940
She's in a nursing home

11
00:00:14,962 --> 00:00:15,688
Alzheimer's.

12
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:16,754
I gave up everything for him.

13
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:17,893
I should never have had a kid.

14
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:19,563
Marry me, Cristina Yang.

15
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:20,463
Marry me.

16
00:00:22,977 --> 00:00:27,330
As surgeons, we live in a world
of worst-case scenarios.

17
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:30,371
We cut ourselves off
from hoping for the best

18
00:00:30,528 --> 00:00:33,881
because too many times,
the best doesn't happen.

19
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:38,930
But every now and then,
something extraordinary occurs...

20
00:01:02,548 --> 00:01:04,750
and suddenly...

21
00:01:05,095 --> 00:01:08,263
best-case scenarios seem possible.

22
00:01:08,326 --> 00:01:12,860
- 8 days, $8 million...
- and we're open for business.

23
00:01:13,048 --> 00:01:17,162
And every now and then,
something amazing happens...

24
00:01:18,397 --> 00:01:20,221
She woke up this morning
completely aware.

25
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:22,060
She's her old self. It happens.

26
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,120
Medically, we don't know why.
It's just a random gift.

27
00:01:25,246 --> 00:01:26,692
So she's lucid? She remembers?

28
00:01:26,736 --> 00:01:27,562
Pretty much everything,

29
00:01:27,686 --> 00:01:30,993
except the last five years. And, of course,
she doesn't realize she has Alzheimer's.

30
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:32,951
We thought she should hear it from you.

31
00:01:33,558 --> 00:01:34,770
So she'll know me?

32
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,243
I'm gonna walk in there,
and she'll know who I am?

33
00:01:37,278 --> 00:01:38,322
She's been asking for you.

34
00:01:39,676 --> 00:01:42,081
And against our better judgment...

35
00:01:42,778 --> 00:01:44,440
We start to have hope.

36
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:47,262
Hey, chief. I need a signature.

37
00:01:47,278 --> 00:01:49,983
I'd like to use the helicopter to
transport a patient from Denver.

38
00:01:49,796 --> 00:01:50,290
Good morning, chief.

39
00:01:50,326 --> 00:01:52,091
I found a way to fund
a stereotactic robot.

40
00:01:52,106 --> 00:01:53,633
I want to make sure you're
on board before I move forward.

41
00:01:53,658 --> 00:01:56,160
It's a little early in the morning
for you two to be chasing me down.

42
00:01:56,187 --> 00:01:59,741
I'm going to be doing a bloodless pulmonary
valve translocation on this patient.

43
00:01:59,755 --> 00:02:01,980
This machine is an excellent source
of revenue for...

44
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:02,763
Aren't you gonna get in there?

45
00:02:03,145 --> 00:02:05,150
You want to be chief, you gotta fight
with the big boys.

46
00:02:05,178 --> 00:02:06,853
Oh, I intend to fight like a girl.

47
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:10,881
I'll let them kill each other, and then
I'll be the only one left standing.

48
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:12,023
And then there's me.

49
00:02:13,537 --> 00:02:15,381
There you go, underestimating me again.

50
00:02:15,397 --> 00:02:18,330
Oh, it's not that I underestimate you.
It's just that I don't think about you...

51
00:02:19,046 --> 00:02:19,562
at all.

52
00:02:21,548 --> 00:02:22,272
Well, you should.

53
00:02:24,857 --> 00:02:27,233
I was, uh, heading down to the clinic.

54
00:02:27,638 --> 00:02:28,972
It's opening today, and I

55
00:02:29,577 --> 00:02:32,071
thought it might be nice to show
Dr. Bailey a little support.

56
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:33,383
Very thoughtful, Dr. Sloan.

57
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:35,450
I think I'll join you.

58
00:02:35,936 --> 00:02:37,203
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me.

59
00:02:37,515 --> 00:02:38,003
Certainly.

60
00:02:39,745 --> 00:02:40,203
Nicely done.

61
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:40,943
Mm-hmm.

62
00:02:42,068 --> 00:02:43,921
Meredith, what is going on?

63
00:02:43,965 --> 00:02:44,930
When did you get back from Europe?

64
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:46,943
I went to Europe for two months,

65
00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:47,890
but that was...

66
00:02:47,907 --> 00:02:50,132
I've been sitting here thinking
about the fight we had,

67
00:02:50,155 --> 00:02:50,731
the things I said.

68
00:02:50,748 --> 00:02:52,560
I... I said some terrible things.

69
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:53,053
It's fine.

70
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:54,142
No, it's not.

71
00:02:54,188 --> 00:02:55,812
After you left, I... I was upset.

72
00:02:57,435 --> 00:02:58,631
Did I... did I have a breakdown?

73
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:01,770
I must have had a nervous breakdown.
I'm in a... is it a hospital?

74
00:03:02,286 --> 00:03:05,433
Because I can't remember anything
for the past two months, Meredith.

75
00:03:05,487 --> 00:03:07,170
The last thing I remember
is the fight we had.

76
00:03:07,206 --> 00:03:09,870
And listen, if you don't want to
go to medical school, that is fine.

77
00:03:09,895 --> 00:03:11,423
It is your life. Just take me home.

78
00:03:11,436 --> 00:03:12,472
I went to medical school.

79
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:13,492
I... I want to go home, Meredith.

80
00:03:13,657 --> 00:03:14,631
I... I need to go home.

81
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:17,272
You are home.

82
00:03:18,785 --> 00:03:20,810
I  went to Europe five years ago.

83
00:03:21,646 --> 00:03:22,680
You got sick.

84
00:03:23,457 --> 00:03:24,761
You have Alzheimer's.

85
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:27,372
This is your home.

86
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:29,812
You live here now.

87
00:03:34,108 --> 00:03:34,462
No.

88
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:36,043
No!

89
00:03:36,876 --> 00:03:37,362
Mom.

90
00:03:37,838 --> 00:03:38,721
No!

91
00:03:41,545 --> 00:03:42,223
Mom?

92
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:43,131
Mom?

93
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:45,693
Mom! Somebody call 9-1-1.

94
00:03:51,777 --> 00:03:53,661
- She had substernal chest...
- Chest pain and syncope.

95
00:03:53,727 --> 00:03:56,780
My pulse was in the 200s, but the
rate has resolved on its own.

96
00:03:57,555 --> 00:03:58,651
She's completely lucid.

97
00:03:59,078 --> 00:03:59,570
She's what?

98
00:04:00,555 --> 00:04:01,290
She's aware.

99
00:04:01,357 --> 00:04:02,403
She's herself again.

100
00:04:02,638 --> 00:04:03,921
Oh, my god. Is this...

101
00:04:04,368 --> 00:04:05,541
Are we at Seattle Grace?

102
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:07,492
Yes, mom. This is where
I'm doing my residency.

103
00:04:07,507 --> 00:04:09,553
Your daughter is one of
our finest interns,

104
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:11,880
following in your very big footsteps.

105
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:13,211
Do you know Richard Webber?

106
00:04:13,256 --> 00:04:14,432
Is he still a doctor here?

107
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:15,631
What, the chief?

108
00:04:16,455 --> 00:04:17,940
Richard Webber is the chief?

109
00:04:18,197 --> 00:04:19,042
Of surgery?

110
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:22,931
Okay, welcome to the
Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic.

111
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:26,601
Barring any surgical emergencies,
you will be working here today.

112
00:04:28,158 --> 00:04:29,320
Working on what?

113
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:30,101
Right now,

114
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:34,482
Olivia will be familiarizing you with
the protocol for the flu vaccine.

115
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:37,111
Oh, no, no, no. Don't... don't...
don't touch that.

116
00:04:37,185 --> 00:04:39,240
That was $79.

117
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:41,660
Oh, my god.

118
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:43,571
I have got to get out of here. 

119
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,322
Burke has a bloodless
pulmonary valve translocation

120
00:04:46,376 --> 00:04:47,792
fly in from Denver tomorrow.

121
00:04:47,836 --> 00:04:48,832
I should be preparing.

122
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,861
You don't get to scrub in
on the valve translocation.

123
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:51,751
How do you know?

124
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:52,312
Because I am.

125
00:04:53,317 --> 00:04:54,091
He picked you?

126
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:54,733
You guys ready?

127
00:04:55,018 --> 00:04:55,671
Where is everybody?

128
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:57,901
Uh,  Grey will be late.

129
00:04:57,927 --> 00:04:59,791
O'Malley should be back from vacation.

130
00:04:59,807 --> 00:05:00,841
No, no, no, the patients...

131
00:05:01,406 --> 00:05:04,300
the underserved, uninsured population
that we're supposed to be helping.

132
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,840
The underserved uninsured will come.

133
00:05:06,868 --> 00:05:08,773
You'll see. Just watch the door.

134
00:05:08,816 --> 00:05:09,882
They will come through it.

135
00:05:09,895 --> 00:05:11,383
I can't wait for the first patient.

136
00:05:11,418 --> 00:05:12,161
It's gonna be amazing.

137
00:05:12,197 --> 00:05:14,103
It's gonna be amazing what
Denny's money can do, right?

138
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:17,941
Just watch the doors, Stevens.

139
00:05:29,408 --> 00:05:30,220
Dr. Bailey,

140
00:05:30,518 --> 00:05:32,902
congratulations on the
opening of the clinic.

141
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,621
It is open, isn't it?

142
00:05:38,147 --> 00:05:39,801
Is Stevens all right?

143
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:41,060
She's watching the door, sir.

144
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:43,518
Okay then.

145
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:50,124
Someone's coming.

146
00:05:51,846 --> 00:05:52,653
Damn it!

147
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,560
O'Malley, welcome back. You're late.

148
00:06:00,685 --> 00:06:01,802
Is O'Malley all right?

149
00:06:03,336 --> 00:06:05,182
We got married in Vegas!

150
00:06:10,628 --> 00:06:11,440
We're married!

151
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:17,790
Dude, she... she's Callie O'Malley.

152
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:31,010
It's... it's fast.

153
00:06:31,126 --> 00:06:34,120
You know, it seems really very fast.

154
00:06:34,876 --> 00:06:36,202
Are...are you even happy ?

155
00:06:36,285 --> 00:06:37,481
We're incredibly happy.

156
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:38,931
Oh, yay. Well, great.

157
00:06:39,075 --> 00:06:39,841
Yay.

158
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:41,641
Show her the ring.

159
00:06:41,677 --> 00:06:41,933
Oh.

160
00:06:42,787 --> 00:06:43,961
Oh.

161
00:06:44,107 --> 00:06:45,351
That's so great.

162
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:48,251
Tiny diamonds are great because you know
no one will every try to steal it.

163
00:06:50,907 --> 00:06:51,451
Oh.

164
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:53,760
Okay, that's it.

165
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:55,632
Yang, Burke needs you in cardio.

166
00:06:55,645 --> 00:06:58,712
O'Malley, the chief has a surgical
patient coming into the pit.

167
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:01,283
Stevens, Karev, go find me
some patients.

168
00:07:01,305 --> 00:07:02,881
I don't care where you get them,
just get them.

169
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,681
Congratulations.

170
00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:06,121
Thank you.

171
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:06,761
Thanks.

172
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:10,563
Okay, we've been out of our Vegas hotel
room bubble for six hours,

173
00:07:10,578 --> 00:07:11,122
and I don't like it.

174
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:12,023
It's gonna be fine.

175
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:12,730
We're married.

176
00:07:14,557 --> 00:07:15,933
We're married.

177
00:07:17,597 --> 00:07:18,033
All right.

178
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:21,942
So, chief,

179
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,692
we're a couple of married men.

180
00:07:24,385 --> 00:07:24,951
Uh,

181
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:27,463
Adele and I are getting a divorce.

182
00:07:27,586 --> 00:07:27,990
No...

183
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:29,760
um...

184
00:07:30,727 --> 00:07:31,962
I didn't... I didn't know.

185
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:34,072
That's life, O'Malley.

186
00:07:35,015 --> 00:07:36,011
That's  life.

187
00:07:37,477 --> 00:07:38,891
Now this patient...

188
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:42,150
I removed a large tumor from her colon
eight months ago.

189
00:07:42,168 --> 00:07:44,642
Since then, she's been undergoing
chemo and radiation.

190
00:07:45,347 --> 00:07:46,711
We thought she had it beat.

191
00:07:46,915 --> 00:07:47,491
Excuse me.

192
00:07:48,547 --> 00:07:50,721
Are you the doctors for Marina Wagner?

193
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:51,682
Yes. You brought her in?

194
00:07:51,695 --> 00:07:53,302
I woke up this morning,
she was barely breathing.

195
00:07:53,315 --> 00:07:54,481
You think this could be food poisoning?

196
00:07:54,497 --> 00:07:56,673
Cause we had sushi yesterday,
but I... I feel fine.

197
00:07:56,848 --> 00:07:58,473
Could be complications from the radiation.

198
00:07:58,988 --> 00:07:59,901
What do you mean, radiation?

199
00:07:59,956 --> 00:08:01,080
From her cancer treatment.

200
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:02,172
She doesn't have cancer.

201
00:08:03,005 --> 00:08:04,152
I'm her boyfriend. I'd know.

202
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:11,421
O'Malley, get a C.B.C., A chem 19 and
a triple contrast abdominal C.T.

203
00:08:11,655 --> 00:08:12,242
Excuse me.

204
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:12,681
Yes, sir.

205
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:16,383
Wait. 

206
00:08:16,826 --> 00:08:17,421
Is she all right?

207
00:08:17,537 --> 00:08:18,842
She's... Richard Webber.

208
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:20,842
My god, you've aged.

209
00:08:21,798 --> 00:08:22,130
Ellis.

210
00:08:22,146 --> 00:08:23,623
I was having arrhythmias.

211
00:08:24,506 --> 00:08:25,611
They wanted to do tests.

212
00:08:25,626 --> 00:08:28,573
And I hear you're the chief
of surgery now.

213
00:08:28,778 --> 00:08:29,500
That's wonderful.

214
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:30,890
Yes,  I'm...

215
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:33,783
but I'm stepping down soon.

216
00:08:33,797 --> 00:08:34,413
Stepping down?

217
00:08:35,337 --> 00:08:36,982
Well, I can only assume
that was Adele's idea.

218
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:40,192
Meredith.

219
00:08:40,915 --> 00:08:42,053
I'll be right there, mom.

220
00:08:42,326 --> 00:08:42,712
Go ahead.

221
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,071
She's lucid.

222
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,061
She woke up this morning
with her memory back.

223
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:53,811
They say it's temporary.

224
00:08:55,926 --> 00:08:56,850
My god.

225
00:08:57,255 --> 00:08:59,822
Well, obviously, don't...
don't worry about work today.

226
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:01,012
You need to be with her.

227
00:09:01,447 --> 00:09:02,542
I mean, this time...

228
00:09:04,737 --> 00:09:05,631
it's a gift.

229
00:09:06,598 --> 00:09:07,642
It's a gift.

230
00:09:08,406 --> 00:09:08,930
Right.

231
00:09:15,976 --> 00:09:19,402
Meredith's mother had some runs of
S.V.T. I'm ordering an echo.

232
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,493
And she's lucid.

233
00:09:21,997 --> 00:09:22,471
What?

234
00:09:22,648 --> 00:09:24,591
It happens, but it won't last.

235
00:09:24,616 --> 00:09:25,643
I...is Meredith okay?

236
00:09:25,668 --> 00:09:28,473
She seems fine, but her mother's going
to need the best care we have to offer.

237
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:29,683
And  you, dr. Yang,

238
00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:31,220
are the best.

239
00:09:36,148 --> 00:09:37,380
You're still not wearing the ring.

240
00:09:37,415 --> 00:09:39,133
I would like an answer.
It's been over a week.

241
00:09:39,318 --> 00:09:40,152
I told you,

242
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:41,593
it's under advisement.

243
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:43,322
Well, do you not like the ring?

244
00:09:43,818 --> 00:09:44,721
It's a ring.

245
00:09:44,886 --> 00:09:47,652
It's 3-carat, diamond-cut platinum...

246
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,942
it's... it's the ring.

247
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:49,501
Then what?

248
00:09:53,195 --> 00:09:56,591
Are you using the surgery tomorrow to
pressure me into giving you an answer?

249
00:09:56,616 --> 00:09:57,922
Is that why I'm not scrubbing in?

250
00:09:58,288 --> 00:10:00,062
I need to give the other
interns a chance.

251
00:10:00,086 --> 00:10:00,552
Why?

252
00:10:01,285 --> 00:10:03,512
The echo, please, Dr. Yang.

253
00:10:10,036 --> 00:10:10,802
- Hey.
- Hi.

254
00:10:12,037 --> 00:10:13,143
You been waiting long?

255
00:10:13,476 --> 00:10:14,411
Almost an hour.

256
00:10:14,436 --> 00:10:14,880
Mm.

257
00:10:14,986 --> 00:10:15,473
Mm.

258
00:10:16,036 --> 00:10:16,743
Are you my doctor?

259
00:10:16,756 --> 00:10:17,481
I can be.

260
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:19,480
We have a clinic right
outside those doors.

261
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:19,951
So wait.

262
00:10:19,976 --> 00:10:20,442
What's wrong?

263
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:24,383
It hurts when I pee.

264
00:10:24,418 --> 00:10:24,932
Oh.

265
00:10:26,038 --> 00:10:26,991
We can help with that.

266
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:27,881
Yeah, that's easy.

267
00:10:27,907 --> 00:10:28,443
It's nothing.

268
00:10:28,475 --> 00:10:30,073
We can have you out of here
in less than an hour.

269
00:10:32,117 --> 00:10:33,433
Are you hitting on me?

270
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:35,701
we need patients.

271
00:10:35,897 --> 00:10:38,062
You need doctors.
And we just happen to be surgeons.

272
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:39,820
You think I need surgery?

273
00:10:40,236 --> 00:10:41,110
You never know.

274
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:42,592
It's free.

275
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:44,031
A free clinic.

276
00:10:44,238 --> 00:10:45,801
My co-pay is only 10 bucks.

277
00:10:45,955 --> 00:10:46,731
That's lunch.

278
00:10:51,387 --> 00:10:52,463
sounds like T.B.

279
00:10:52,477 --> 00:10:52,832
Yeah

280
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:54,593
Very contagious.

281
00:11:02,806 --> 00:11:04,222
You and Meredith are good friends.

282
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:07,301
I can tell...

283
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:09,871
Because you're afraid to look at me...

284
00:11:11,556 --> 00:11:14,160
as if I might ask you some personal
question about her,

285
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:15,663
and you'll accidentally slip.

286
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,242
But you don't do anything
accidentally, do you?

287
00:11:25,346 --> 00:11:26,751
Has Meredith chosen a specialty?

288
00:11:27,265 --> 00:11:29,532
That's a personal question.

289
00:11:29,568 --> 00:11:31,702
For a surgeon, it's the most personal
question you can ask.

290
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:32,893
It tells you who they are.

291
00:11:33,545 --> 00:11:35,931
My mother would want to know
whether I had a boyfriend.

292
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:38,100
Your mother sounds like
a frivolous woman.

293
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:44,743
If I chose cardiothoracics,
what would that say about me?

294
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:46,620
Heart surgeons are the know-it-alls.

295
00:11:46,717 --> 00:11:48,353
They're the most ambitious,
the most driven.

296
00:11:48,476 --> 00:11:49,870
They want it all, and they want it now.

297
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,750
And they don't want anything
getting in their way.

298
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:58,692
Meredith says I'm part of
an Alzheimer's research study.

299
00:11:59,596 --> 00:12:00,882
I want a neuro consult

300
00:12:00,996 --> 00:12:02,720
with the doctor who put me in the trial.

301
00:12:04,968 --> 00:12:06,372
Hey, Mer.

302
00:12:06,585 --> 00:12:07,542
I've been looking for you.

303
00:12:07,597 --> 00:12:08,701
Burke has me on your mom.

304
00:12:08,737 --> 00:12:09,532
Are you okay?

305
00:12:09,556 --> 00:12:10,432
I'm avoiding her.

306
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:11,853
I'm avoiding the gift.

307
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:14,203
Yeah, well, uh, your gift
wants to meet Derek.

308
00:12:14,305 --> 00:12:15,500
What? What did you say?

309
00:12:15,547 --> 00:12:17,141
Oh, no, no, no, not Derek,
your boyfriend.

310
00:12:17,147 --> 00:12:18,633
Dr. Shepherd, the neurosurgeon.

311
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:20,350
But she's gonna know that
he's your boyfriend anyway.

312
00:12:20,368 --> 00:12:21,290
She has ways.

313
00:12:21,768 --> 00:12:22,692
I'm kind of in love with her,
by the way.

314
00:12:22,705 --> 00:12:24,901
She has that affect on people
who aren't her daughter.

315
00:12:25,937 --> 00:12:27,592
Hey, I heard about your mother.

316
00:12:27,737 --> 00:12:28,551
That's unbelievable.

317
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:29,600
Yeah, it's a gift.

318
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:30,322
She's avoiding her.

319
00:12:30,368 --> 00:12:32,563
Mer, she's your mother,
and she's really here.

320
00:12:32,576 --> 00:12:34,133
This is your chance.
You should talk to her.

321
00:12:34,156 --> 00:12:35,413
You should spend some time with her.

322
00:12:35,435 --> 00:12:38,193
She has a very long history
of being disappointed in me.

323
00:12:38,197 --> 00:12:38,950
You're a doctor now.

324
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,843
Parental disappointment ends
with a medical degree.

325
00:12:41,346 --> 00:12:42,273
Can we get moving?

326
00:12:42,675 --> 00:12:43,573
It hurts when I pee.

327
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:46,463
Are you stealing patients from the E.R.?

328
00:12:47,508 --> 00:12:48,991
Yes, but only because I have to know

329
00:12:49,046 --> 00:12:52,460
that I didn't spend my entire inheritance
on an empty room with empty beds.

330
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:53,471
Because if I did that,

331
00:12:53,516 --> 00:12:55,862
I might go crazy, and George called dibs
on all the crazy this week.

332
00:12:55,897 --> 00:12:57,201
Do you think Callie's pregnant?

333
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,190
I'm going back to the E.R.

334
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,581
Okay, just keep your pants on.

335
00:12:59,618 --> 00:13:01,533
We're going. We're going.
What...what...what's going on?

336
00:13:01,588 --> 00:13:02,243
Oh, yeah.

337
00:13:02,668 --> 00:13:03,571
Bambi got married.

338
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:06,603
Psst.

339
00:13:07,598 --> 00:13:08,520
I'm sorry. One second.

340
00:13:10,216 --> 00:13:11,010
Everything okay?

341
00:13:11,315 --> 00:13:12,052
Are...are you off today?

342
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:12,760
You got married?

343
00:13:14,118 --> 00:13:14,700
Yeah,

344
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:16,332
I did.

345
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:18,461
It was a... I know it was impulsive.

346
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:20,993
Well, was it "good" impulsive,
or was it "Meredith" impulsive?

347
00:13:21,077 --> 00:13:24,060
Because if it was Meredith impulsive,
maybe I can help get you out of it.

348
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:24,860
No.

349
00:13:25,395 --> 00:13:26,273
no, it was a...

350
00:13:26,526 --> 00:13:27,212
it's a good thing.

351
00:13:27,457 --> 00:13:27,771
Good.

352
00:13:27,797 --> 00:13:28,380
It's good.

353
00:13:28,428 --> 00:13:29,712
Um, but, uh,

354
00:13:30,896 --> 00:13:31,712
thanks for the backup.

355
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:32,702
You're welcome. 

356
00:13:33,276 --> 00:13:34,592
Congratulations, Georges.

357
00:13:36,268 --> 00:13:36,751
Thank you.

358
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:42,743
Are you planning on coming
to talk to me anytime soon?

359
00:14:00,037 --> 00:14:01,161
Excuse me.

360
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:07,261
Uh, you know those cartoons where there's
a bear or whatever and it's starving,

361
00:14:07,275 --> 00:14:11,082
and it looks at a table, and the table
turns into this delicious cooked turkey,

362
00:14:11,096 --> 00:14:13,793
with, like, lines of
deliciousness coming off it?

363
00:14:13,807 --> 00:14:18,120
I  was not looking at him like that,
because he is the help,

364
00:14:18,146 --> 00:14:20,253
and I am not going to be
sleeping with the help.

365
00:14:21,056 --> 00:14:21,841
I married the help.

366
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:23,512
What?

367
00:14:23,546 --> 00:14:24,543
We went to Vegas.

368
00:14:24,808 --> 00:14:25,423
My idea.

369
00:14:25,668 --> 00:14:26,492
I embrace the trashy.

370
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:27,151
That's...

371
00:14:27,776 --> 00:14:29,591
not that I'm not happy for you,

372
00:14:29,627 --> 00:14:32,030
But why married so... fast?

373
00:14:32,058 --> 00:14:34,603
You know those cartoons where there's
a bear and it's starving,

374
00:14:34,765 --> 00:14:36,141
and it looks at a cute intern?

375
00:14:37,205 --> 00:14:37,781
Well...

376
00:14:38,867 --> 00:14:39,811
Congratulations.

377
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:40,693
Thank you.

378
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,753
Oh, it's small.

379
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:45,922
I know, it's small.

380
00:14:45,945 --> 00:14:47,281
It's beautiful.

381
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:48,091
You think so?

382
00:14:48,385 --> 00:14:48,902
Yes.

383
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:50,471
Yes.

384
00:14:50,998 --> 00:14:52,361
So tell me about yourself.

385
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:56,303
Well...

386
00:15:00,307 --> 00:15:01,270
What's your life like?

387
00:15:02,608 --> 00:15:02,951
I...

388
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,722
really do want to know you, Meredith.

389
00:15:07,788 --> 00:15:08,851
Well, I have a boyfriend.

390
00:15:08,897 --> 00:15:10,593
Does he understand the demands of
your career?

391
00:15:10,636 --> 00:15:13,030
Because not all men do. They
say they do upfront, but they...

392
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:13,731
He's great.

393
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,760
He's a doctor, too, so he gets it.

394
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:16,170
Good.

395
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:17,552
He's actually...

396
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:18,570
have you chosen a specialty?

397
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:20,602
No, it's still early.

398
00:15:20,647 --> 00:15:22,710
Cristina's already chosen cardiothacics.

399
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,220
Yeah.

400
00:15:23,646 --> 00:15:24,960
Well, I guess I'm...

401
00:15:25,785 --> 00:15:27,603
Just waiting to be inspired.

402
00:15:27,808 --> 00:15:30,593
I'm happy now.
You know, I feel like I know who I am.

403
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,963
Plus, I think when you have someone
in your life that you love...

404
00:15:32,985 --> 00:15:34,600
you really love... I think that's...

405
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:36,832
I don't know. I just...

406
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,233
I'm really happy.

407
00:15:42,736 --> 00:15:43,322
What happened to you?

408
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:44,750
What do you mean?

409
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:45,282
You're happy?

410
00:15:45,638 --> 00:15:46,451
You're happy now?

411
00:15:47,496 --> 00:15:51,052
The Meredith I knew was a force of
nature, passionate, focused, a fighter.

412
00:15:51,148 --> 00:15:51,792
What happed to you?

413
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:52,922
You've gone soft.

414
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:54,341
Stammering about a boyfriend and...

415
00:15:54,365 --> 00:15:55,800
and saying that you're waiting
to be inspired?

416
00:15:55,816 --> 00:15:56,780
You're waiting for inspiration?

417
00:15:56,798 --> 00:15:57,752
Are you kidding me?

418
00:15:58,086 --> 00:15:59,751
I have a disease for which there
is no cure.

419
00:15:59,768 --> 00:16:01,642
I think that would be
inspiration enough.

420
00:16:01,686 --> 00:16:03,002
Listen to me, Meredith,

421
00:16:03,818 --> 00:16:07,332
anyone can fall in love
and be blindly happy,

422
00:16:07,408 --> 00:16:10,692
but not everyone can pick up a scalpel
and save a life.

423
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:14,002
I raised you to be an extraordinary
human being.

424
00:16:14,157 --> 00:16:16,831
So imagine my disappointment
when I wake up after five years

425
00:16:16,838 --> 00:16:19,390
and discover that you're
no more than ordinary.

426
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,281
What happened to you?!

427
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:28,641
We are living in the same building so

428
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:30,773
I'd see her in the laundry room and uh

429
00:16:32,178 --> 00:16:33,973
She's really sexy when she
folds clothes.

430
00:16:33,987 --> 00:16:35,662
Once we started dating, it was
just like, boom, you know?

431
00:16:35,717 --> 00:16:37,081
We got really serious really fast.

432
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,321
Now I'm just kinda like...

433
00:16:39,238 --> 00:16:40,663
I don't even know her middle name.

434
00:16:41,065 --> 00:16:43,412
I'm trying to fill out these forms, and
I'm stumped on the first question.

435
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:45,002
Rose.

436
00:16:47,336 --> 00:16:48,032
That's her middle name.

437
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:49,622
Rose.

438
00:16:55,257 --> 00:16:58,523
She's charming, she's fabulous, and then
suddenly, she's the enemy.

439
00:16:58,546 --> 00:16:59,380
I'm meeting the enemy?

440
00:16:59,408 --> 00:17:00,810
Just don't get personal.

441
00:17:00,826 --> 00:17:01,520
You're being ridiculous.

442
00:17:01,546 --> 00:17:03,422
I am not being ridiculous.

443
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:04,133
Okay. It's gonna be fine.

444
00:17:04,145 --> 00:17:05,751
Just be careful. She has ways.

445
00:17:08,238 --> 00:17:09,202
- Hey, George.
- Hey

446
00:17:09,217 --> 00:17:10,053
Are you okay?

447
00:17:10,245 --> 00:17:10,681
Yeah.

448
00:17:10,877 --> 00:17:14,512
You seem kin shaky
and sweaty and pale.

449
00:17:14,977 --> 00:17:16,573
Is it the marriage?
Are you totally regretting it?

450
00:17:16,588 --> 00:17:17,381
No, the marriage is fine.

451
00:17:17,398 --> 00:17:19,540
Uh, do you mind, uh, taking that to, uh

452
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:22,971
sorry, taking the blood work
to the lab for me?

453
00:17:22,986 --> 00:17:23,630
Sure.

454
00:17:24,118 --> 00:17:24,592
Thanks.

455
00:17:25,097 --> 00:17:26,190
I think I need to sit down.

456
00:17:26,397 --> 00:17:27,981
George, if you need to talk...

457
00:17:28,977 --> 00:17:29,572
Thanks.

458
00:17:31,588 --> 00:17:31,962
Hey.

459
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:33,262
Are you okay?

460
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:34,042
You're sweating.

461
00:17:34,075 --> 00:17:34,771
Yeah, I'm good.

462
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,342
What's your...what's your middle name?

463
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:36,842
It's bad.

464
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:37,671
I don't tell anyone.

465
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:38,700
Come on. We're married,

466
00:17:38,747 --> 00:17:40,590
and I don't even know your middle name.

467
00:17:43,315 --> 00:17:44,373
Okay, I knew it.

468
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:45,660
It's your weird and judgy friends.

469
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:46,831
You let them get to you.

470
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:49,772
No, it's... I don't... I don't know...

471
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:52,923
your middle name. God, I can... I can...
I can barely breathe.

472
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,510
You know what? You didn't know
my middle name last week,

473
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:55,993
and you could breathe just fine.

474
00:17:57,017 --> 00:17:57,630
What?

475
00:17:57,717 --> 00:18:00,411
What about a functional M.R.I.
Now, while I'm lucid?

476
00:18:00,528 --> 00:18:00,872
Mm.

477
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:04,471
An M.R.I.'s not gonna show
us anything new.

478
00:18:05,448 --> 00:18:07,762
No test is gonna help us understand
what's going on.

479
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:11,203
So in five years, you've made
no advances,

480
00:18:11,225 --> 00:18:14,183
and there is nothing else
you can do for me.

481
00:18:14,785 --> 00:18:15,690
I don't know how you do it,

482
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:19,002
day in and day out, work with people
with this awful disease.

483
00:18:19,435 --> 00:18:21,341
Oh, I... well, see...

484
00:18:21,956 --> 00:18:24,123
actually, I'm not an Alzheimer's
specialist.

485
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:28,161
I just took a special interest
in this case

486
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:29,742
because of Meredith.

487
00:18:32,286 --> 00:18:33,170
You're what happened to her.

488
00:18:33,248 --> 00:18:34,500
- I'm sorry?
- I thought you were here for me,

489
00:18:34,766 --> 00:18:35,781
to offer me some hope,

490
00:18:35,996 --> 00:18:37,171
to tell me about some new treatment.

491
00:18:37,186 --> 00:18:38,002
But you're here for her.

492
00:18:38,015 --> 00:18:38,493
Dr. Grey...

493
00:18:38,586 --> 00:18:40,123
an attending? A neurosurgeon?

494
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:41,250
No wonder she's so unfocused.

495
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:42,090
I don't think you understand.

496
00:18:42,117 --> 00:18:42,772
- I'm...
- Oh, I understand.

497
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:43,911
I understand perfectly.

498
00:18:43,927 --> 00:18:45,040
I've seen men like you before,

499
00:18:45,186 --> 00:18:46,770
threatened by a woman who's their equal.

500
00:18:46,868 --> 00:18:48,612
You just want someone to admire you.

501
00:18:49,365 --> 00:18:52,233
And you don't care about the damage
you do to her along the way.

502
00:18:55,087 --> 00:18:56,170
I need to lie down.

503
00:18:56,698 --> 00:19:00,431
Whoa. No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey, Buster,
do you know how much it costs

504
00:19:00,447 --> 00:19:02,212
to have these linens laundered?

505
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,972
I'm sick. I'm shaky and sweaty
and my mouth is dry

506
00:19:06,027 --> 00:19:06,991
and my body aches.

507
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:08,051
Fine.

508
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:11,080
Uh, Karev, replace O'Malley in the O.R.

509
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:12,170
Yes.

510
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:15,971
So this is Marina Wagner,
your colon cancer patient?

511
00:19:15,976 --> 00:19:17,193
Karev, where the hell's OMalley?

512
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:18,562
Curled up in a ball in the clinic.

513
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:19,161
Is he okay?

514
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:20,501
Well, he's married.

515
00:19:20,878 --> 00:19:21,322
Right.

516
00:19:22,277 --> 00:19:22,781
Okay,

517
00:19:23,186 --> 00:19:24,122
boki, 10-blade.

518
00:19:30,396 --> 00:19:34,550
Stolen, nonemergent E.R. Cases
and sick hospital staff...

519
00:19:34,565 --> 00:19:36,492
this is what $8 million buys you.

520
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,553
Dr. Stevens, I swear on my life,

521
00:19:38,587 --> 00:19:40,770
if I hear you say "$8 million"
on more time...

522
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:41,612
It's not about the money.

523
00:19:41,635 --> 00:19:41,952
It's...

524
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:44,633
It's Denny.

525
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:46,403
It's his legacy. It's...

526
00:19:47,328 --> 00:19:48,351
I was looking for meaning.

527
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,822
This was supposed to be meaningful.

528
00:19:49,846 --> 00:19:51,103
It will be meaningful.

529
00:19:51,105 --> 00:19:52,563
$8 million worth?

530
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:56,192
Uh, excuse me. Are... are you, uh,

531
00:19:56,548 --> 00:19:58,680
can I...are...are you the doctors?

532
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,302
Yes, we are.

533
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:00,281
Are you a patient?

534
00:20:00,728 --> 00:20:02,610
Like an actual free-clinic patient?

535
00:20:02,628 --> 00:20:04,680
Not me. My... my daughter.

536
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,913
Oh, is your daughter sick?

537
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:06,812
I'm not sick.

538
00:20:07,177 --> 00:20:08,252
Can we please go?

539
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:13,512
Kelley finds suddenly she has a need
for these products.

540
00:20:13,527 --> 00:20:18,670
And, uh, and we were hoping you might
show her how to use them.

541
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:28,270
George, you're married.

542
00:20:28,466 --> 00:20:30,350
You should be happy.
You don't look happy.

543
00:20:30,377 --> 00:20:31,702
I'm sick, Olivia.

544
00:20:32,176 --> 00:20:33,391
All right, you could...

545
00:20:33,475 --> 00:20:34,740
uh, you should go home, O'Malley.

546
00:20:34,825 --> 00:20:36,642
Clearly whatever you have is contagious.

547
00:20:38,648 --> 00:20:39,553
Aren't you from the lab?

548
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:41,070
Yeah, I feel like crap.

549
00:20:41,146 --> 00:20:43,521
Is that the lady you gave,
uh, Marina's blood to?

550
00:20:43,657 --> 00:20:45,231
Uh, yeah.

551
00:20:45,255 --> 00:20:46,841
And you all feel shaky and nauseous?

552
00:20:46,906 --> 00:20:47,692
It's awful.

553
00:20:49,785 --> 00:20:50,861
She's toxic.

554
00:20:50,908 --> 00:20:51,620
Callie? Yeah.

555
00:20:51,686 --> 00:20:52,693
A lot of us feel that way.

556
00:20:52,705 --> 00:20:54,333
No, the patient's blood is toxic.

557
00:20:54,418 --> 00:20:55,333
It's making us sick.

558
00:20:56,008 --> 00:20:58,521
Has the chief started, uh,
Marina's operation?

559
00:20:58,547 --> 00:21:00,940
They were wheeling her up
as I came down.

560
00:21:01,337 --> 00:21:02,820
What's the extension for O.R. One?

561
00:21:13,727 --> 00:21:16,432
The patient's blood is apparently highly
toxic. Any contact is dangerous.

562
00:21:16,448 --> 00:21:18,732
Nobody goes in there until we figure
out what the hell is going on.

563
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:19,473
How's he doing?

564
00:21:20,138 --> 00:21:22,532
He's tachypneic, but his B.P.
Is starting to stabilize.

565
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:23,672
He's doing better on oxygen.

566
00:21:23,686 --> 00:21:25,390
It's a good thing he got
out of there when he did.

567
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:26,253
- Yeah.
- Dr. Shepherd.

568
00:21:26,288 --> 00:21:27,403
- What is it?
- Can you sign this?

569
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:28,930
I just heard. How can I help?

570
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:30,130
You're off duty.
You should be with your mother.

571
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,490
I don't want to spend time
with my mother.

572
00:21:31,506 --> 00:21:33,551
The chief is down. Alex is down.
I would like to help.

573
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:34,170
Dr. Grey...

574
00:21:34,965 --> 00:21:36,102
you want to help?
Talk to your resident.

575
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,102
What do you got?

576
00:21:40,187 --> 00:21:42,223
They found an herbal supplement
in her purse.

577
00:21:42,227 --> 00:21:44,963
The lab guys think it combined
with the chemo chemicals

578
00:21:44,977 --> 00:21:46,883
and turned her blood into some
kind of neurotoxin.

579
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,161
We're lucky they're not all dead.

580
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:50,011
The only reason she's alive
is because she's intubated.

581
00:21:50,048 --> 00:21:50,860
Who got them out of there?

582
00:21:50,868 --> 00:21:51,441
O'Malley.

583
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:54,383
George.

584
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,163
Callie, she was toxic.

585
00:21:56,217 --> 00:21:58,811
Her blood was toxic, not our marriage.

586
00:21:58,868 --> 00:22:00,011
You thought our marriage was toxic?

587
00:22:00,907 --> 00:22:02,632
Okay, all our people are being treated.

588
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:03,880
Now what do we do about her?

589
00:22:09,805 --> 00:22:10,442
Dr. Grey,

590
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:15,131
your holter monitor shows you're having
multiple runs of tachycardia every hour,

591
00:22:15,157 --> 00:22:17,283
so Dr. Burke would like
to do a radioablation.

592
00:22:17,338 --> 00:22:20,181
Why would he recommend surgery when
medication can keep it under control?

593
00:22:23,988 --> 00:22:26,662
Because Alzheimer's patients aren't
always compliant with their meds.

594
00:22:26,716 --> 00:22:29,691
And apparently, Meredith says...

595
00:22:30,885 --> 00:22:32,481
you are particularly difficult.

596
00:22:36,415 --> 00:22:38,121
I could elect not to treat it at all.

597
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,950
Your stress test shows coronary
artery disease.

598
00:22:41,285 --> 00:22:42,870
That coupled with the tachyarrhythmia

599
00:22:42,885 --> 00:22:44,653
could cause too much stress on your
heart, which would

600
00:22:45,857 --> 00:22:46,771
eventually...

601
00:22:52,575 --> 00:22:53,451
what would you do

602
00:22:54,537 --> 00:22:57,332
if the thing that defines who you are

603
00:22:58,976 --> 00:22:59,841
was taken away?

604
00:23:05,905 --> 00:23:06,920
Tell Dr. Burke...

605
00:23:10,006 --> 00:23:11,271
I don't want the surgery.

606
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:12,112
I'm...

607
00:23:12,816 --> 00:23:16,033
I'm s... I'm very sorry, Dr. Grey,
but technically, that

608
00:23:16,656 --> 00:23:18,123
decision isn't yours.

609
00:23:18,696 --> 00:23:19,533
It's Meredith's.

610
00:23:21,705 --> 00:23:23,941
This is a maxi pad... heavy flow day.

611
00:23:23,977 --> 00:23:27,951
Mini pad... pretty self-explanatory...
just peel the label and stick it.

612
00:23:28,395 --> 00:23:29,890
And the tampon we've already gone over.
So

613
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:31,742
are we clear on everything?

614
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:35,290
Kelley...

615
00:23:36,315 --> 00:23:37,103
I understand

616
00:23:37,227 --> 00:23:39,552
that you're a little mortified that your
dad dragged you in here,

617
00:23:39,565 --> 00:23:42,542
but can you just talk or nod
or something?

618
00:23:42,676 --> 00:23:43,821
I get it, okay?

619
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:46,411
How's it going with our very
first patient?

620
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,473
Kelley's a woman.

621
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:50,512
Can I just go to the gallery and learn
something, if that's okay with you?

622
00:23:50,728 --> 00:23:51,223
Okay.

623
00:23:56,588 --> 00:23:59,821
Uh, Mr. Hanson, if you could go to the
front desk and fill out some paperwork,

624
00:23:59,865 --> 00:24:00,540
 I can get you outta here.

625
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:04,072
Of course, of course.
Uh... thank you.

626
00:24:04,346 --> 00:24:09,501
Since my wife died, I... I've been in
the woods a little with Kelley.

627
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:10,600
Okay.

628
00:24:10,705 --> 00:24:11,020
Yeah.

629
00:24:15,255 --> 00:24:18,020
Are you okay, Kelley? Any cramps?
'Cause a heating pad...

630
00:24:18,035 --> 00:24:19,651
Could I be pregnant if I had sex last
week ? 

631
00:24:19,698 --> 00:24:22,001
Like, before the period thing started?
'Cause I did,

632
00:24:22,108 --> 00:24:26,543
and it would really suck if I was pregnant
'cause now the guy's being a real jerk,
and he's totally ignoring me at school.

633
00:24:27,495 --> 00:24:30,423
So I really hope I can't be pregnant.
I can't, right?

634
00:24:33,837 --> 00:24:36,282
Any way you could, like, answer me
before my dad gets back?

635
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:40,340
I'm not sure refusing treatment
is what you want to do.

636
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:44,010
Apparently what I want doesn't matter.
It isn't even legally binding.

637
00:24:44,976 --> 00:24:47,613
So it's really about what you want,
Meredith. You're in charge.

638
00:24:47,646 --> 00:24:50,372
You think I like making
these decisions for you?

639
00:24:50,535 --> 00:24:52,941
Do you think it's fun to get
calls from the nursing home

640
00:24:52,998 --> 00:24:55,222
asking whether I was planning
on giving the nurse

641
00:24:55,306 --> 00:24:57,631
who changes you every morning
a Christmas tip?

642
00:24:57,886 --> 00:25:02,430
But I do it, because you have managed
to alienate everybody else in your life.

643
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:04,751
And I am the only one,

644
00:25:05,277 --> 00:25:07,033
so I have to step up and do it.

645
00:25:08,606 --> 00:25:11,420
You want to know why I'm so unfocused,

646
00:25:12,756 --> 00:25:13,940
so ordinary?

647
00:25:15,417 --> 00:25:17,000
You want to know what happened to me?

648
00:25:17,146 --> 00:25:19,040
You. You happened to me.

649
00:25:19,065 --> 00:25:20,911
- Then let me refuse the heart surgery.
- No.

650
00:25:21,028 --> 00:25:22,933
- Why not?
- Because killing my mother

651
00:25:23,728 --> 00:25:26,351
is not gonna be another thing
that happens to me.

652
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:32,811
These suits are airtight.

653
00:25:32,837 --> 00:25:35,330
These packs recirculate the air
trapped inside.

654
00:25:35,995 --> 00:25:37,510
These batteries haven't been
charging long.

655
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:40,470
I'm guessing you got about 30 minutes
before they die and you have to come out.

656
00:25:40,645 --> 00:25:43,093
Oh, my god. The anesthesia's
wearing off. She's waking up.

657
00:25:44,595 --> 00:25:45,953
30 minutes starting now.

658
00:25:45,967 --> 00:25:47,232
She's fighting intubation.

659
00:25:47,248 --> 00:25:49,342
We go inside before
these seals are secure,

660
00:25:49,478 --> 00:25:51,260
we wouldn't last five minutes,
and she will die.

661
00:25:51,308 --> 00:25:52,580
These guys are two minutes out.

662
00:25:52,746 --> 00:25:54,603
- She doesn't have two minutes.
- Addison!

663
00:26:03,445 --> 00:26:04,532
Get the hell outta there!

664
00:26:04,547 --> 00:26:07,200
She's awake, Mark. She's awake
and open on the table.

665
00:26:07,217 --> 00:26:09,720
I need to know her weight so I can
dose her with the propofol.

666
00:26:09,976 --> 00:26:12,013
She looks about 60 kilos.

667
00:26:14,935 --> 00:26:15,661
you're okay.

668
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:17,572
It's okay.

669
00:26:18,236 --> 00:26:18,712
Got it.

670
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:26,471
I got you. I got you. It's okay.

671
00:26:38,057 --> 00:26:39,183
Looks like S.V.T.

672
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:41,930
Push 10 of adenosine
and page Dr. Burke.

673
00:26:41,948 --> 00:26:44,122
He's already gone into surgery.
I'll get the adenosine.

674
00:26:46,076 --> 00:26:48,431
Carotid massage.
Carotid massage.

675
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:53,093
Carotid massage can reboot the heart
and stop the S.V.T. Okay, okay, hold on.

676
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:56,103
Oh, hold on, please. Hold on, please.

677
00:27:01,488 --> 00:27:03,092
Hold on. Hold on.

678
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:05,941
Okay.

679
00:27:06,836 --> 00:27:08,410
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

680
00:27:08,476 --> 00:27:08,810
oh.

681
00:27:23,585 --> 00:27:24,211
You're good.

682
00:27:25,095 --> 00:27:26,393
Sharp under pressure.

683
00:27:27,347 --> 00:27:28,981
You'll make an extraordinary surgeon.

684
00:27:38,628 --> 00:27:40,682
Dr. Grey, I need to ask you...

685
00:27:42,336 --> 00:27:43,501
will it get in my way?

686
00:27:45,057 --> 00:27:46,131
Can I have both?

687
00:27:46,668 --> 00:27:48,683
Can I be a great surgeon
and have a life?

688
00:27:48,716 --> 00:27:51,202
Because there is this man
who just asked me to marry him,

689
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,682
and I know you tried to have both,

690
00:27:52,826 --> 00:27:54,381
but you split up with
Meredith's dad and...

691
00:27:56,068 --> 00:27:59,221
- I know this is none of my business.
- It is none of your business.

692
00:28:06,487 --> 00:28:07,922
And I didn't try hard enough.

693
00:28:11,498 --> 00:28:12,143
Thank you.

694
00:28:23,955 --> 00:28:24,892
Are you feeling better?

695
00:28:25,847 --> 00:28:28,902
Oh, I will be once my patient's
off the table.

696
00:28:29,527 --> 00:28:30,213
Look at these two...

697
00:28:31,028 --> 00:28:34,751
a heart surgeon and a neurosurgeon
performing a bowel resection.

698
00:28:34,967 --> 00:28:36,520
You think the world stops when you stop,

699
00:28:37,608 --> 00:28:38,793
but it keeps on going.

700
00:28:42,745 --> 00:28:45,173
People perform your surgeries
better than you could.

701
00:28:45,498 --> 00:28:47,372
The next generation comes up, and

702
00:28:48,446 --> 00:28:49,991
you're scared you'll be forgotten.

703
00:28:53,555 --> 00:28:55,141
Your mother stopped for five years,

704
00:28:56,217 --> 00:28:57,440
and you became someone.

705
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,092
According to her, I didn't.

706
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,872
According to her, I'm a disappointment.

707
00:29:04,145 --> 00:29:07,251
Well, in a perfect world she'd be able
to tell you she was proud of you.

708
00:29:07,557 --> 00:29:08,803
But it's not a perfect world,

709
00:29:11,138 --> 00:29:12,673
and your mother's not a perfect woman.

710
00:29:18,087 --> 00:29:20,982
I think the person she'd most like to
see right now is you.

711
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:30,063
The only thing your mother wants to hear
from me is that I regret staying with Adele.

712
00:29:31,048 --> 00:29:32,662
That's the only gift I could give her.

713
00:29:34,655 --> 00:29:35,662
And I can't tell her that.

714
00:29:38,048 --> 00:29:38,732
That's not true.

715
00:29:54,685 --> 00:29:55,871
They won't fit.

716
00:29:58,837 --> 00:29:59,813
Stop right there.

717
00:30:00,385 --> 00:30:02,190
The bowel swelled.
You won't have any room.

718
00:30:02,527 --> 00:30:04,541
- How much time do you have?
- Eight minutes.

719
00:30:06,047 --> 00:30:06,420
Okay,

720
00:30:07,325 --> 00:30:08,290
now listen to me

721
00:30:08,716 --> 00:30:10,002
and do everything I say.

722
00:30:10,298 --> 00:30:14,443
Kelley, your pregnancy test is negative,
and you're clean for S.T.D.S.

723
00:30:14,485 --> 00:30:15,502
- Oh, thank god.
- Great.

724
00:30:15,776 --> 00:30:17,570
Thanks to you, I'm also grounded
for the rest of my life.

725
00:30:18,038 --> 00:30:19,002
Kelley, be polite.

726
00:30:19,128 --> 00:30:22,550
I'm sorry, Sir, but polite doesn't seem
to be getting you two very far.

727
00:30:25,305 --> 00:30:28,830
Kelley, your dad told me you lost your
mother a few years ago,

728
00:30:29,008 --> 00:30:33,903
and I want to say how sorry I am. You
probably have a million of questions.

729
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:35,252
And if your mother were here,

730
00:30:35,296 --> 00:30:38,753
I'm sure she would have more eloquent
answers than I do.

731
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:42,243
But I think that she and I would
actually be saying the same thing,

732
00:30:42,327 --> 00:30:46,603
which is if you keep going
the way you're going,

733
00:30:46,966 --> 00:30:51,123
you will get an S.T.D.,
You will get pregnant,

734
00:30:51,238 --> 00:30:55,040
you will increase your chances
of getting cervical cancer.

735
00:30:57,087 --> 00:30:58,321
You're not being smart.

736
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:02,662
And you're too young for anyone to
expect you to be smart

737
00:31:02,768 --> 00:31:06,083
the way you need to be
when you're having sex,

738
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,533
which means you shouldn't be having it.

739
00:31:11,606 --> 00:31:13,621
I thought he liked me.

740
00:31:13,888 --> 00:31:17,100
Oh. Oh, honey, I know you did.

741
00:31:19,388 --> 00:31:20,653
I know you did.

742
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:36,130
okay, you're gonna live.

743
00:31:36,697 --> 00:31:37,640
Callie, wait.

744
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,082
I was a little bit heroic in there.

745
00:31:40,445 --> 00:31:40,772
Mm.

746
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:42,421
I thought you'd be proud of me.

747
00:31:42,456 --> 00:31:45,383
Proud? You were poisoned, and you
thought it was about me.

748
00:31:45,387 --> 00:31:47,861
- It felt like an anxiety attack.
- About me.

749
00:31:48,315 --> 00:31:53,453
You see, we...we were fine when we
were in our Vegas bubble, when it was
just room service and pay cable and us,

750
00:31:53,517 --> 00:31:56,852
it was bliss, but then you get around
your weird and judgy friends for one day

751
00:31:56,987 --> 00:32:00,641
and suddenly you're racked with
uncertainty, toxic-gas-level uncertainty.

752
00:32:01,165 --> 00:32:03,231
I guess it was too much to hope
you'd just stand up for me.

753
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,231
- Cal
- and middle name is Iphegenia.

754
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:07,013
Okay?

755
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:09,700
I can't wait to hear what your pals
have to say about that.

756
00:32:24,495 --> 00:32:27,632
So that was pretty cool, what you just
did. Going in and putting her back under.

757
00:32:27,665 --> 00:32:29,311
Cool or stupid...

758
00:32:30,436 --> 00:32:31,202
Take your pick.

759
00:32:33,015 --> 00:32:33,542
Huh.

760
00:32:37,496 --> 00:32:38,203
Okay.

761
00:32:38,446 --> 00:32:39,730
All right. I gotta...

762
00:32:41,395 --> 00:32:42,003
go.

763
00:32:48,838 --> 00:32:49,443
What's going on?

764
00:32:49,745 --> 00:32:53,460
The chief figured out the anesthesiologist
didn't have time to drop an N.G. Tube.

765
00:32:53,577 --> 00:32:55,851
So now they have to place one
and decompress

766
00:32:55,898 --> 00:32:57,933
and repack her intestines and close.

767
00:32:57,975 --> 00:32:59,940
And they're about to run out of air.

768
00:33:01,117 --> 00:33:01,763
Holy crap.

769
00:33:02,656 --> 00:33:04,290
This so beats tampon training.

770
00:33:04,518 --> 00:33:08,403
Preston, you'll need to milk the bowel
to get out the excess fluid.

771
00:33:09,015 --> 00:33:11,301
Pack her and wrap her and get
her stable for transport.

772
00:33:11,535 --> 00:33:13,510
- How's Georges?
- Medically he's fine.

773
00:33:13,636 --> 00:33:15,593
Emotionally? He's a little
stunted if you ask me.

774
00:33:15,606 --> 00:33:17,960
You don't marry the rebound girl.
Am I right?

775
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,411
You don't marry anyone on a whim.

776
00:33:19,435 --> 00:33:21,803
- Well, he needs our support.
- He doesn't need us.

777
00:33:22,005 --> 00:33:23,531
He's got his Vegas show-wife.

778
00:33:23,908 --> 00:33:24,202
Oh.

779
00:33:24,668 --> 00:33:27,183
Chief, they're at 32 minutes.
You gotta pull'em out.

780
00:33:28,026 --> 00:33:29,070
How you doin' on air?

781
00:33:34,428 --> 00:33:35,752
- I'm out.
- You go.

782
00:33:36,965 --> 00:33:38,380
- I'll wrap it.
- Alone?

783
00:33:40,296 --> 00:33:41,030
You can't.

784
00:33:44,265 --> 00:33:44,753
Burke?

785
00:33:45,575 --> 00:33:45,811
Burke!

786
00:33:47,365 --> 00:33:47,971
Burke.

787
00:33:49,517 --> 00:33:50,003
Burke.

788
00:34:01,977 --> 00:34:02,860
That's not good.

789
00:34:07,177 --> 00:34:08,231
Okay, damage control.

790
00:34:08,268 --> 00:34:12,051
We still have to pack her and wrap her
so that she's stable for transport.

791
00:34:12,107 --> 00:34:13,080
We work in shifts...

792
00:34:13,137 --> 00:34:16,151
one doctor at a time, no one stays in
for more than 20 seconds.

793
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:17,903
Dr. Sloan, do you want to go first?

794
00:34:17,935 --> 00:34:18,931
I'm not going in there.

795
00:34:19,946 --> 00:34:20,370
What?

796
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:23,780
It would be irresponsible for the
remaining healthy attending

797
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:26,102
to expose himself to the neurotoxin,

798
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:30,493
a neurotoxin whose long-term effects we're
still unaware of. So I'm staying in here.

799
00:34:34,795 --> 00:34:37,061
I can swim 3 lengths of my
parents pool underwater.

800
00:34:37,937 --> 00:34:38,753
You're up, Dr. Yang.

801
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:40,812
All right, let's get her a mask.

802
00:34:42,818 --> 00:34:44,202
Sloan, give her the lap pads.

803
00:34:44,955 --> 00:34:47,092
You're gonna wet them
and pack the cavity.

804
00:34:51,488 --> 00:34:53,232
If you feel faint, get out.

805
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:56,683
Come on Yang. Hurry.

806
00:35:02,598 --> 00:35:04,833
- I... oh, I... I've packed the wound.
- Dr Stevens.

807
00:35:05,138 --> 00:35:06,952
I couldn't get...
I couldn't wrap it.

808
00:35:07,045 --> 00:35:10,841
Remove the drape and secure the plastic
along her sides. It's gotta be tight.

809
00:35:19,136 --> 00:35:19,910
Hurry.

810
00:35:21,835 --> 00:35:23,111
Come on, Stevens.

811
00:35:23,536 --> 00:35:24,131
Come on.

812
00:35:31,705 --> 00:35:34,511
I couldn't, um...
it...it it...it twisted.

813
00:35:34,537 --> 00:35:37,563
Okay, the seal needs to be as close to
vacuum-tight as possible.

814
00:35:37,626 --> 00:35:40,203
It'll inflate, and then
you'll know it's secure.

815
00:35:46,826 --> 00:35:48,541
Come on, Grey.

816
00:35:49,475 --> 00:35:50,451
Come on.

817
00:36:02,865 --> 00:36:03,911
Is she still toxic?

818
00:36:04,335 --> 00:36:05,762
She's on C.R.R.T.

819
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:08,553
It's type of dialysis to remove
the toxin from the blood.

820
00:36:09,425 --> 00:36:10,883
You should be able to go in
in a few hours.

821
00:36:26,577 --> 00:36:27,413
You woke up.

822
00:36:28,048 --> 00:36:28,890
You're gonna be okay.

823
00:36:30,316 --> 00:36:33,571
I was hoping you'd never have to know
about any of this.

824
00:36:33,895 --> 00:36:37,210
I thought all the bad stuff in my life
was over when I met you.

825
00:36:37,998 --> 00:36:38,600
It is...

826
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:41,632
Marina Rose.

827
00:36:43,616 --> 00:36:44,743
That's my name.

828
00:36:47,135 --> 00:36:48,523
Heroic work, all of you.

829
00:36:49,278 --> 00:36:49,861
Heroic.

830
00:36:50,248 --> 00:36:52,421
Dr. Sloan, let's check
on our patient now.

831
00:36:57,436 --> 00:37:00,072
How come we do all the work
and he gets all the glory?

832
00:37:00,665 --> 00:37:01,892
Because he's Mark.

833
00:37:09,656 --> 00:37:10,700
I'm sorry I left.

834
00:37:11,386 --> 00:37:12,611
I... It was...

835
00:37:15,405 --> 00:37:17,553
I got to do damage control
on the toxic woman.

836
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:18,871
Good for you.

837
00:37:21,027 --> 00:37:22,183
Did you ever get any patients?

838
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:23,760
Just that one.

839
00:37:27,566 --> 00:37:30,032
$8-million worth of one.

840
00:37:32,737 --> 00:37:33,832
Lock up for me.

841
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,051
I heard you're having surgery tomorrow.

842
00:37:50,817 --> 00:37:51,490
Do you...

843
00:37:55,437 --> 00:37:56,680
Do I know who Meredith is?

844
00:37:56,965 --> 00:37:58,823
Do I at least recognize Meredith?

845
00:37:59,138 --> 00:38:00,913
You know she's someone important,

846
00:38:02,696 --> 00:38:03,940
someone who loves you.

847
00:38:04,717 --> 00:38:05,603
You'll look out for her?

848
00:38:07,587 --> 00:38:10,391
Because she's got so much more to learn,
and I won't be able to teach her.

849
00:38:10,595 --> 00:38:11,472
I'll look out for her.

850
00:38:13,256 --> 00:38:14,313
I wish I could go back.

851
00:38:17,048 --> 00:38:18,511
I'd do everything so differently.

852
00:38:19,036 --> 00:38:20,163
I'd fight harder for you.

853
00:38:21,238 --> 00:38:21,871
I think it...

854
00:38:22,406 --> 00:38:24,361
If I'd fought harder for you, maybe...

855
00:38:34,225 --> 00:38:36,840
We would've had a wonderful life
together, Ellis.

856
00:38:37,805 --> 00:38:39,072
- You think so?
- I do.

857
00:38:40,266 --> 00:38:42,081
We would've done our fellowship here,

858
00:38:43,706 --> 00:38:45,841
and then you would've fought me for
chief, and probably won.

859
00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:48,011
And...

860
00:38:49,176 --> 00:38:50,291
I wouldn't have minded

861
00:38:51,428 --> 00:38:52,810
because we'd have the kids at home.

862
00:38:54,568 --> 00:38:55,341
We have kids?

863
00:38:56,215 --> 00:38:58,151
Meredith would've needed
a brother and sister.

864
00:39:00,896 --> 00:39:02,150
Kids need family.

865
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:03,610
We would've been a family.

866
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:07,101
Probably bought that big house on
Parker. The one with the barn?

867
00:39:08,088 --> 00:39:09,703
Yeah, that's a good place for a family.

868
00:39:12,368 --> 00:39:14,000
And I would've been happy,

869
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,171
Just like Meredith says she's happy.

870
00:39:18,235 --> 00:39:19,140
And that would've...

871
00:39:20,998 --> 00:39:22,053
Changed everything.

872
00:39:23,848 --> 00:39:24,463
Maybe...

873
00:39:26,508 --> 00:39:28,800
I would be fine, and we could
grow old together.

874
00:39:30,778 --> 00:39:33,850
and life would be so perfectly ordinary.

875
00:39:37,715 --> 00:39:38,161
Yes.

876
00:39:46,777 --> 00:39:48,312
My life is so unfinished.

877
00:39:48,646 --> 00:39:52,313
It's unfinished, and I'm not finished.

878
00:39:53,645 --> 00:39:54,353
No. No, Ellis.

879
00:39:56,865 --> 00:39:57,893
Don't think that.

880
00:39:58,496 --> 00:39:59,880
Just close your eyes...

881
00:40:01,258 --> 00:40:02,822
And think of the family,

882
00:40:04,515 --> 00:40:05,830
of the house...

883
00:40:06,867 --> 00:40:09,032
and you there every night
to come home to.

884
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:13,230
And me there.

885
00:40:16,646 --> 00:40:17,240
I'm there.

886
00:40:25,178 --> 00:40:28,022
I am super scrubbed.
I'm minus my epidermis.

887
00:40:28,137 --> 00:40:30,890
- I still feel all fumey.
- Oh.

888
00:40:31,677 --> 00:40:32,320
Hey.

889
00:40:32,387 --> 00:40:34,240
it's the little woman.

890
00:40:34,366 --> 00:40:36,262
So what are your plans now?

891
00:40:36,615 --> 00:40:37,571
You're not moving in, are you?

892
00:40:40,467 --> 00:40:41,042
Nice.

893
00:40:43,876 --> 00:40:45,652
- Wait, Callie.
- Forget it. Just...
- No.

894
00:40:46,838 --> 00:40:47,900
Unbelievable.

895
00:40:48,137 --> 00:40:51,400
You people... you're supposed to be
my friends... my closest friends.

896
00:40:52,308 --> 00:40:55,072
Callie's a big... she's the most
important part of my life now.

897
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:58,200
If you want to drive her away... and
you're masters at it... you'll do it,

898
00:40:58,535 --> 00:41:00,103
but if she's gone, I'm gone.

899
00:41:00,556 --> 00:41:01,812
She's my wife.

900
00:41:02,495 --> 00:41:05,000
Calliope Iphegenia Torres is my wife.

901
00:41:09,085 --> 00:41:11,152
- Ipheg...
- Don't you dare.
- Okay

902
00:41:13,747 --> 00:41:17,661
As doctors, we're trained to give
our patients just the facts.

903
00:41:17,695 --> 00:41:20,292
But what our patients
really want to know is,

904
00:41:20,587 --> 00:41:24,302
Will the pain ever go away?
Will I feel better?

905
00:41:24,407 --> 00:41:25,400
Am I cured?

906
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,103
I thought you said you didn't
think about me.

907
00:41:28,206 --> 00:41:29,080
I don't.

908
00:41:29,898 --> 00:41:35,270
I am actively not thinking about you...
Right...

909
00:41:37,226 --> 00:41:38,122
Now.

910
00:41:39,418 --> 00:41:44,021
What our patients really want to
know is... Is there hope?

911
00:41:49,845 --> 00:41:51,051
I don't do rings.

912
00:42:00,955 --> 00:42:02,730
Don't expect me to suddenly change.

913
00:42:03,668 --> 00:42:06,070
I'm a surgeon, just like you.

914
00:42:07,418 --> 00:42:08,672
And we'll have money.

915
00:42:08,975 --> 00:42:10,031
We can hire a wife.

916
00:42:14,457 --> 00:42:16,100
Are you saying yes?

917
00:42:18,108 --> 00:42:18,670
Yeah.

918
00:42:21,485 --> 00:42:24,020
- I'm not letting you scrub in tomorrow.
- Well, I'm not wearing a ring.

919
00:42:24,087 --> 00:42:25,051
- Okay.
- Okay, then.

920
00:42:27,085 --> 00:42:28,003
Yes!

921
00:42:29,127 --> 00:42:31,683
oh! Okay, okay, okay, okay!

922
00:42:32,075 --> 00:42:35,790
But inevitably, there are times
when you find yourself

923
00:42:36,065 --> 00:42:37,960
In the worst-case scenario...

924
00:42:40,215 --> 00:42:43,202
- Meredith...
- I just have to say this...

925
00:42:44,606 --> 00:42:46,821
the reason I want you to have
the surgery 

926
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:49,341
is because I have this hope

927
00:42:50,088 --> 00:42:53,021
that in a year or two years or five,

928
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:54,290
They're gonna have a breakthrough

929
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,243
They're gonna find a cure for Alzeihmers

930
00:42:57,868 --> 00:42:59,943
and you and I will have another chance

931
00:43:00,638 --> 00:43:01,732
to get to know each other

932
00:43:03,115 --> 00:43:04,310
You'll have a chance

933
00:43:04,787 --> 00:43:05,751
to get to know me

934
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:06,873
to see

935
00:43:07,636 --> 00:43:10,911
that I am not even remotely ordinary

936
00:43:12,598 --> 00:43:19,583
So, I wish you would have the surgery.
But it's up to you mom. It's your life!

937
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:30,850
You remind me of my daughter

938
00:43:38,025 --> 00:43:39,563
About an hour ago

939
00:43:40,607 --> 00:43:43,031
One minute she was here, the next...

940
00:43:44,615 --> 00:43:45,751
I'm so sorry

941
00:43:48,246 --> 00:43:49,653
Me too

942
00:43:53,918 --> 00:43:56,743
When the patient's body
has betrayed them

943
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:00,881
And all the science we have to offer
has failed them.

944
00:44:01,317 --> 00:44:03,602
When the worst-case scenario comes true.

945
00:44:04,165 --> 00:44:05,091
Clinging to hope

946
00:44:06,096 --> 00:44:07,330
is all we've got left.
