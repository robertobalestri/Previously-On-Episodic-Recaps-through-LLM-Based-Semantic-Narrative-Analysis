1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Previously  on "grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,560
you and red make a pretty good team.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,770
- Don't tell sloan.
- Oh,she and sloanaren't happening.

4
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,370
- I'm not what you're looking for.
- What are you talking about?

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,180
Once a man-whore,always
a man-whore,right?

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,990
I keep telling her there's more
to life than surgery and career.

7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,540
Mother. it has to be small.

8
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,370
Make an appointment at city
hall,and that'll be that.

9
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,070
I don't know if I wanna keep
trying to breathe for you.

10
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,810
I'll go.

11
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,640
He said he spent the day in the clinic when he
spent it doing god knows what with izzie stevens.

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,180
You're gonna transfer to mercy west?

13
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,930
I mean,no offense. Today was awesome.
It's just you're not my girlfriend.

14
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,510
Okay?

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,450
the dream
is this--

16
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,590
that we'll finally be happy
when we reach our goals.

17
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,590
Find the guy,finish
our internship--

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,190
that's the dream.

19
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,700
Then we get there.

20
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,510
And if we're human,

21
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,230
we immediately start
dreaming  of something else.

22
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,730
It's 3:00 in the morning.
What are you doing up?

23
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,580
What are you doing up?

24
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,240
- I can't sleep.
- What are we watching?

25
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,620
- Why can't you sleep?
- No reason.

26
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,920
Because if this is the dream...

27
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,060
then we'd like to wake up...

28
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,550
now,please.

29
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,100
okay.

30
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,530
Cristina,stop lurking.

31
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,980
Come and say good
morning to your guests.

32
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,440
Good morning,mother.

33
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,860
Uh,good morning,missus...

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,210
mama.

35
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,620
What...

36
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,610
what's
every--

37
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,160
everyone doing here so early?

38
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,970
Early?

39
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,630
Darling,by the look of the calendar,we
should've been here six months ago.

40
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,040
She doesn't understand what
goes into planning a wedding.

41
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,260
Breathe.

42
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,750
Sip...

43
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,230
and breathe.

44
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,590
The police haven't found
anything on our jane doe.

45
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,770
Well,I believe she
calls herself ava now.

46
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,780
Yes,well,she doesn't seem to
be getting her memory back.

47
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,700
Well,now that the rest of her medical problems
are taken care of,I'll see what I can do.

48
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,300
- That'd be great.Thanks.
- Has anybody seen addison?

49
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,630
- Uh,she's gone.
- Gone?

50
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,880
- She took a leave of absence.
- Why?

51
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,870
- I mean,did she-- did she tell you
why? - What'd you do to her,mark?

52
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,500
She didn't give a reason.

53
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,630
Did she tell you where she was going?

54
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,330
all she said was she needed some time,

55
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,320
"to be happy and free,"if
I recall correctly.

56
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,120
Excuse me.

57
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,310
I'm sorry.I'm sorry. it's just...

58
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,730
um...

59
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,990
where I come from...

60
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,000
elevators tend to be
this kind of aphrodisiac.

61
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,650
you know?People get on 'em,and
they just get all horny.

62
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,330
Oh,no! No,no.

63
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,220
Not that I'm,uh,not that
I'm talking about you and I.

64
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,090
No. I'm--I'm just
saying,it--it's a relief.

65
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,430
You know,to be on a not horny elevator.

66
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,170
You know? Just get on...

67
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,880
and ride...

68
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,970
without the sex.

69
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,110
right?

70
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,480
oh,my god.

71
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,810
I'm becoming a crazy freak...

72
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,560
a crazy,inappropriately chatting freak.

73
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,270
becoming?

74
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,260
seems like you're already there.

75
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,210
hey.

76
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,640
Oh,hi.

77
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,030
Hello.

78
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,320
Someone have bones that
need resetting or...

79
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,910
bridesmaid.

80
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,720
Excuse me?

81
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,340
Bridesmaid.

82
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,920
My mother and...

83
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,270
burke's mother have been
talking on the phone,

84
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,510
and now they are here...

85
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,840
- with me.
- to plan the wedding.

86
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,420
Oh.

87
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,570
Cristina led us to believe
that you were friends.

88
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,160
- okay. I guess.
- Good.

89
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,310
It's settled.

90
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,530
uh,whoa. Wait. Um...

91
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,980
what are you--
are you--are you...

92
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,850
you actually asking me to be--
to be one of my bridesmaids?

93
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,290
- did you get any sleep?
- I did,actually,

94
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,670
after I evicted a raccoon who chewed
his way into the luggage compartment.

95
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,660
- The trailer.
- Yes.

96
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,050
So while you were sleeping...

97
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,610
when I drowned,

98
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,050
it was different for
you than it was for me.

99
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,920
Something happened to me.

100
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,240
And I really don't know how to
explain it without sounding like...

101
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,130
I just-- I
feel different.

102
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,840
I wanna be better at
everything,and I wanna let you in.

103
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,690
I swear.

104
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,900
Did you practice that?

105
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,320
with hand gestures,but I dropped those.

106
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,430
Just,now is not the time
to give up on me,okay?

107
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,370
That's what I'm saying.

108
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,410
Okay.

109
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,150
- Okay?
- Yep.

110
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,330
Oceanside wellness group.

111
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,660
Uh,yes. You're confirmed
for tuesday at 4:00.

112
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,050
Oh,no.No,ma'am. No,I'm not a doctor.

113
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,950
yeah,I don't know what you should
do about the itchiness "down there.

114
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,350
" Okay.Okay. Okay,bye.

115
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,100
Hi.

116
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,640

00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,970

place. I'm looking for,uh...

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,060

Addison!

120
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,700
Oh,my god.

121
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,400
You got so big.

122
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,190
What are you,like,45 now?

123
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,270

addison.

125
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,510
Naomi.

126
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,270
Surprise!

127
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,170
Oh,I got lost like eight times,

128
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,810
smell like someone who's been
driving in car a for two days,

129
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,590
and I think I just had some kind of
psychotic break in your elevator,but,um...

130
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,160
surprise!

131
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,090
maya,go get your backpack.

132
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,480
so...

133
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,310
- what do you want,addison?
- I miss you.

134
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,690
Really?

135
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,840
'Cause I haven't heard
from you in over a year.

136
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,810
Unless you count the
christmas card,which was nice.

137
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,810
I know,I know. I'm sorry
about--I'm sorry about that.

138
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,710
I left you messages on
your pager. I e-mailed you.

139
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,900
I had some really special
conversations with your voice mail.

140
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,820
Can we just let this go? I've been
having some rough times lately,okay?

141
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,260
- I got divorced.
- So did I.

142
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,280
Oh,my god.

143
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,920
You and sam?

144
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,830
addison.

145
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,850

147
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,520
- sam,I'd say good to see you,but...
- yeah.

148
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,060
Your face is everywhere.

149
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,810
"body language"?

150
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,090
uh,yeah,I just-- I had a few
thoughts,I wrote 'em down,and that'S...

151
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,700
and now you're the
common man's medical guru.

152
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,270
Hey,dell,can you push my
appointments back an hour?

153
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,640
- Oh.
- I have to rescue cooper.

154
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,650
This is addison.
Addison,this is our shrink.

155
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,280
Violet. Hi.Bye.

156
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,840
- What did cooper do this time?
- What does cooper always do?

157
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,850
a woman.

158
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,440
I'm his colleague,not his chauffeur.

159
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,040
So this is,uh... co-op medicine,huh?

160
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,290
Yeah,doctors working together.

161
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,550
It's me,naomi,

162
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,180
we have a pediatrician,a shrink,an
alternative medicine practitioner--

163
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,750
- could--could you excuse us
for just a minute? - Sure,I can.

164
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,000
- Good morning,naomi.
- Oh,shut up.

165
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,770
So you two still work together?

166
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,260
hey,pete.

167
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,470
Who is that redhead with your ex-wife?

168
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,080
She's hot.

169
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,690
Possibly insane,but hot.

170
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,670
Don't even think about it.

171
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,070
You work with your ex-husband

172
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,700
in a shrine for your ex-husband.

173
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,430
It's actually a good book.

174
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,660
And we're friends. We stayed
friends even after we got divorced.

175
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,480
It's very healthy. We're healthy.

176
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,520
What happened between you and sam?

177
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,740
Addison,you and I were close in
med school. It was a long time ago.

178
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,060
Oh,naomi,

179
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,270
come on.

180
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,340
You can't stay mad at me forever.

181
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,110
I know you.

182
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,100
- You got fat.
- I did not.

183
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,910
- Your hair looks hideous.
- It does not.

184
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,670
And you're getting really,really ugly.

185
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,470
I've missed you,too.

186
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,910
so...

187
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,460
why are you really here?

188
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,040
You're a fertility
specialist,one of the best.

189
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,820
- You want to have a baby?
- I want to have a baby.

194
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,010
You sure you're in the right place?

195
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,670
I have reflux...

196
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,820
acid reflux.

197
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,290
And the,uh,hiccups come and go...

198
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,400
when it gets really bad.

199
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,120
they've stopped a few times,but
lately it's been getting...

200
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,700
worse.

201
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,980
- have you had chlorpromazine?Here you go.
- Thank you.

202
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,560
Um,isn't that the crazy person's drug?

203
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,110
it's used as an anti-psychotic,

204
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,860
but it's helpful with hiccups.

205
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,640
and if we don't stop these
soon,you will be a crazy person.

206
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,530
ah.

207
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,040
okay.

208
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,750
Hey,how is meredith doing?

209
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,990
I know they have that big intern exam
coming up,and she's been really busy.

210
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,040
I tried to call,but...

211
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,880
uh...

212
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,080
hey,no hiccups.

213
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,000
chlorpromazine.

214
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,510
You know,I'm not getting any younger,you
know?And I always planned to have one,

215
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,720
it's just--well,now clearly,a
man is not in the cards for me.

216
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,610
I mean,this is addison
post mcdreamy,post mcsteamy.

217
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,250
- You know,I just have to...
- mcwhat?

218
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,980
Forget it. You know what?
Let's never "mc" anything.

219
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,210
A baby,that is...

220
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,760
my answer.

221
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,060
Find a sperm donor,have a baby.

222
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,300
My new
dream--a baby.

223
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,880
A baby's not really an answer. It's
more of a crying,puking,non-answer.

224
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,660
- Yeah,but you did it.
- Yeah,with a husband.

225
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,700
Yeah,but you did it. You
got married,you had a baby.

226
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,300
You're my example.

227
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,760
Okay,we should check your F.S.H.

228
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,680
And your estradiol levels,and we should
probably do and antral follicle count.

229
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,300
Holy crap.

230
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,070
I'm gonna have a baby.

231
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,830
ooh. The treadmill,huh?

232
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,270
Okay,what's going on?

233
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,320
I tried to take it up to ten and do
the hilly terrain mode,which you can do,

234
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,830
but only if you're an olympian,so
I paused and I went flying off.

235
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,120
No. I mean,what's going on with
you pushing yourself this hard?

236
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,280
This is your fourth sports
injury in three months.

237
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,810
I am a sexual person.

238
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,650
I'm a normal sexual person.

239
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,780
I like sex. I need sex.

240
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,810
And he won't do it. He
won't have sex with me.

241
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,980
He just... won'T.

242
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,250
I'm hoping you're talking about your husband. Well,I'm not
hoping because of the no sex part-- it's been 18 months.

243
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,490
-Vit's been 18 months.
- Wow.

244
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,190
18 months!

245
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,150
Do you have any idea what that is like?

246
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,680
My husband won't do it.

247
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,290
- So you know what I do?
- Uh,you run.

248
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,420
I run. I run so I won't
sleep with someone else.

249
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,020
I run so I have someplace
to channel my energies.

250
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,580
I run so I won't pick up a tire
iron and beat my husband to death.

251
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,590
I need sex!

252
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,970
- You'd do it with me,right?
- Hmm?

253
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,480
I think you need to spend
some time with our therapist.

254
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,140
hey!

255
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,600
hey.

256
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,160
thanks for the ride.

257
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,450
- hey,have you been crying?
- Where's your car?

258
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,710
- Were you crying?
- Where's your car?

259
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,840
- Were you crying?
- You wanna walk?

260
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,030
I met a girl at a bar...

261
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,890
on the internet...

262
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,050
and she borrowed my car.

263
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,950
- did you file a police report? She might bring the car back.She was gorgeous and hot and s
-

264
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,620
okay,cooper,cooper,cooper.

265
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,190
All right,so you meet a strange
woman on the internet again.

266
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:50,140
You bring her back to your
apartment to have sex with you again,

267
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,270
and she steals from you again.

268
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,570
What does that suggest to you about you?

269
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,210
That I'm an optimist.

270
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,590
That I believe in magic.t
there is a soul mate...

271
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,090
out there waiting for me.

272
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,140
oh,violet...

273
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,800
allan's not worth it.
You deserve better.

274
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,350
I know that. I do.

275
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,750
I'm not...

276
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,640
I'm not crying about him. I'm not.

277
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,050
don't look at me. Look over there.

278
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,450
I switched my hours at the clinic
so I can go to the bridal shop.Yay!

279
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,540
Did she cheer? She just cheered.

280
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,980
- Someone's not being very bride-
- I am not a bride.I am a surgeon.

281
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,990
Don't tease the caged animal.

282
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,790
You're not excited?

283
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,840
I'm excited. I love weddings.

284
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,040
Weddings are all about
hope and the future.

285
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,970
Okay. I rescheduled an A.C.L.

286
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,360
Repair,but I wanna be clear.

287
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,470
I will not be wearing pink or baby
blue. I do not do flowers in my hair.

288
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,610
And I will never be seen
with a bow on my ass,okay?

289
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,680
See? She's got the right attitude.

290
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,550
thank you very much.

291
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,570
Hey.

292
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,920
hey.

293
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,510
Hi.

294
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,960
I--I'm here with susan.
She's down in the clinic.

295
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,970
- The clinic?Is everything okay?
- yeah.

296
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,550
Callie's a bridesmaid?

297
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,060
Yeah.Yeah,ca--yes,of course.
Callie's a bridesmaid.

298
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,290
- fun.
- yeah.

299
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,520
Yeah.

300
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,270
You gotta do it. That kid of yours
is gonna need you on your feet.

301
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:31,460
She's cute,huh? She's
a cute shriveled kid.

302
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,760
She's cute.Come on. Let's keep walking.

303
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,010
so... where is she?

304
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,870
Red--I thought
that was on.

305
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,290
- walk.
- Gossip.

306
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,850
Oh,you called it.

307
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,720
She was too serious
about the whole thing.

308
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,580
- And alex is a rolling stone.
- I was being thoughtful.

309
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,980
Yeah,right.And dumping red
after one night is sensitive?

310
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,690
Come on. You need to buff up.

311
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,830
So did she just take off?

312
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,440
What'd you say to her? Did she cry?

313
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:01,860
ow.

314
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,910
Idiot. You divorced naomi?

315
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:07,110
Look,just mind your
own business,ok--ouch.

316
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,820
Moron.She is my best friend.

317
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,090
Stop hitting me on top of my head.

318
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,380
- Did you
cheat?Di- - okay.

319
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,730
two things I learned way
back in kindergarten--

320
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,150
one,keep your hands to yourself,

321
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,500
two,he who smelt it dealt it.

322
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,730
- That makes no sense.
- Yeah.Well...

323
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,970
you cheated.

324
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,500
You cheated on your husband
with his best friend.

325
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,320
There.Smelt it,dealt
it-- it works.

326
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,120
You're using fart logic.

327
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,830
Hey,if you want details,go see
naomi. She won't talk about it.

328
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,440
- Well,then you get no details.
- I'm on her side.You know that.

329
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,650
- That's why you get no details.
- Oh,details!

330
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,150
Woman,be quiet.

331
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,180
I've missed you.

332
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,790
Yeah.

333
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,990
Well,you know,naomi's known you longer,

334
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,330
so she gets custody
of you in the divorce.

335
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,530
yeah.

336
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,330
so,uh,other than project
baby,this is strictly a vacation.

337
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:09,170
I am here to read trashy
novels and go to the beach.

338
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,610
Okay,nobody over 30 goes to the beach.

339
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,870
- You should stay here at the practice,
- hang on.

340
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,810
see how we work.

341
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,990
it's more fun than a stuffy hospital.

342
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,620
and we have an empty office.

343
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,440
Nai,are you trying to lure me?

344
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,740
look,maybe. We do have
sunshine and cute boys.

345
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:30,000
Yeah,speaking of which,cute boy behind
the desk is tracking you with his eyes.

346
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,660
- No,he's not.
- Oh,cute boy wants naomi.

347
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:38,240
okay,maybe you should shut up... and
go get some coffee or something...

348
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,380
please.

349
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,280
- You have to stop that.
- Stop what?

350
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,900
You cannot  watch me like that. It'S...

351
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,150
not something you can
do. I won't allow it.

352
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,010
You can't make rules about my eyes.

353
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,620
- that's enough!
- no!

354
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,830
- Did you hear that?
- all of you,just stop it!

355
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,870
Did you hear that?

356
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,000
- What was that?
- Did I just hear--

357
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,220
- I'm the father of that child!
- No,I'm the father!

358
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,080
- If it's anybody's baby,it's mine!
- Stop it!

359
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,010
- calm down,everybody!Just--
- hey,hey,hey,hey!

360
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,180
A little help here. A little help.

361
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,700
- oh,my god,cooper!
- cooper!

362
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,130
Oh,Dr.Freedman!

363
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,770
- Oh,god!
- Oh,that's great.

364
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,970
- Really great.
- You gotta be kidding me.

365
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,640
- you could've called.
- Oh,it's such a silly problem.

366
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,610
- Hiccups?
- We didn't want to bother you.

367
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,660
well,it's not silly if you can't sleep.

368
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,430
Chlorpromazine is good,but it
doesn't always work long-term.

369
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,820
we've had some good result
with endoscopic gastroplication.

370
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,270
We put a tube down your throat

371
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,420
and sew together the
bottom of your esophagus

372
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,570
to protect it from the
acid in your stomach.

373
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,330
It would be an outpatient procedure.

374
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,510
I'm sold. Ready when you are.

375
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:56,700
You're sure that that's not-- just think of it like
breathing into a very expensive brown paper bag.

376
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,190
okay,let me see if I can
explain this to everyone.

377
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,020
So carol was married to rick.

378
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,790
Carol is now married to doug.

379
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,520
Keith is lisa's husband.

380
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,210
- Uh,I'm rick's husband.
- Life partner.

381
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,850
- You're just mad I left you for a man.
- I'm lisa's husband.

382
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,210
- And lisa is the-- surrogate carrying
my child. - surrogate carrying my child.

383
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,290
- Our child.
- you are not the father!You don't know that,rick!

384
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,350
- I am so sick of you!
- Hey,hey!

385
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,660
O-okay,okay.

386
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,980
Let's all try to remember that
we are in a place of healing.

387
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,040
Uh,lisa...

388
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,450
h-how are you feeling?

389
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,510
guilty. Guilty is how she is feeling.

390
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,400
wh-why is that,lisa?

391
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,980
Because the same week that I
brought her here to be inseminated,

392
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,110
she had sex with him...

393
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,580
and him...

394
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,150
and him.

395
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,360
And we have no idea who the father is.

396
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,430
yeah,she,um,really gets around.

397
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,870
Okay,how does this happen? How do you
pick a super freak for a surrogate?

398
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,350
I-I screened her. There was
nothing thereto indicate she was--

399
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,840
sex crazed?

400
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,460
- Insatiable?
- Cooper-like?

401
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,570
Ooh. Okay.

402
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,620
The point is,everybody's
flipping out over nothing.

403
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,560
Medically,it has to be rick's baby.

404
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,780
We implanted lisa with a fertilized
embryo from carol's egg and rick's sperm.

405
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,850
Then rick implanted some more
of his own for good measure.

406
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,440
- before he decided he was gay.
- I've treated doug.

407
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,390
I have him on valerian
root for anxiety and stress.

408
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,880
And I knew he was fooling around,but
with his new wife's surrogate?

409
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,920
Can I just,uh...

410
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,400
I think the more pressing issue,uh,here,

411
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,760
is that,uh,lisa's had no prenatal care.

412
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,400
- She took off right after
her,uh¡ª -  sex-a-thon?

413
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,750
Hi.We haven't officially met.

414
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,040
Cooper. Pediatrics.

415
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,560
Hi.Uh,yeah,she...

416
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,300
left town,and,uh,she and the
baby need a complete workup.

417
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,150
Um,who's your usual G.Y.N?

418
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,490
Uh,she left the
practice rather suddenly.

419
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,900
I didn't do anything.

420
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,550
Well,look,I would be happy to
examine her. Trashy novels can wait.

421
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,410
Have you ever thought of...

422
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,790
plying your trade in
sunnier climes,addison?

423
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,580
"Sunnier climes"?

424
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,840
Now we see why he has
to type to pick up women.

425
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,890
Hey!

426
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:14,550
Besides,we have a very strict
no consorting rule here now.

427
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:19,220
I didn't do anything.

428
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,680
I can't wait to tell meredith her
stepmom hiccupped through the whole thing.

429
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,200
She should be here for this.

430
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,600
Susan asked her to be with her father.

431
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,690
She said he's having a lot of anxiety.

432
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,610
And...

433
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,200
meredith is supposed to help with that?

434
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,960
you know there's nothing to worry about.

435
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,270
what I...

436
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:52,680
what I worry about is molly living in a
new city alone with a baby most of the day.

437
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:57,740
That's hard. And lexie,who'S...about
to start her residency.

438
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,610
She's a really good
student,but it's grueling.

439
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,120
I know.

440
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,240
You know. Right.

441
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:07,650
And... I worry about you,too.

442
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:10,890
How you're getting on,your
mom-- none of that was...

443
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,670
simple.

444
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,930
Susan's really on you to talk to me,huh?

445
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,790
I got to admit,I'm envious...

446
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,370
that she's getting to
know you,and I'm not yet.

447
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,290
I think she may be faking these hiccups.

448
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,670
To get...

449
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,950
us in the same place?

450
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,210
I guess I'm just not very sexual.

451
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,670
He's having an affair. He's
not in love with me anymore.

452
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:48,580
That's not true,honey. I
love you.I love you so much.

453
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,040
I-I want to do it.

454
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,600
I just want to want to do it.

455
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,360
Okay,paul,I'm gonna give you
some homework for next session.

456
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,590
Homework?

457
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,790
- Have sex with your wife.
- Yay!

458
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,480
- Well,but- -
no matter what.

459
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,090
Whether you're in the
mood or not,have sex.

460
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,500
Do it in the bed,do it on the
kitchen floor. Do you have a pool?

461
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,180
- Yes.
- Okay,do it in the pool.

462
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,450
Have sex. No pressure,no
judgment,no expectations.

463
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,190
Have sex. Just...do it.

464
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,550
- We do need a new G.Y.N.
- Right.

465
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,710
And addison seems...

466
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,600
oh.Nuh-unh.No.Absolutely not.

467
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,470
- What?
- Addison is a nice person.

468
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,520
She is a decent person. She is a person.

469
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,780
- I'm lookin' for a person.
- Man,you're just looking.

470
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,930
At least I'm trying.

471
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,690
Dr.Feelgood.

472
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,230
- Hey.
- I love you.

473
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,640
Hi. Thank you.

474
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,340
Okay,dr.Feelgood, this
is what I'm saying.

475
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:53,360
Your career is taking off,girls like
that are throwing themselves at you.

476
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,280
- You should be celebrating.
- Celebrating? I just got a divorce.

477
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,850
You got a little tiny dog,and you
cook it chicken,and you talk to it.

478
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,570
- That's not normal.
- Hey,easy.All right?

479
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:06,450
I'm alone because I choose
to be. It's--it's a choice.

480
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,380
So you're saying that you're not
interested in addison,but I can't have her.

481
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,100
See,addison isn't the
type of woman you have.

482
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,040
She's a marriage woman. All right?

483
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,140
- She's gonna want a commitment,and
you- - hey,I do not sleep around.

484
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,950
No. You are a serial
monogamist,all right?

485
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,920
You--you date a girl,you romance a
girl,and then when it's time to commit,

486
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,400
- you cut and you run.
- I do not.

487
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,700
Linda,uh,karen,uh,julie.

488
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,020
Then there was
tricia,amy,carrie,the other linda-

489
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,570
- we can't forget- -
fine. I won't ask her out.

490
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,440
Good boy. That's a good boy.

491
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:40,680
and the week before I implanted the
embryo,you slept with how many,three?

492
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,090
Three men.

493
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,290
We're almost done here,lisa,and
then we'll do the amniocentesis.

494
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,740
- You're on carol's side.
- I'm carol's doctor.

495
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,380
You came to us.You applied to be
a surrogate. It was your choice.

496
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,480
I know.I
just--

497
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,060
I was about to hand my body over to a
baby that's not mine for nine months,

498
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,540
which is a big responsibility.That...

499
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:05,180
hit me-- the
responsibility-- and I just...

500
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,880
they all wanted me.

501
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,400
me.

502
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,060
And f-for once,I just
stopped thinking and I just...

503
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,300
I did something wild.

504
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:27,790
- dr.Montgomery,is something wrong?
- I'm gonna run some more tests.

505
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,020
You promise me you'll take it easy.

506
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:37,680
I have a stack of dvds to watch,and I
expect your father to feed me by hand.

507
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,130
So just call if you have any questions.

508
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:48,320
It was nice t-talking with you.

509
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,910
- Bye. -
Bye-bye.

510
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,770
any news about mercy west?

511
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,490
Uh,there's a spot.

512
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:12,020
There's a lot of takers,but
they said it looks good.

513
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:15,840
- So after the intern exam-
- I'm not an unfaithful guy.

514
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,780
I'm not a cheater.

515
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,520
You think it'll happen
again if you stay here...

516
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,030
- no.I don't know.
- With me?

517
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,690
George.

518
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,990
I have to go.

519
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,170
- sam.
- Yeah.

520
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:37,930
So paul and kathy,I gave them an
assignment. I told 'em to do it.

521
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,130
- He didn't rise to the occasion.
- Nothing?

522
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,870
- No wood.
- Not even a twig.

523
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,190
There's gotta be something
physical going on,right?

524
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:49,250
Because the only other option-- that
he just doesn't love her anymore--

525
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,820
- I mean,that's just...
- not the only option.

526
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:55,540
I mean,did they meet in the
drama department in college?

527
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,110
Could be a thyroid thing,anemia.
Could be a bunch of stuff.

528
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,070
- Have you checked for extreme ugliness?
- Okay,not funny.

529
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,300
- Will you get back to me...
- yes,I will.

530
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,270
- With what you find soon?
- Okay.Yes.

531
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,340
And,cooper,you know what?

532
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,030
- Ugly people have sex,cooper.
- Ew.

533
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,490
- Ugly people are people,too.
- Okay.

534
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,710
hello?

535
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,290
Hello?

536
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,720
Hello?

537
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,770
Hello?

538
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,950
you fill out this E.E.G. Request on ava?

539
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:38,990
Yeah,you asked for it.

540
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,790
I asked you to run labs on her every
other day. What the hell is this?

541
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,510
Shepherd's doing a full neuro
workup. Just get the hell of my--

542
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:48,540
go ahead. I would love to
have an excuse to lay you out.

543
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,890
I didn't do anything.

544
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:53,680
Whatever you didn't do sent
addison running for the hills.

545
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:07,970
Okay,this guy is 6'2",dark
hair,green eyes,totally healthy.

546
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,210
He plays the violin,and
he's a physicist.

547
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:13,120
That is good sperm.

548
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,400
Geeky,but,uh,good.

549
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,080
Lisa has extra donors if
you want to borrow one.

550
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,000
Her tests come in yet?

551
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,990
No,tomorrow. I don't want to ring
any alarm bells till we're sure.

552
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,190
What about this guy? He's a
marine biologist.Good hair.

553
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:31,580
Are you sure you want
to do this,have a baby?

554
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:34,310
Your life is really gonna change.

555
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,270
That's why I'm doing this.

556
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,160
I want my life to change. I need...

557
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,410
my life to change.

558
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:44,980
I mean,look,you have
maya. You're family.

559
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,420
You did everything the way you
were supposed to. You didn't wait.

560
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,270
Maybe I should have.

561
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,510
Waited.

562
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,180
What do you mean?

563
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:00,370
addison,I did everything exactly
the way I was supposed to.

564
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,210
After college,I never dated anybody
but sam,because he was the one.

565
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:08,530
I never had sex with anybody but
sam because cheating is wrong.

566
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:10,820
I had a baby because...

567
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,110
that's what you do when you get married.

568
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:16,860
I never made a single mistake.
I did everything right.

569
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:20,690
And then sam comes home
and says he wants a divorce.

570
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,510
So all those photos you're...

571
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:28,770
busy admiring,all they are are
reminders of all the stuff I didn't do.

572
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,460
I'm 38 years old,and I
don't know how to have fun.

573
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,530
That's not lucky. That's sad.So just...

574
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,160
shut up about lucky!

575
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,500
Poor...

576
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,490
sad... dried up naomi.

577
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,890
Shut up.

578
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:53,720
Poor little,special
talented doctor girl.

579
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,000
let's make a
made-for-tv movie...

580
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,150
about the poor little,dried
up special girl who has no fun.

581
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:04,480
I could put you out. You'd
have to sleep in the car.

582
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,950
I just...

583
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:10,660
I just wish I'd been
a little more like you.

584
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,500
What,an adulterous bitch
who forgot to have kids?

585
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,400
Violet?

586
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,300
- Allan.
- Hey!

587
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,460
Great to see you.

588
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,840
- How you doing?
- I'm great.

589
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,850
Really. I'm really wonderful.

590
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,210
Well,I saw you and I--
I didn't want to be rude.

591
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,170
So I hope it's okay.

592
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,030
you know,it's just... it's
really wonderful to see you.

593
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,260
You look,uh...

594
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,350
you look really wonderful.

595
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:02,550
They didn't have the gouda you
like,but they had a camembert-

596
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,960
- hi.
- Hi.

597
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,940
This is violet.

598
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,100
Violet--oh,violet.

599
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,170
Hi. Nice to meet you.

600
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,450
I-I'm cami.

601
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:16,160
- Okay.
- Allan's wife.

602
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,480
god,I still can't get
used to that word--wife.

603
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,130
- yeah.
- Wife?

604
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,760
- How long have you been married?
- Newlyweds-- eight weeks.

605
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,750
Oh.

606
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,380
Congratulations.

607
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,680
We'll see you.

608
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,670
nice to meet you.

609
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:13,750
hey,addison,uh,latte? Or
ac--more of a cappuccino.

610
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:17,540
- Lisa's baby has something called placenta accreta.
- Is that bad?

611
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,970
The placenta abnormally
attaches to the uterine wall.

612
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:23,380
It makes delivering dangerous
for both mom and baby.

613
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,630
- But there was something else.
- That's not enough?

614
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:30,380
The baby has some genetic markers
that don't match carol,just lisa.

615
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,270
What? The
embryo--

616
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,640
- did not implant.
- This is lisa's baby?

617
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,300
Which also means that the paternity
is once again up for grabs.

618
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,570
- Good luck.
- I'm off to the beach.

619
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,860
Uh,you can't leave. Someone
has to tell the patient.

620
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,400
Honestly,I
ha--I have...

621
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,360
low people skills with anybody over 12.

622
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,820
It--it's true. An internet
hooker just stole his car--

623
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,420
violet! Privacy.
She was not--

624
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:58,840
she just...she borrowed my car.

625
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,410
she--she
borrowed it.

626
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,890
Borrowed.

627
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,840
911 turbo,hand-sewn leather seats.

628
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,140
911 turbo with hand-sewn leather seats.

629
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:21,100
Who does that to a 911?

630
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,210
A chick. A crazy chick.

631
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,250
- But she was so hot.
- A crazy hot chick.

632
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,860
I loved that car.

633
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,950
That was a single man's car.

634
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:33,860
That's the point. I mean,I-- I
thought maybe I was done being single.

635
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,330
I thought she was gonna be
the mother of my children.

636
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,690
What was her name again?

637
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:42,000
Sexyboobs316.

638
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,070
are you... dude,are you crying?

639
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,490
No.

640
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:54,300
You better be crying about that
car and not over sexyboobs315.

641
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,830
316. 316.

642
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,430
I can'T.I-I can'T. I'm gonna hurt him.

643
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:03,620
Let's just say he's crying
over the car and the woman.

644
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,080
All right? There we go.

645
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,910
Let it out.

646
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,700
let it out.

647
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,360
Uh,cristina?

648
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,900
That's a pretty one.

649
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,680
Moves very well in it.
Looks quite natural.

650
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,410
- You paged?
- I need you over here.

651
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:33,320
Should I be seeing you in
the dress before the wedding?

652
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,550
You think I'm wearing this?

653
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,650
- well,it is very feminine.
- Exactly.

654
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:45,810
Do you know your mother booked
a chapel that sits 200 people?

655
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,040
Okay,how did i get bridesmaids,huh?

656
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,870
freakin' stupid cotton-candy
colored bridesmaids?

657
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,080
No offense.

658
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,410
what happened to our small ceremony?

659
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:58,190
What happened to you
and me at city hall?

660
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,810
I didn't--I didn't
think you were serious.

661
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,720
I am not wearing this.

662
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,530
Oh,I gotta get to the hospital.

663
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:11,110
You know,we should,uh,give
'em some privacy.

664
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,170
What?

665
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,990
Oh! Oh,you want me to
go over there with you...

666
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,010
- by myself.
- Yeah.

667
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:23,370
You want a big wedding?

668
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,600
You want the chapel,you want the
guests and me in a white dress?

669
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,940
Well...

670
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,320
yes.

671
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,400
I'm a traditional man,cristina.

672
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,630
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

673
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:48,030
The saleslady has another batch
of dresses for you to see,cristina.

674
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,260
Oh,thank you... mama.

675
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:01,140
Cristina has certainly
made quite an effort.

676
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,470
Tried on,I would say,over
a hundred dresses,

677
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:07,550
and that certainly could
not have been easy for her.

678
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:10,910
Yeah,mama,I know she seems
disinterested in wedding planning.

679
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,220
But cristina...

680
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,860
she's not cold.

681
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,120
- I know she seems
cold-- - preston...

682
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:21,330
if you think cristina is
right for you,I trust you.

683
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,800
I trust your instincts.

684
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,510
and the baby-- the,um,the
baby isn't even mine?

685
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,440
- Honey,calm down.
- Calm down?

686
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,000
You mean I can keep
this baby if I want to?

687
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,880
Uh,legally,yes.

688
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,390
So who's the father?

689
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:53,430
We won't know the paternity of
the baby till after lisa delivers.

690
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,580
More urgent at the moment
is the placenta accreta.

691
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:01,530
The fact is,lisa is at risk of having
a life-threatening hemorrhage and

692
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,740
the baby could deliver preterm.

693
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,640
So you're saying they could die?

694
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,460
There is a risk of death,yes.

695
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:11,470
Lisa,I know you're scared.

696
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:15,420
If you do go into preterm
labor,you'll have a c-section.

697
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,970
And they'll monitor it
and control it so that

698
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:21,700
they have a better chance of
saving your uterus and your life.

699
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,540
And you'll save us,me and the baby?

700
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,410
Well,I have...

701
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,420
I have to get back to
seattle. I have a practice.

702
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,100
But I can refer you
to someone local who--

703
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,900
no,I want you.You be there.

704
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,950
I thought kathy was coming
to the appointment today.

705
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,680
oh.

706
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,560
Just--kathy didn't
come home last night.

707
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,990
And,you know,I don't
blame her,but it's just...

708
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,300
what--what if she's
with some guy right now?

709
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,760
Some guy--some--some
guy who can...

710
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,490
- who can bring it?
- Okay.

711
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,990
Let's not get ahead of
ourselves. It's okay.All right?

712
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:08,150
There are plenty of medical reasons
for low sex drive. All right?

713
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,280
Sorry. Sorry.

714
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,890
- Honey...
- where were you?

715
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,140
I was out.

716
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,980
All night?

717
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,810
And I had a chance to cheat,believe me.

718
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:23,110
But I passed. Okay?

719
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:26,870
I passed up being with someone who actually
wants to be with me because I am stuck with you.

720
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,240
you're crying?

721
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,130
Okay,let's--let's all
just calm down here.

722
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,250
All right-- I'll be
in the waiting room.

723
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,280
Oh! She's starting to hate me.

724
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,420
What am I gonna do if
little paul can't perform?

725
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,720
Okay.

726
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,110
Don't talk about your penis
while you hug another man.

727
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,750
I'm sorry,man.

728
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,690
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

729
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,110
- Let's draw some blood.
- Okay,let's draw some blood.

730
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,420
What's in L.A.?

731
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,740
What?

732
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,800
For addison.

733
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,930
Any idea...

734
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,800
what she might be doing there?

735
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,880
naomi and sam are down
there,I guess. I don't know.

736
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,410
You all right?

737
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,440
We were gonna try.

738
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:16,080
We were gonna make a go of it...

739
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,240
as a couple.

740
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,860
She bet me I couldn't go
60 days without having sex.

741
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,570
Oh.Let me guess. You couldn't do it.

742
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,460
No,she couldn'T.

743
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,180
She didn't want to be with me.

744
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,320
I thought she did.

745
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,600
I thought she might.

746
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,600
But she didn'T.

747
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,040
And I caught her. You know...

748
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,100
sleeping with somebody else?

749
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:51,240
oh,that must have been so hard for you.

750
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,370
not that I can't relate.

751
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:57,280
So I told her I did it.

752
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,040
You told her you did it?

753
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,800
I told her I lost the bet. I
told her I slept with someone.

754
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,360
I figured if she didn't want to be with
me,she shouldn't have to feel guilty about it.

755
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,830
Selfless.

756
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,710
- That'S...out of character.
- Yeah.

757
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,720
Anyway,uh...

758
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:20,150
I was just wondering if
you knew what was in L.A.

759
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,030
No.

760
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,990
okay,now I am going to the beach.

761
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,420
Wait,addie.

762
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,540
Your test results came back in.

763
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:38,150
Oh,good. Because,um,I picked a donor.

764
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,730
I think I'm gonna go with physicist guy.

765
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,590
Your F.S.H. Level is high.

766
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:47,460
Well,they're high this month.
We can do,uh,ovarian stimulation.

767
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,490
And your antral follicle
count is only two.

768
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,640
That could be due to stress.

769
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,150
Addison,I'm sorry.

770
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,810
I did all the tests.

771
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:02,230
There's no fertility potential here.

772
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,940
okay. Uh...

773
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,390
this is good. This is,um...

774
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:17,170
oh,this is just... perfect.

775
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:19,510
- Addison-- - I
have the great guy.

776
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,770
I don't have a baby because
I'm focusing on my career.

777
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:26,340
And then I have the other guy. I don't have
his baby because he's not the great guy.

778
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:29,430
And now I don't have the
great guy or the other guy,

779
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:32,050
and I'm finally ready to
have a baby,and I can'T.

780
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:34,250
That is so...

781
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:37,560
exactly what my life is.

782
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,210
- Addie,there are other options.
- Yeah,I know about the options.

783
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,390
I'm so sorry.

784
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:47,770
I know how much you wanted this.

785
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,220
It's okay.

786
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,700
I just,um...

787
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,310
I just didn't realize I
was out of time,that's all.

788
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,060
Addie,please
stay so we can--

789
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,440
no,it's okay.I'm fine. Thank you...

790
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:09,820
for telling me.Thank you.
I will see you at home.

791
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,480
looks like you had a bad day.

792
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,290
Okay...

793
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,530
enough.

794
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,770
Okay? Not today.

795
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:31,600
This is not a good day. All right?

796
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,800
So why don't you just...

797
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,540
shut up?

798
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,660
Shut up!....

799
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:50,880
all right,then.
