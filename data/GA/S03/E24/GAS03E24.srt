1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,010
Previously  on "grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,920
- You're gonna transfer to mercy west?
- I have to.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,560
Give me my husband back.

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,730
- Cxief resident?
- The one fifth year resident that rules all residents.

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,510
Your intern exams are in two weeks.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,270
You need to spend every available
minute studying for them.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,260
What happened to our small ceremony?

8
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,580
What happened you and me at city hall?

9
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,910
There's no guarantee the surgery's
gonna bring back your memory.

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,060
- Is there a man in my house?
- I'm so sorry,richard.

11
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,420
And I'm finally ready to have a baby,
and I can't.

12
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,400
We're losing her pulse.She's coding!

13
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,250
We did everything we could.

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,510
A surgeon's education  never ends.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,650
Every patient,every symptom,every operation...

16
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,530
Is a test,a chance for us to demonstrate
how much we know...

17
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,370
And how much more  we have to learn.

18
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,370
- How do you treat pancreatic divisum?Izzie?
- Oh,cristina.

19
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,530
If you're not gonna let us sleep,you at least
have to let me put coffee in my cup.

20
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,380
- Okay,so go.No one's stopping you.
- I'm too tired to go.

21
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,380
Pancreatic divisum.

22
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,510
- Dorsal duct sphincterotomy.
- Not your turn,but correct.You do me.

23
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,650
I can't believe o'malley's missing this.
How's he gonna be ready?

24
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,850
Oh,you're kidding,right?

25
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,210
- We have callie's cards,but george has-
- George has callie.

26
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,150
What's the most frequent cause of diarrhea
in hospitalized patients?

27
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,770
Is she coming to this bachelorette thing tonight?

28
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,810
Rotavirus.Yes.Uh,no!No,no,no.Uh,salmonella.

29
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,920
Diarrhea in  hospitalized patients.

30
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,000
The most frequent cause of diarrhea in
hospitalized patients is C.Diff

31
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:37,510
Which can lead to toxic megacolon,
perforation,sepsis and death.

32
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,880
That's what killed susan.

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,890
- Is she okay?
- Oh,she's fine.

34
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,420
- Dude,she's messed up.
- Of course she's messed up.

35
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,260
Susan was basically her surrogate mother.

36
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,850
Yeah,her fake mom was better than her real mom.

37
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,960
Is she going to the hospital first or the funeral?

38
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,250
First to the hospital,then to the funeral,
then to the test this afternoon.

39
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,410
- Has she even studied?
- Yeah,she studied.She's fine.

40
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:07,100
She just needs to be left alone,okay?
So what's inside the carotid sheath?Izzie?

41
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,050
The internal carotid artery,the internal
jugular vein and the vagus nerve.

42
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,560
Ah,that was too easy.Let's find you a hard one.

43
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:19,850
- Uh,what is this?
- Uh,what is what?

44
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,880
Oh,yeah.That just came this morning.

45
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,400
You got... You got a spot at mercy west!
Why--why didn't you tell me?

46
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,020
Because it's pending the results
of the intern exam.

47
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,960
Oh,you know what this means,don't you?

48
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:36,530
- You,you got,you got into mercy west you got into mercy west
- I haven't told the chief yet.

49
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,880
You'll tell him today.He'll understand.

50
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:45,450
It's a smaller program,fewer residents...
Fewer distractions,more surgeries.

51
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,780
And when I come home and ask you
how your day went,

52
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,410
you can actually tell me
because I won't already know.

53
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,860
- Hi.
- Hi.

54
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:25,290
Look,I... I know this is a-
- an impossible day for you

55
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,330
So...I'm just want to say one thing.

56
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,140
- I brought a black suit,just in case.
- Thank you.

57
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,120
But I think this is something
I need to do by myself.

58
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,960
If you need me,just... Let me know.

59
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,550
- Oh,cristina.
- What is M.E.N.Syndrome?" Don't answer that.

60
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,920
The minister needs to see a copy of
your vows before the wedding.

61
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,040
Multiple endocrine neoplasia.Yes.

62
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,950
Look,I know it's test day,and I'm not supposed
to be talking about the wedding on test day

63
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,400
- But since tomorrow's our wedding day-
- You have five seconds.Go.

64
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,480
Bill adams can't make it.I have no best man.

65
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,200
Oh,no.Baby,I'm so sorry.

66
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,900
- And I need your vows by-
- Okay,time's up.

67
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,470
- Cristina...
- Test day.

68
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,760
- What am I supposed to tell the minister?
- Test day.

69
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,260
They paged you guys,too?

70
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,540
- Well,I think they paged all of us.
- That can't be good.

71
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,830
Sure it can.He could be letting us know
I won the race for chief.

72
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,910
Not today,he isn't.

73
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,210
He's making his recommendation to the board tomorrow
for chief of surgery and chief resident.

74
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,450
Why were we all paged?

75
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,250
Oh,because search and rescue found those lost
climbers who were up on mount rainier.

76
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,840
- People,the climbers are on their way.
- Any specifics?

77
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,820
They found only three so far.
One's still missing.

78
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,990
They're reporting severe dehydration
with traumatic head and chest injuries.

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,650
Dr.Bailey,Dr.Torres,you'll be my trauma team.

80
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,130
- Bad day not to have interns.
- What?

81
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,160
Today's the intern exam.

82
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,480
You'll all have to do your
own heavy lifting today.

83
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,320
And if you see an intern,
which you will,

84
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,850
because they can't help themselves,
turn them away until after the exam.

85
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,400
The ambulances are five minutes away.
It's time to do what we do best,people.Let's roll.

86
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,190
- What is a gerota's fascia?
- Uh,the fascia surrounding the kidney.

87
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,720
- Which is longer,the left or the right renal vein?
- That's right.The left one.

88
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,420
- Looks and smarts-- not bad.
- You think?

89
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,930
She's got my dad's nose,though.

90
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,890
Girl's gotta have a big personality
to pull off that nose.

91
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,030
- What?
- You--you remember your dad?

92
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,100
No.I don't--no.

93
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,830
- You just said-
- I know,but I... I have no idea where that came from.

94
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,100
That was a memory.That's what it's like sometimes.

95
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,780
It doesn't always come back all at once.
It can happen in bits and pieces.

96
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,470
- Don't--don't get all-
- Dude,your memory's coming back.

97
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,570
- So how you feelin',preston?You ready?
- I'm always ready for surgery.

98
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,760
- I think he's talking about the wedding.
- Yeah,tomorrow's the big day.

99
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,160
And apart from the fact that
cristina hasn't written her vows,

100
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:07,120
- My best man just canceled,and it's still raining...
- He's not ready.

101
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,590
You're never ready.I certainly wasn't.

102
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,160
But then... The minute I saw adele coming down
that aisle...

103
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,990
Well... Have you picked your best man?

104
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,390
- Actually,chief,I-
- You can't be his best man.

105
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
- Why not?
- Because it's unethical.

106
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,130
It's a conflict of interest.
The man wants to be chief of surgery.

107
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,300
- Actually,derek-
- Not that that's why you're asking.

108
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,940
- I was... Going to ask you.
- Ask me what?

109
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,550
Really?We have been through a lot this year.

110
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,150
And everybody else turned you down.

111
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,780
Oh,what do I have to do?

112
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,790
Well,traditionally the best man plans
the bachelor party.

113
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,920
- Drinks at joe's after work?
- Yeah.

114
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,420
I knew you were the man for the job.

115
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,190
Dale winick,32,B.P.90 over 50,tachy to 110.

116
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,720
Severe frostbite,but no obvious internal injuries.

117
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,090
- Got it.
- My god.

118
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,710
Yeah,those aren't gloves.

122
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,700
Please someone tell me this guy is ok

123
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,530
They're right behind you.We'll let you know.

124
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,630
Get him a tet-tox and push a gram
of cefazolin I.V.

125
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,490
And let's get some warm,circulating water
to start thawing his hands.

126
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,170
I'll get someone on it.Callie.

127
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,320
We're supposed to be studying.
If bailey finds out we're down here--

128
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,970
we are studying.How do you treat frostbite?

129
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:41,110
Rewarm,avoid early surgery unless
there's a deep infection due to autoamputation.

130
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,900
See?Studying.

131
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:49,040
Okay,okay,mr.Meltzer,mr.Meltzer,
I'm gonna need you to save your breath,okay?

132
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,760
We're gonna give you some pain meds.
You have several broken ribs,

133
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,300
which are compromising your breathing.
You understand?

134
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,360
- Did you see that?
- That is freaky.

135
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,880
I think that was a flail chest.
I've never seen one before.

136
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,150
Come on.Come on.

137
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,300
Why,oh,why does today have to be test day?

138
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,270
Oh,I know.

139
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,940
Look... I bet you if you talk to the chief,
he'll let you take the test later

140
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,950
with the funeral and everything.

141
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,630
- I don't need to take the test later.
- Okay.

142
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,400
- Can I get a little help here?
- I can't feel my legs!

143
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,340
Sir,you have a spinal injury.
You need to stop fighting me and stay calm,okay?

144
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,760
You're only making it worse.Where are we going?

145
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,900
- You guys are going to trauma three.
- All right.Trauma three.

146
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,690
- You okay?
- Yeah.I got accepted at mercy west.

147
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,200
That'S... Are you gonna go?

148
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,010
Well,I kinda have to now,right?

149
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,930
What are you fools doing here?

150
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,490
In a few hours,you people are taking a test that
will determine the course of your entire medical careers

151
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,420
because the five interns with the lowest
test scores will be cut from the program.

152
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,170
But are you studying for this test?No,you're not.

153
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,580
Are you helping out in the E.R.?
You are most certainly not!

154
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,480
Are you getting the hell out of here
before I throw you out?

155
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,700
I think you are.

156
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,710
- Whoa,dr.Shepherd.
- Aren't you supposed to be studying?

157
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,650
- Yeah,I just have a quick question.
- Yeah.

158
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,580
Could the craniotomy you performed
on ava--on jane doe-- could--

159
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,570
- could that have affected her memory?
- Uh,it's doubtful.

160
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,780
I was mostly working in the speech center
of her brain.But you never know.

161
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,510
- Why?
- I think she remembered something.

162
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,230
- Can--can we test her to see if anything's changed?
- Yeah,you can run another W.M.S.R.

163
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,100
But we're gonna have to wait and
see if she remembers anything else.

164
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,030
- Good sign,though.
- Thanks.

165
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,150
- Nice work,dr.Montgomery.
- Oh,thanks.

166
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,550
- I was just directing traffic.
- I was being sarcastic.

167
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,790
- Oh,like brain surgery is so impressive.
- It is,actually.

168
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,080
- Addison.
- Yes?Oh,joe,walter.

169
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,160
What are you guys doing here?Everything okay?

170
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,860
Yeah,we came to see you,actually.

171
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,790
- Uhwe need a consult.
- Don't tell me you're pregnant.

172
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,440
- Uh,no,but-- our birth mom is.
- Potential birth mom.

173
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,300
- She hasn't actually picked us yet.
- You're adopting?

174
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,260
Well,we filed an application,
but we never thought we'd get picked.

175
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,490
You know,bar-owning gays
don't get picked very often.

176
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,260
I guess having a baby is easier than we thought.

177
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,310
Yes,I guess so.

178
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,760
So I was hoping you could take a look at her?

179
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,340
You know,kicking the tires,
checking underneath the hood?

180
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,540
- Car metaphors?No.
- I'd be happy to.

181
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,930
Just,uh,give me a call and
we'll set up an appointment.

182
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,560
Well,see,that's the thing.

183
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:19,310
Uh,she lives in portland,and she's only
gonna be in seattle for one day,so...

184
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,380
She's kind of here now.

185
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:26,690
Now,as in... Now.

186
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,310
- George,wait.Wait a minute.
- Yeah?

187
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,060
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to transfer to mercy west.

188
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,600
- Yeah,I do.
- No.

189
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,250
Just forget about you and me for a second,okay?

190
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,000
What about meredith?What about alex and cristina?

191
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:48,000
Who's gonna hold us together if you're not here?

192
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,280
You're the glue.You're george.

193
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,890
- I can't stay here.I can't...
- No one's making you go.

194
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:58,220
Stay here and see you every day... And not...

195
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:02,120
I can't keep kissing you in elevators.

196
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,350
I know.I know that.

197
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:11,170
I'm married.I'm a married man.

198
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,080
- You busy?
- Cute.What are you doing here?

199
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,570
- Isn't the exam in like-
- yeah,I know,I know.

200
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:24,750
- I just want to run a quick neuro-psych test on you.
- No.No!Go take your test.I-I have a baby to feed.

201
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,560
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Nothing.

202
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,740
You've been sitting in this bed for weeks wishing
you could remember who you were,now suddenly you can.

203
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,800
I can't.It was something I said.

204
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,470
Well,you remember your father's face.

205
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,090
Why are you acting like it's no big deal,
like it happens all the time?

206
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,380
Alex,come on.I-I--it-- that's not...

207
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,490
Unless it does happen all the time.

208
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,860
Tell me the truth.Do you remember?

209
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,170
Do you know who you are?

210
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,920
- What is biloma?
- Cristina,I really don't have time

211
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,580
- A biloma is an intperitoneal bile fluid collection.
- Excellent.

212
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,450
- Okay?I'll be fine.
- Meredith.

213
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,190
- George,I gotta go.
- Your dad.

214
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,850
Hey.I-I-I was just on my way-

215
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,170
No,I-I came here to tell you you're not wanted.

216
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,850
I don't want you at any funeral,meredith.

217
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,280
- Thatcher,why don't you come-
- She trusted you!

218
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,610
She came to you for help,and you killed her.

219
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,440
You did.You killed my wife.You took her from me.

220
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,830
Dad!

221
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,760
So I don't--I don't want to see you.

222
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:31,850
I don't want to hear from you,and
I don't want you anywhere near her funeral.

223
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,210
- You understand me?Do you understand me?
- Dad,dad,come on.

224
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,860
This-- lexie's waiting in the car.
We have to go,dad.We have to go now.

225
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:41,100
She was everything to me,all I had.

226
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,970
She was all I had.

227
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,410
She was all I had.

228
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,410
I can sit here all day.

229
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,190
I'll miss my test,but I will sit here all day.

230
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:17,680
I don't--I...
It happened a few days ago,and I-I just...

231
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:24,130
- I just woke up,and it was all there again.
- And you didn't tell me?

232
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:30,250
Becau-- because there's...
There's nothing to tell.

233
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,580
Why don't I believe that?

234
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:40,290
I was a pregnant woman in a lousy marriage
to the nicest guy anyone's ever met.

235
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,490
- End of story.
- Who--who is he?What does he do?

236
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,610
Wh-where--where did you meet him?

237
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,980
College.
We got married the year after we graduated.

238
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,160
He... I wanted-- I wanted to move to new york,

239
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,980
and he wanted to live on the side of
a mountain and take over his dad's shop.

240
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,240
And he's a woodworker.
He makes beautiful furniture.

241
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:08,220
It's--it's--it's quiet,and he's quiet and...

242
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,030
- I was going out of my mind.
- So you just... Took off?

243
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,390
No,I... I need--I need--I need--
I needed to think and to be around other people,

244
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,130
so I came to seattle,and I...
Thought I'd see the sights,ride the ferry.

245
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,390
- Have you even called him?
- No.

246
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,200
- Why not?
- I left him,alex.

247
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:29,310
So?He's your husband.You should call him.
You want me to call him?

248
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,270
I mean,what's his name?What's your name?

249
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,050
I'm not telling you that.

250
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,910
- We've got everything taken care of.
- You don't have to worry about a thing.

251
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,060
I've got number 2 pencils and bottled water.

252
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:46,650
- Oh,and--and powerbars.
- And you know the material.

253
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,190
You're gonna get a high score-- not as high as mine--
but everything's gonna be fine.

254
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,020
What are you guys all standing around for?

255
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,540
Don't we have a test to-- what happened?

256
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,480
You people need to head upstairs.
Dr.Grey will join you in a minute.

257
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:11,460
You're not to blame for susan grey's death,
and you know it,and your father knows it,too.

258
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:17,350
He's just...
Well,he's never been the best communicator,

259
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,990
and he just lost his wife.

260
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,560
- Stop acting like my surrogate father.
- Meredith,I'm j-- just

261
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,450
because you slept with my mother,
that does not make you my father.

262
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,730
Follow my finger,okay?

263
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,970
Good.

264
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,650
Let me know if you can feel this,okay?

265
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,350
- Yeah,I'm not enjoying that.
- Good.That's a good sign.

266
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,670
It means I'm not paralyzed?

267
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,230
Well,the M.R.I.Will show us the full
extent of the injuries.

268
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,320
But,uh,can we ask you what happened up there?

269
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,230
- It was my fault.
- Dale-- it wasn't your fault.

270
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,130
60 ways to get up mount rainier,
and I had to pick liberty ridg

271
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,630
it wasn't the route.It was the storm.

272
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,050
On a clear day,you don't think about storms.

273
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,620
A minute later,the wind's pasting you
to the side of the mountain,

274
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,440
and you can't see your hand in front of your face.

275
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,810
Is that why you fell,because of the storm?

276
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:25,110
All I know is I felt the rope tug,
and... I was in midair.

277
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,580
We all were.We were tied together.

278
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,710
Must have been a 100-foot drop.

279
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,600
And when we came to,lonnie wasn't moving.

280
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,960
Lonnie?He's your friend who's still missing?

281
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,650
Well,this lonnie,is that why
he didn't make it back,because he was hurt?

282
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,990
- Because he was dead.
- I'm sorry.

283
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,100
We had to leave him.

284
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,520
We had to get to the other side of the mountain,
or we'd be dead,too.

285
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,700
- We had no choice.
- You always have a choice.

286
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,740
You never leave a man behind.

287
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:06,370
Please take your seats,doctors,
and put all study materials away.

288
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,170
Okay,if you don't know the answer,
choose "B." It's always "B."

289
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:13,450
and write your name in the upper right-hand
corner of your answer sheets.

290
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,560
You may open your test booklets... Now.

291
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,540
W-we don't have to be here if
you're uncomfortable.

292
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,880
Oh,no,it's fine.Un-unless you're uncomfortable.

293
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,650
- Actually,uh,I-I-
- he's fine.

294
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,160
So,rina,how are you feeling?Any problems?

295
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:42,130
Just the fact that I'm huge,and I have,like,
the worst heartburn i've ever had in my life.

296
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,100
I can prescribe an antacid for that.

297
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,110
The first thing we're gonna do
is take a look at the baby.

298
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,200
This might be a little cold.

299
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:54,160
This baby deserves parents who
are gonna make it their whole world,you know?

300
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,980
Y-you know we're gay,right?

301
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:00,710
I figured,with you both being boys and everything.

302
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,450
The other couple I'm considering,
they're,like,oh,40.

303
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,470
She's been trying to get pregnant for ten years.

304
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,360
It's so sad.
There's the heartbeat.

305
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,930
There's,like,a person inside of me.

306
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:23,590
Actually... There are two people.Twins.

307
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,800
- Oh,my god.
- Oh,my god.

308
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,730
Oh,my god.I think I'm gonna pass out.

309
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,380
Joe?Joe?

310
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:35,260
Doctors,we are halfway through our allotted time.

311
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:39,850
You only have 60 minutes left
to complete the exam.

312
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,600
Meredith.Meredith!

313
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:29,000
She didn't write anything on the test.
She didn't answer a single question.She just sat there.

314
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:33,560
Wait,g-george,just-- just give her a second.

315
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,840
I've got an extensive antero-lateral flail chest.

316
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:40,160
He'll need surgical stabilization.
Dr.Torres,if you're available,I would really--

317
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,990
she's not.My guy has bone fragments
in his spinal cord,internal fixation.

318
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,740
Dr.Torres is gonna scrub in with me.

319
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,380
Uh,we have more than one orthopedic
surgeon in this hospital.

320
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,270
And you'll need 'em,because dr.Torres and
i are looking at possible multiple amputations.

321
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,940
Guys,I can be there for all of you.
We just have to figure it out.

322
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,850
Dr.Burke asked first.

323
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,190
- Well,I mean,with all due respect-
- okay,you all want torres.Fine.

324
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,630
Rock,paper,scissors.

325
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,170
- One,two,three.
- All rocks.Very typical.Ready?

326
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,250
And...  Rock smashes scissors.

327
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,620
- See you in the O.R.
- Best two out of three.

328
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,490
Dr.Burke!

329
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,640
What?

330
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,790
I just wanted to know how it feels...

331
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:26,020
To not have to spend the next 24 hours wondering
if richard picked you to be chief resident.

332
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,520
How's it feel to be the chosen one?

333
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,860
Feels just fine.

334
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,620
Hey.How'd it go?

335
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:47,470
- Meredith.
- Don't worry.I've got it.

336
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,890
It's not like she actually flunked.
She--she just didn't write anything.

337
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,830
It's kinda like she actually flunked.

338
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,940
One guy two years ago,he was on call
three nights before his test.

339
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,230
He slept through the whole thing.
He had to repeathis intern year.

340
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,010
She can't repeat her intern year.
It's pathetic.We have to do something.

341
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,210
- Cristina.
- What?O-okay,I don't know.

342
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,910
I mean,meredith and i don't fail things.
This is not in my book.

343
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,910
It's bailey.We gotta go.We gotta go.

344
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,570
- We can't just leave her here.
- You got a better idea?

345
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:35,660
Okay,it's,uh,showtime,people.
Yang,you're scrubbing in with dr.Burke.

346
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:40,490
Karev,you're with dr.Montgomery.
Stevens,find dr.Sloan.

347
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,700
- You paged me,too.
- Mercy west.

348
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,800
Callie told you.

349
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:48,360
You're in the best surgical program
in the country,

350
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,780
the toughest,most competitive,most respected.

351
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,260
You want to leave this for mercy west?

352
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,040
- Mercy west-
- is not seattle grace.

353
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,980
Are you trying to...
After all the work that we've put into you,

354
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,270
are you trying to throw your career away?

355
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,720
I'm trying to... Do what's best for me right now.
I've had some personal issues.

356
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,630
I-I don't know what your personal problems
are,and I don't care.

357
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,540
I do care about your career,
so let me make myself clear.

358
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:17,360
This is a mistake.

359
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,930
George...

360
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:48,140
It's like we're on a train that's going 200 miles an hour,
and it would just be so nice to get off

361
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:54,400
and just... Stand on the platform
just for a minute.

362
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:01,410
Looks like I'm off the train.

363
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:09,060
Our parents died.
When a parent dies,it doesn't make any sense.

364
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:15,440
So you make a lot of really terrible decisions...

365
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:19,990
That you're gonna end up having
to live with for a long time.

366
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,650
You should go.You are still on the train.

367
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:40,740
It's okay.You have to go.

368
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:46,260
Go.Go.Go,go.

369
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,380
Addison.

370
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,090
Adele.

371
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,070
What are you doing here?What happened?

372
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,120
A fender bender.I'm fine.I told the E.R.

373
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,300
Resident I'm fine,but...

374
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,410
all right,I'm gonna page richard.I'll let him kno you're here.

375
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,590
Oh,you will do no such thing,addison.

376
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,200
Richard cannot know I'm here.

377
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,470
We're separated.

378
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,060
My life is none of his business.

379
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,300
I'm serious.

380
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,260
Okay.

381
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,610
Uh,all right.Well... let's get you checked out.

382
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,460
Do you have any,um,any pain,any... anything?

383
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,700
Well...  there's one thing I should probably mention.

384
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,210
I'm pregnant.

385
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:54,020
The baby looks fine on the ultrasound,but you are spotting a little.

386
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:58,750
It's nothing severe,but I would like to hold you overnight for observation.

387
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,050
Overnight?Oh,no.I'm sorry

388
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,910
,but-- for just a couple of hours at least.Look,it could be nothing.

389
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,330
But a pregnancy at your age is--

390
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,280
terrifying?Embarrassing?

391
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,360
I was going to say a miracle.

392
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,150
I don't know.I resigned myself to the fact a long time ago

393
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:22,940
that I would never have kids,and here I am,52,about to be divorced and pregnant.

394
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:27,310
May I ask who... the father is?

395
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,740
You may ask.

396
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,600
Look,all I'm saying is that if richard finds out

397
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,450
that you're walking around this hospital carrying another man's baby...

398
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,970
richard is not going to find out because neither one of us are going to tell him.

399
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,380
- Chief.
- Addison.

400
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,150
I just heard the news.

401
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:54,750
You--you heard?

402
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:57,560
who told you?What--what did you hear?

403
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,510
That joe and walter are adopting.

404
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,410
Is the birth mom here?I'd love to put in a good word.

405
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,820
Oh,no,no,no.

406
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,590
Chief,you don't want to go in there.

407
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,860
It's a young girl... in the stirrups,you know,her equipment exposed,right?

408
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,200
You don't want to see that.

409
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,130
No,I-I don't want to see that.

410
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:29,040
are you going to give me an inspirational speech,too?

411
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,770
No.

412
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,030
George.

413
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,510
Oh,I can't talk.I have a patient to prep.

414
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,860
This isn't about you and me.This is about meredith.What are we gonna do?

415
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,920
- There's nothing to do.
- What?

416
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,800
I'm not even gonna be here in a week,so...

417
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:52,370
so your transferring to another hospital means we're not gonna be friends anymore?

418
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,870
Why are you doing this,george?

419
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,760
Didn't you hear a word of what bailey said?

420
00:26:56,770 --> 00:27:00,180
what were we supposed to do,hmm,carry him down the mountain?

421
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,600
he was our friend,and we left him there.

422
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,770
If we hadn't,'d be dead,too.

423
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,020
You know that.

424
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,810
Dale was right.

425
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,540
You don't-- you don't do that.

426
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:19,230
You don't climb all the way up there together just to leave a man behind.

427
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,330
I am being stalked by pregnant women.

428
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,190
You're an obstetrician.

429
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,760
And barren.You know,apparently as a healthy,

430
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,010
successful woman in her 30s,I don't deserve to have a baby.

431
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:35,990
Maybe I'd have a fighting chance if were gay or a teenager or a member of the A.A.R.P.

432
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,080
Oh,that sucks.

433
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,630
It really...

434
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,000
no,Oh,no,not you,too.

435
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,580
Oh,no,no,I'm not.I'm just-- I'm thinking about it.

436
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,930
That's all.

437
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,900
Oh,I don't know.I don't even know.

438
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,700
- It's just that with george going to mercy west next year...
- he is?

439
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,530
Yeah,they havea spot for him,and we need a fresh start.

440
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,600
We need to get away from all this crap.

441
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,870
It might be a good time.

442
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:10,200
It's a great time.

443
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,170
Don't let me and my fossilized eggs discourage you.

444
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,370
Are we gonna be friends still if I get pregnant?

445
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,390
Absolutely not.

446
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,860
- Hi,chief.
- O'malley.

447
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,120
Finally coming to see me about that letter from mercy west?

448
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,130
No,sir.

449
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,600
I'm here about meredith.

450
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,430
I have to say,I don't get it.

451
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:47,600
Why would anybody waste their time freezing and climbing up the side of a glacier?

452
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,910
It's a way to test yourself,you know,your strength and endurance.

453
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:57,570
You put yourself through a situation like that,and you know exactly who you are,what you're made of.

454
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,050
Have you done it before,dr.Burke?

455
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,450
No.You?

456
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,300
I used to,all the time,in college.

457
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,650
- Really?
- really?

458
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,660
Yeah,it's,,intense.

459
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:12,070
I mean,it's painful and hellish,and you think your lungs are shredding,but,

460
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,170
man,when you get to the top,there is nothing like it.

461
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,350
Makes the whole climb worth it.

462
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,160
how's it going?

463
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,300
Worse than I thought.There's nothing here.

464
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,610
We're gonna amputate both?

465
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,000
You can't amputate both of his hands.

466
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,450
I-isn't the left hand less damaged?

467
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,620
I don't want to take the man's hands,dr.Stevens.

468
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:43,650
Once the infection gets that deep,the only way to save his life is to make the cut.

469
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:49,770
the patient's laminotomy happens at what level,dr.O'malley?

470
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:54,500
The level of maximal neural compressions between the pedicles of the fractured vertebrae.

471
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,060
Very good.

472
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,360
You must have aced your exam today.

473
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,000
I don't know about aced.

474
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,920
How did meredith do?

475
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,580
Yeah,she was kinda...

476
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:07,320
don't worry,though.I talked to the chief.

477
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,500
About what?

478
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,890
She didn't tell you?

479
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,860
All right,here's the thing-- the seattle police department's been on this for weeks.

480
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:25,090
They've been in contact with missing persons from all 50 states,canada,the fbi-

481
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,580
- alex-
- you know how many people are trying to find you?

482
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,200
- Yeah,yes.
- That's right.You do know.

483
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,210
You know exactly how many relatives you have.

484
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,710
You know if your parents are dead or alive.

485
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:36,270
You know if you've got a sister somewhere who cries every day because she has no idea what happened to you.

486
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,370
- Stop it.
- What do you think it's like for your husband?

487
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:41,810
He didn't come looking for me,okay?

488
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,160
He obviously doesn't want to find me.

489
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,730
- Besides,it's my life.
- No,not just yours.

490
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,170
What about your daughter?

491
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,360
I'm sorry,but I'm not gonna lie for you.

492
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,020
If you're not gonna tell anybody,I will.

493
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,910
What are you gonna say?

494
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,540
You don't know my real name.

495
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,810
You don't know anything about me.

496
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,700
It'll be my word against yours.

497
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,190
You're right.I have absolutely no idea who you are.

498
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,290
You paged me?Yeah.

499
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,130
Uh,I think I figured out a way to help meredith.

500
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:20,510
But I've got shepherd's post-op,so... I can't do it without your help.

501
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:25,130
And I won't leave the program without,uh,knowing that she's still in it.

502
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,910
You're not leaving the program.

503
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,730
Listen... we made a mistake.

504
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,980
We had sex.

505
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,050
But that's all it was.

506
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:41,710
I think we both wanted it to mean something because...

507
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,290
you didn't want to have to feel like that guy that cheats on his wife,

508
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,900
and I di't want to have to feel like that girl who put you in that position in the first place.

509
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:51,920
But the truth is... it didn't mean anything.

510
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:57,450
I know you think I have feelings for you,but I don'T.

511
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,450
So you can stay.

512
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,030
You're not leaving the program.

513
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,520
nice work...three surgeries at the same time.

514
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:44,680
I performed four osteosyntheses,amputated two hands and stabilized one spine in two hours.

515
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,410
Impressive.

516
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,990
Looks like bailey's not a shoo-in for chief resident after all.

517
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,870
Uh,you're in the running for chief resident,too?

518
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,340
Yeah.

519
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,210
Why wouldn't I be?

520
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,390
No.Uh,it makes sense.

521
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,690
I just... I hadn't thought about it.That's all.

522
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,120
I'm good at what I do,bailey.

523
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:14,850
I'm focused,I'm disciplined,I'm--I'm more than qualified to be chief resident.

524
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:21,910
Look,we all know that you're the chief's favorite,but that doesn't mean I can't take a shot.

525
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,590
Here she is.

526
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,880
thank you,stevens.You can go now.

527
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,320
We'll be waiting right outside.

528
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,340
You don't have to.Shut up.

529
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,990
if you called me here to lecture me--

530
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,220
there's a copy of the intern's exam on the table,

531
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,910
some number 2 pencils,a bottle of water and a sandwich if you get hungry.

532
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,810
I'll send a proctor in,and I'll come back in a few hours and check on you.

533
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,030
You are not my father.

534
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,860
I know that.

535
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,170
I know.

536
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,660
well,at least test day is almost over.

537
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,680
Speak for yourself.

538
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,210
I'm getting married tomorrow.

539
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:12,170
hey.Hey.

540
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,930
This is what you invited me to?

541
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,770
This is your big bachelor party?

542
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,710
It was last-minute.I needed some warm bodies.

543
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,900
Which would explain why I'm here.

544
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,810
Why am I the only girl,by the way?

545
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,630
What am I,the entertainment?I am not stripping.

546
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,860
That's okay.We've seen it already.

547
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,800
- True.I haven'T.
- yeah,

548
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,950
well,why don't I buy you a drink instead?

549
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,260
First round's on me.

550
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,710
I'll give you a hand with those.

551
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,650
Cristina write her vows?

552
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,290
I guess I'll find out tomorrow.

553
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,390
How's meredith doing?

554
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,760
I have no idea.

555
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:50,100
Shouldn't be this difficult,should it?

556
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,620
Probably not.

557
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:57,040
Then again... when I see cristina walking down that aisle tomorrow...

558
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,570
it'll all be worth it?

559
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,280
so how was L.A.?

560
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,960
L.A.Was... different.

561
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:30,120
Look,mark... things don't have to be awkward between us.

562
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,990
We tried.We tried,and we did our best

563
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,000
,and just because we failed as a couple,it doesn't mean--

564
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:40,860
- I know.
- So we're still friends?

565
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,880
With benefits?

566
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,000
Don't push it.

567
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,270
thanks,joe.

568
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,630
So hey,how'd it go with,uh,rina?

569
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:59,300
Oh,well... walter took her to the bus station,

570
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,830
and I'm pretty sure he was wishing it was me he was dropping off.

571
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,740
That bad,huh?

572
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:06,760
If I can't even make it through an ultrasound without breathing into a paper bag,

573
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,470
how am I gonna handle a kid?

574
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,010
Forget about twins.

575
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:13,020
You two are gonna make great parents,okay?

576
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,670
Whenever that happens.

577
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,370
You... ever think about having kids?

578
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,080
All the time.

579
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,340
Adele?

580
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:35,870
Adele.

581
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,790
Oh,come on.I know you saw me.

582
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,000
Now this is just silly.

583
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,600
You don't have to hide.

584
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,200
I've moved on.

585
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,970
I'm dating now.

586
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,780
O-okay,I'm not actually dating,but I intend to... at some point.

587
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,940
What the hell am I supposed to do about the stupid vows?

588
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,410
You still haven't written anything?

589
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,160
- Well,it's stupid crap.
- No,it isn'T.

590
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,470
Well,what am i supposed to say?

591
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:09,600
I swear to love and cherish you every moment of every day of my life?

592
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,980
I mean,that's not real.I mean,that's not how it works,right?

593
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:16,030
It does,at first,but then it... it passes.

594
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,770
No,it doesn'T.

595
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:20,170
You guys are just used to it.That's all.You already have it.

596
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,550
You have that thing everybody else wants.

597
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,090
You can take it for granted.

598
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:27,140
But let me tell you,if you didn't,if you couldn't be with the person that you love,

599
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:34,820
I guarantee that hearing him promise to love you and honor you and cherish you,

600
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,490
no matter what,it would be pretty much all you could think about.

601
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,790
Wait,can you say that again,uh,just slowly?

602
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,640
You're talking about denny,right?

603
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:56,060
Yeah.

604
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,830
Hi.Hi.

605
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,510
Can I buy you a drink?

606
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,750
You're forward.

607
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,630
Bad day.

608
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,350
I get to be forward today.

609
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,150
Yeah,I had a bad day,too.

610
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,810
So what do you say,one drink?

611
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:48,040
Um... I'm with some friends.It's a bachelor party.So I'm gonna... I'm gonna say no.

612
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,320
That's too bad.

613
00:39:55,540 --> 00:40:00,010
Yeah... maybe you're right.

614
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,450
Rebecca pope.

615
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,400
That's my name.

616
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:45,210
Adele!

617
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,770
Adele,come on.

618
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:54,190
Now you've got me in this ladies' room.

619
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,860
The least you could do is an--

620
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:03,760
adele.Oh,my god.

621
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,850
What are you doing here?

622
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,160
Sweetie,get rina some water.

623
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,960
I thought you guys were going to the bus station.

624
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:09,750
We were.

625
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:12,340
It's this heartburn.

626
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,150
It's like it's-- it's ripping through...  oh!

627
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,580
Call an ambulance.

628
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:23,750
Tucker,uh,since he's awake,can you put him on?

629
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,560
let me call you back.

630
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:28,510
Nicole,what have you got?

631
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:32,400
We got the fourth climber.Pressure's 70s,last pulse 135.

632
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:35,150
Severely hypothermic.Started two large-bore I.V.S.

633
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,010
Oh,and,uh,obvious head trauma.

634
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:42,450
Is that an ax in his head?

635
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:47,090
What the hell happened up on that mountain?Let's go.

636
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,790
adele.Somebody help me!Please!

637
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:03,660
Somebody help me!Please!
