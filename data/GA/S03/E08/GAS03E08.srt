1
00:00:00,235 --> 00:00:02,190
Rreviously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:04,492
- This where Georgie lives?
- Oh, George.

3
00:00:04,493 --> 00:00:06,209
O'Malley!

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,453
Callie, she dumped me.

5
00:00:07,454 --> 00:00:09,528
Don't chase me anymore unless
you're ready to catch me.

6
00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:12,502
You erased my name from Burke's
humpty dumpty surgery.

7
00:00:12,503 --> 00:00:14,159
What I don't know is why.

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,601
- You okay?
- Absolutely.

9
00:00:15,602 --> 00:00:18,362
Stop worrying.
Nobody has to know.

10
00:00:18,368 --> 00:00:21,040
I saw you there, at the nursing
home with my mother.

11
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:22,478
She lights up
when you're around.

12
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:24,024
Meredith,
I want to start over.

13
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:25,373
You're not going to retire.

14
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:26,721
I need more time.

15
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:28,420
I don't have
any more time to give.

16
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:30,942
- It's about your dad, George.
- My dad?

17
00:00:36,257 --> 00:00:39,780
<i>Many people don't know
that the human eye has a blind spot

18
00:00:39,785 --> 00:00:41,501
<i>in its field of vision.

19
00:00:41,705 --> 00:00:44,680
<i>There's a part of the world
we are literally

20
00:00:44,688 --> 00:00:45,801
<i>blind to.

21
00:00:45,806 --> 00:00:47,053
What did I say?

22
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:49,123
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

23
00:00:49,318 --> 00:00:52,551
- Seriously.
- Seriously. We're taking it slow.

24
00:00:53,227 --> 00:00:54,540
I can take it slow.

25
00:00:55,115 --> 00:00:56,642
I can take it incredibly slow.

26
00:00:56,646 --> 00:00:58,543
We're taking it slower
than that.

27
00:00:59,218 --> 00:01:00,651
We're starting fresh.

28
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,100
And startign fresh
means no sex because...

29
00:01:03,256 --> 00:01:05,611
Because we started with sex
last time,

30
00:01:05,615 --> 00:01:07,410
and it didn't go very well.

31
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:08,920
Plus, the waiting is fun.

32
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:11,222
And we need fun.

33
00:01:12,046 --> 00:01:14,262
From now on I want to be
bright and shiny.

34
00:01:14,396 --> 00:01:16,000
Bright and shiny, huh?

35
00:01:18,837 --> 00:01:19,862
<i>The problem is,

36
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:21,950
<i>sometimes our blind spots

37
00:01:21,955 --> 00:01:25,583
<i>shield us from things that really
shouldn't be ignored.

38
00:01:26,026 --> 00:01:27,141
Mom.

39
00:01:32,356 --> 00:01:35,133
The nurses tell me
you haven't been eating.

40
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:36,222
No time.

41
00:01:36,227 --> 00:01:40,021
I've been in the O.R. all morning, and I've got
back-to-back surgeries the rest of the day, so...

42
00:01:40,576 --> 00:01:43,481
Look, I'm sorry that I haven't been
visiting, it's just that I've been...

43
00:01:43,487 --> 00:01:45,161
I don't have time
to coddle you right now.

44
00:01:45,547 --> 00:01:46,971
I'm trying to save lives here.

45
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,271
Do you understand?

46
00:01:48,335 --> 00:01:49,213
Do you?

47
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:51,250
Dr. Grey.

48
00:01:51,336 --> 00:01:52,261
Chief.

49
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:53,553
Richard.

50
00:01:57,685 --> 00:01:58,752
For me?

51
00:01:58,755 --> 00:01:59,881
You shouldn't have.

52
00:02:04,178 --> 00:02:06,222
The nurses said
she hasn't been eating.

53
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:08,192
Oh, you wonderful man.

54
00:02:10,017 --> 00:02:10,941
I'm interrupting.

55
00:02:11,106 --> 00:02:13,392
- I'll... I'll go.
- No, chief. Uh...

56
00:02:14,698 --> 00:02:16,311
You stay and I'll go.

57
00:02:17,607 --> 00:02:22,452
<i>Sometimes our blind spots
keep our lives bright and shiny.

58
00:02:26,377 --> 00:02:27,682
Today is the day, people.

59
00:02:27,686 --> 00:02:29,113
Today is the day

60
00:02:29,118 --> 00:02:32,222
when dark-and-twisty Meredith
disappears forever

61
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:34,803
and bright-and-shiny Meredith
takes her place.

62
00:02:36,727 --> 00:02:39,092
You're probably not gonna wanna
be friends with me anymore

63
00:02:39,097 --> 00:02:42,783
because the sheer intensity of my happiness
is gonna make your teeth hurt.

64
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,213
But that's okay
because life is good.

65
00:02:45,335 --> 00:02:47,092
Life is good.

66
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:50,140
What's going on?

67
00:02:50,145 --> 00:02:51,823
George's dad
got admitted last night.

68
00:02:51,827 --> 00:02:54,090
- Oh, my god. Is he okay?
- Oh, no, he's fine.

69
00:02:54,097 --> 00:02:55,561
He, uh, passed out,

70
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:58,211
- hit the floor and fractured his clavicle.
- Yeah, but his clavicle's fine.

71
00:02:58,215 --> 00:02:59,681
Callie said it's gonna be fine.

72
00:02:59,685 --> 00:03:00,790
Are those his A.M. Labs?

73
00:03:00,798 --> 00:03:02,672
Yeah, complaining
of severe abdominal pain.

74
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:04,640
He doesn't have
peritoneal signs. That's good.

75
00:03:04,735 --> 00:03:06,501
Has anybody seen...

76
00:03:07,808 --> 00:03:08,741
I was just looking at it.

77
00:03:08,747 --> 00:03:11,980
Don't you think me reading it
is more important than you reading it?

78
00:03:11,986 --> 00:03:12,850
Sure. Fine.

79
00:03:13,377 --> 00:03:14,633
He's gonna be fine.

80
00:03:15,146 --> 00:03:17,573
You're on scut today.
You'll be distracted.

81
00:03:17,577 --> 00:03:18,283
No, I won't.

82
00:03:18,285 --> 00:03:20,921
Family  members do not treat
family members. Scut.

83
00:03:20,927 --> 00:03:24,220
I'm scrubbing in on a surgery
with Dr. Burke this morning.

84
00:03:24,228 --> 00:03:26,030
Of course you are.

85
00:03:27,688 --> 00:03:31,520
Karev, Sloan. Grey, Pit.
Stevens, shadow Karev.

86
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:34,891
And let me remind you again
of the rules of your probation.

87
00:03:34,898 --> 00:03:36,902
I think she knows the rules,
Dr. Bailey.

88
00:03:37,248 --> 00:03:39,923
No touching patients,
no talking to patients,

89
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:43,033
no rolling your eyes at the patients
or your superiors.

90
00:03:49,926 --> 00:03:52,022
Hey. Good morning, Addison.

91
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:53,580
What's that supposed
to mean?

92
00:03:53,586 --> 00:03:54,573
It is a greeting...

93
00:03:54,576 --> 00:03:57,552
used in civilized cultures
by their civilized inhabitants.

94
00:03:58,798 --> 00:04:00,002
You're smiling.

95
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:01,343
Yeah. It's called happiness.

96
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:02,773
I understand why
you wouldn't recognize it.

97
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,273
Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.

98
00:04:04,657 --> 00:04:07,151
We're, uh, being mature
about this?

99
00:04:07,156 --> 00:04:10,161
Yes, we are going to peacefully coexist
in this hospital,

100
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,551
unless you've reconsidered
moving back to New York.

101
00:04:13,406 --> 00:04:15,300
Okay, then.
We peacefully coexist.

102
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:17,410
- Interesting.
- Yes.

103
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:20,053
We're adults. We're educated.
I think we're capable of many, many things.

104
00:04:20,057 --> 00:04:21,133
Come on.
Let's shake on it.

105
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,801
So I'm still wearing
the rings.

106
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,610
Well...

107
00:04:26,828 --> 00:04:27,981
I think they're stuck.

108
00:04:27,988 --> 00:04:30,563
Have you tried soap?
I hear it's good and slippery.

109
00:04:33,248 --> 00:04:35,431
You are
a very strange person, Derek.

110
00:04:35,435 --> 00:04:38,993
I am just bright and shiny, Addison,
bright and shiny.

111
00:04:40,467 --> 00:04:42,690
No, so then I just... I popped
his shoulder right back in.

112
00:04:42,695 --> 00:04:43,923
He didn't even flinch.

113
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:45,343
Your brother is hard-core.

114
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:46,803
- George?
- Callie, what are...

115
00:04:47,616 --> 00:04:50,023
It looks like you've got
a full house, Mr. O'Malley.

116
00:04:50,026 --> 00:04:51,573
Just waiting on the wife.

117
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:54,471
She's in D.C.,
Uh, chaperoning a field trip.

118
00:04:54,475 --> 00:04:55,732
Yeah, she's coming in today. 

119
00:04:56,035 --> 00:04:58,723
His clavicle's still hurting,
so I added P.R.N. morphine

120
00:04:58,726 --> 00:04:59,642
every four hours.

121
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:02,603
And I've scheduled your
endoscopy for this afternoon.

122
00:05:02,726 --> 00:05:04,232
- An endo-what?
- Scope.

123
00:05:04,245 --> 00:05:06,023
That's like... like a camera.

124
00:05:06,095 --> 00:05:08,683
- That sounds dangerous. Is that dangerous?
- No, it's not dangerous.

125
00:05:08,688 --> 00:05:10,740
Okay, I didn't ask you.
I asked the doctor.

126
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:12,582
Yeah, let the doctor speak, Georgie.

127
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:13,343
White coat.

128
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:14,983
Let's  look at the white coat.

129
00:05:14,987 --> 00:05:17,393
What about an x-ray? 'Cause I had
that once, and I feel like he...

130
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:19,242
- Shut up, both of you. Shut up.
- O'malley.

131
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:20,370
What?

132
00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:25,132
Since we're all...

133
00:05:25,135 --> 00:05:26,733
Well, she's not talking to you.

134
00:05:29,465 --> 00:05:32,751
Ah, excellent.
My invaluable intern.

135
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:36,502
Is it "bring a hot blonde
to work" day? No one told me.

136
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:38,601
Sexual harassment.

137
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:40,863
Dr. Stevens is
shadowing me today, so...

138
00:05:41,438 --> 00:05:43,030
Which one of these cases
do you need us on?

139
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:45,593
It's a really tragic one.

140
00:05:45,726 --> 00:05:47,280
I found out just this morning

141
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:49,181
that I have over two weeks
worth of dry cleaning

142
00:05:49,185 --> 00:05:50,462
that needs to be picked up...

143
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:51,510
Stat.

144
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:54,188
Cool. That's it?

145
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:56,684
See? We're like a well-oiled
machine, you and me.

146
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:59,263
I also need you twoto get me
a sandwich from that

147
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:02,140
pathetic excuse for a deli.
You know the one I like, Karev.

148
00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:03,971
Oh, but go easy
on the mayo this time.

149
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:05,430
I think you're trying
to kill me.

150
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:14,242
I don't see why I can't at least help
with my dad's endoscopy.

151
00:06:14,245 --> 00:06:17,800
What about "no working with family"
do you not understand?

152
00:06:17,818 --> 00:06:19,481
- I'm not asking to do the pro...
- Fine.

153
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:22,103
Pick an intern.

154
00:06:22,827 --> 00:06:23,823
What?

155
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:27,182
I'm being kind. You want an intern
assigned to your dad's case?

156
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,481
Fine.
Who do you want?

157
00:06:29,245 --> 00:06:30,793
Right now.
Pick an intern.

158
00:06:35,965 --> 00:06:36,890
Excellent.

159
00:06:37,145 --> 00:06:40,651
Now we want to place a
partial occluding clamp on the aorta.

160
00:06:42,148 --> 00:06:43,093
Slowly.

161
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:45,903
Good.

162
00:06:45,945 --> 00:06:48,850
Now make sure
all the grafts are de-aired

163
00:06:49,077 --> 00:06:52,320
before you remove the venous
and aortic cannulas.

164
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:57,891
He's letting her decannulate
the heart by herself?

165
00:06:57,898 --> 00:06:59,642
Freakin' unbelievable, huh?

166
00:07:08,047 --> 00:07:09,270
What do we have?

167
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:12,521
Mia Hanson... 5-year-old female,
crush injury to the abdomen,

168
00:07:12,527 --> 00:07:15,791
blunt trauma to the head.
B.P. 90 over 60, pulse 110.

169
00:07:15,796 --> 00:07:18,363
- How was she injured?
- Backed over by her mom's S.U.V.

170
00:07:18,365 --> 00:07:20,401
She's, um...
Her blood type is A-negative,

171
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,511
and she's allergic to penicillin and,
um, wheat.

172
00:07:22,547 --> 00:07:25,513
I am so sorry, Mia.
I am so sorry, baby.

173
00:07:25,518 --> 00:07:29,163
- Has she had anything to eat today?
- Uh, cereal this morning around 6:30.

174
00:07:29,168 --> 00:07:31,430
Okay, Mrs. Hanson, we're going
to take care of your daughter.

175
00:07:31,445 --> 00:07:33,483
I am Mrs. Hanson.
Mia is my child.

176
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:36,260
Anna is just the nanny
who ran over my daughter!

177
00:07:49,397 --> 00:07:51,092
I'm gonna examine your neck, okay?

178
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:53,410
It's okay, Mia.
My name is Meredith.

179
00:07:53,788 --> 00:07:57,090
And Dr. Shepherd and Dr. Bailey
are just trying to see where you're hurt,

180
00:07:57,098 --> 00:07:58,191
- Okay?
- What the hell happened?!

181
00:07:58,197 --> 00:08:00,011
She ran over Mia in the driveway.

182
00:08:00,018 --> 00:08:02,052
- She what?
- Mia wasn't supposed to be

183
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:05,112
in the driveway. Mrs. Hanson told me
to go get some milk, and I...

184
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,061
- I didn't see her.
- How do you not even see a child

185
00:08:08,068 --> 00:08:09,832
- standing in the driveway?
- Shh.

186
00:08:10,058 --> 00:08:11,253
And  where were you?

187
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,230
- What?
- What were you doing that

188
00:08:13,277 --> 00:08:14,490
you couldn't watch Mia
for five minutes?

189
00:08:14,498 --> 00:08:16,582
- I was supposed to be in Court.
- Oh, you're on the phone.

190
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:18,310
I was letting them know
that I was going to be late.

191
00:08:18,316 --> 00:08:21,212
- Instead of watching Mia!
- Oh! Oh, so now this is my fault?

192
00:08:21,215 --> 00:08:22,902
It's the car's fault, okay?

193
00:08:22,907 --> 00:08:25,340
S.U.V.S have blind spots
the size of jupiter.

194
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:28,500
And yelling and fighting and placing blame
is not gonna help your child.

195
00:08:29,438 --> 00:08:32,190
- Is she gonna be okay?
- She has blood in her ear canal.

196
00:08:32,195 --> 00:08:34,163
We need to get her upstairs
for a C.T.

197
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:37,391
- Okay, ready?
- It's gonna be okay, baby girl.

198
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:38,433
Get away from her.

199
00:08:38,845 --> 00:08:40,573
- Now. Get out!
- What?

200
00:08:40,678 --> 00:08:42,131
Come on, let's get her up.

201
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,090
I can't believe you...

202
00:08:48,665 --> 00:08:50,612
You just decannulated a heart
all by yourself.

203
00:08:50,616 --> 00:08:52,223
I didn't decannulate
the heart by myself.

204
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:55,063
I assisted Dr. Burke,
who decannulated a heart.

205
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,261
Why are you being modest? 
Modest looks weird on you.

206
00:08:57,268 --> 00:08:58,572
It's no big deal, George.

207
00:09:00,945 --> 00:09:02,612
How's your father, O'Malley?
Anything new?

208
00:09:03,095 --> 00:09:05,302
He needs an endoscopy,
and, uh,

209
00:09:05,585 --> 00:09:08,703
Bailey won't let me be the intern
on this case. She said I could pick someone.

210
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,590
I was wondering if Cristina
could be the intern on this case.

211
00:09:10,598 --> 00:09:11,982
- Why?
- That shouldn't be a problem.

212
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:16,032
Uh, uh, yes it is. We have a
carotid endarterectomy scheduled at noon.

213
00:09:19,406 --> 00:09:20,361
I'll push it.

214
00:09:20,546 --> 00:09:23,050
-  O'Malley's father deserves the best.
- Thank you, Dr. Burke.

215
00:09:23,058 --> 00:09:24,163
Not a problem, O'Malley.

216
00:09:26,658 --> 00:09:29,473
Your dad better get something
interesting wrong with him real fast.

217
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:31,081
You're sick.

218
00:09:31,106 --> 00:09:31,902
She's a...

219
00:09:31,915 --> 00:09:33,340
sick, horrible person.

220
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:37,470
Tell me again why you put up
with this crap?

221
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:40,403
Because one of these days, he's gonna
crack and let me in on a case.

222
00:09:40,406 --> 00:09:42,223
You sure you want to do
plastics that badly?

223
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:44,390
There you are.

224
00:09:44,398 --> 00:09:46,980
What, did you go all the way
to New York for my pastrami?

225
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,132
Extra spicy, extra lettuce,
light on the mayo.

226
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:49,863
Mark...

227
00:09:50,246 --> 00:09:51,343
What are you doing?

228
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:52,630
Lunch.

229
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:54,011
Want my pickle?

230
00:09:56,206 --> 00:09:58,702
Seattle Grace
is a teaching hospital

231
00:09:58,705 --> 00:10:01,981
and part of your job is to teach.
Your interns aren't your slaves.

232
00:10:02,466 --> 00:10:03,301
Fine.

233
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:05,603
No pickle for you.

234
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:11,812
- Did you see that?
- Hmm?

235
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:16,040
Sloan. He's using his interns
to pick up his dry cleaning and his lunch.

236
00:10:17,398 --> 00:10:18,833
I've got to do an endoscopy.

237
00:10:21,876 --> 00:10:24,463
What  the hell is going on
with the men in this hospital?

238
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:26,252
How you doing, Mr. Jeffes?

239
00:10:26,576 --> 00:10:28,350
Oh, Frank's doing okay.

240
00:10:28,506 --> 00:10:30,990
He'd be doing a lot better
if the twins were even.

241
00:10:31,115 --> 00:10:32,852
Uh, twins?

242
00:10:32,856 --> 00:10:34,421
Frank's new pecs.

243
00:10:35,098 --> 00:10:36,071
Who is Frank?

244
00:10:36,246 --> 00:10:37,301
You're looking at him.

245
00:10:37,926 --> 00:10:39,670
Frank, these are interns.

246
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:42,433
I'm supposed to be teaching them.
Apparently,

247
00:10:42,515 --> 00:10:44,771
this is a teaching hospital.
Karev?

248
00:10:44,915 --> 00:10:46,170
Yeah, uh...

249
00:10:46,277 --> 00:10:49,963
Frank Jeffries is post-op day three
for pectoral enhancement surgery.

250
00:10:50,236 --> 00:10:52,321
There was a slight complication
when a seroma formed.

251
00:10:52,327 --> 00:10:53,510
What is a seroma?

252
00:10:53,516 --> 00:10:55,470
Build up of blood and fluid
under the skin.

253
00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:57,020
Sorry.

254
00:10:57,086 --> 00:10:58,752
And that concludes today's teaching.

255
00:10:59,276 --> 00:11:02,192
A tube was inserted into Mr. Jeffries' chest
to drain the excess fluid.

256
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,490
I want you to monitor him,
check the tube for fluid output

257
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,332
and change his dressings.
Dr. Stevens...

258
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:08,071
I guess you can

259
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:09,361
watch.

260
00:11:10,396 --> 00:11:12,490
Actually, dr. Stevens is
an excellent doctor.

261
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:13,331
Yeah,

262
00:11:13,386 --> 00:11:14,470
that's what I hear.

263
00:11:22,538 --> 00:11:24,121
You decannulated a heart
this morning.

264
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:25,873
- Yeah, I didn't decan-
- Yes, you did.

265
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:28,592
And when Burke and I
were fishing, I...

266
00:11:28,676 --> 00:11:31,251
I noticed something weird
with his hand, like

267
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:33,362
- it had a spasm...
- I'm sorry.

268
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:35,372
Why are you even saying that?
That is not funny.

269
00:11:36,748 --> 00:11:37,941
I didn't say it was funny.

270
00:11:39,006 --> 00:11:41,362
I said it was weird.
And him letting you

271
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:43,250
decannulate a heart,
that's weird.

272
00:11:43,258 --> 00:11:45,911
You should sit with your father. 'Cause if
you want something to worry about,

273
00:11:45,926 --> 00:11:48,202
- you should worry about him.
- My father is fine.

274
00:11:48,385 --> 00:11:49,443
He's good,

275
00:11:49,457 --> 00:11:50,582
I have a good,

276
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,221
Don't... This is Burke.

277
00:11:54,075 --> 00:11:55,360
Did you think that...

278
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:05,402
I want Anna.

279
00:12:05,798 --> 00:12:08,173
It's okay, Mia.
Mommy and daddy are here.

280
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:10,832
and we are just going to take
some pictures.

281
00:12:10,836 --> 00:12:12,670
Okay? This is a big camera.

282
00:12:13,086 --> 00:12:14,673
I don't like it.

283
00:12:14,698 --> 00:12:15,490
Grey...

284
00:12:15,906 --> 00:12:17,061
keep her still.

285
00:12:17,065 --> 00:12:20,142
Mia, baby...
It's okay. Mommy's here.

286
00:12:21,427 --> 00:12:22,791
Where's Anna?

287
00:12:24,296 --> 00:12:26,623
You need to lie very still, okay?

288
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:28,650
I want Anna.

289
00:12:29,826 --> 00:12:31,872
How about I sing you
the good night song?

290
00:12:32,236 --> 00:12:34,231
And you pretend it's bedtime

291
00:12:34,238 --> 00:12:36,370
and stay super still, okay?

292
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,003
Okay.

293
00:12:38,045 --> 00:12:40,331
Good night, Mia

294
00:12:40,437 --> 00:12:42,972
good night, mommy

295
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:45,162
good night, daddy

296
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:48,522
- No, you're singing it wrong.
- I am? I'm singing it wrong?

297
00:12:49,877 --> 00:12:51,451
I want Anna.

298
00:12:51,457 --> 00:12:53,520
She's in the waiting room, honey.
I'll, I'll get her.

299
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:54,450
John!

300
00:12:56,055 --> 00:12:58,101
Let's all sing it together, okay?

301
00:12:58,108 --> 00:13:00,653
No. I want Anna.

302
00:13:05,926 --> 00:13:07,943
So now... but you pick...
you pick a car.

303
00:13:07,947 --> 00:13:09,281
Okay. Um...

304
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:13,701
1968 mustang gt
390 fastback.

305
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,641
That's interesting.

306
00:13:16,106 --> 00:13:18,690
No, that is hot.
That is very hot.

307
00:13:19,738 --> 00:13:20,902
Car.

308
00:13:23,226 --> 00:13:24,401
Hey, Georgie.

309
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:25,281
How's dad?

310
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:27,281
Fine. They're not done yet,
but I'm sure he's fine.

311
00:13:27,286 --> 00:13:28,700
Can I talk to you,
Dr. Torres?

312
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:29,620
Sure.

313
00:13:30,257 --> 00:13:31,083
Excuse me.

314
00:13:34,027 --> 00:13:35,281
What are you doing?

315
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:37,752
- I'm talking to your brothers.
- You don't have to do that.

316
00:13:37,756 --> 00:13:38,780
It's okay. I don't mind.

317
00:13:39,377 --> 00:13:41,571
I'm pretty sure Ronny and Jerry
both have a thing for me.

318
00:13:41,726 --> 00:13:45,072
I was gonna go with Jerry
until he went all 1957 bel-air.

319
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:46,773
- I was like, "really?"
- Thank you

320
00:13:46,776 --> 00:13:50,082
for trying to help out with my family,
but it's really not necessary.

321
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,351
George...

322
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:55,111
I'm kidding about your brothers.
Come on.

323
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:56,651
Callie, I'm serious.

324
00:13:56,655 --> 00:13:58,320
I can handle my family
on my own.

325
00:13:58,327 --> 00:13:59,760
You broke up with me,
remember?

326
00:14:29,065 --> 00:14:31,530
We may have to do
a partial nephrectomy.

327
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:33,963
Do you think
you can save Mia's kidney?

328
00:14:33,975 --> 00:14:37,051
Only if we can control the bleeders.
Here, cauterize as I go.

329
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,343
Thank you.

330
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:40,923
You poor baby.

331
00:14:40,928 --> 00:14:43,170
It's not gonna be an easy recovery.

332
00:14:43,256 --> 00:14:44,883
Well, with parents like that,

333
00:14:44,887 --> 00:14:46,950
she didn't have it easy
to begin with.

334
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:49,092
People do the best they can,
Dr. Grey.

335
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,173
They don't know
their kid's blood type.

336
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,462
They don't know her favorite song.

337
00:14:54,177 --> 00:14:56,572
People want high-powered careers,
I get that,

338
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:59,730
but they should think twice
before having kids.

339
00:15:02,156 --> 00:15:04,693
Oh! I... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...

340
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:06,822
What, that I should be home
with my baby

341
00:15:06,827 --> 00:15:09,512
instead of here with this little girl
and a surgical intern

342
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:11,350
who can't cauterize the bleeders?

343
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:13,770
- Dr. Bailey...
- If I were you, Dr. Grey,

344
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:17,090
I would keep my eye on the surgical area
and my mouth shut.

345
00:15:27,986 --> 00:15:29,321
O'Malley.

346
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:30,593
How's it going with your dad?

347
00:15:30,606 --> 00:15:33,332
Good. The chief's doing an endoscopy
on him, so he's in good hands.

348
00:15:33,336 --> 00:15:35,123
That was an amazing surgery this morning,

349
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,923
the way you let Cristina
decannulate that heart.

350
00:15:36,957 --> 00:15:39,671
She shows tremendous promise
in cardiothoracic surgery.

351
00:15:39,867 --> 00:15:41,352
She said she didn't do it.

352
00:15:42,987 --> 00:15:44,620
Probably didn't want
to rub it in.

353
00:15:44,766 --> 00:15:45,952
Make anyone jealous.

354
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,572
We're talking about Cristina.

355
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:50,523
Everything all right 
with you?

356
00:15:51,545 --> 00:15:52,331
Sure.

357
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:53,590
It's fine.

358
00:15:54,598 --> 00:15:57,091
'Cause if anything ever wasn't,
you know you could talk to me, right?

359
00:15:58,488 --> 00:16:00,351
You've been through a lot lately,
getting shot...

360
00:16:01,048 --> 00:16:02,393
All that...
It can't be easy.

361
00:16:03,617 --> 00:16:04,363
Yeah.

362
00:16:06,926 --> 00:16:08,510
Has it not been easy?

363
00:16:10,145 --> 00:16:11,233
It's  fine.

364
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,773
- Send my best to your dad.
- Okay.

365
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:19,742
- Hey.
- Hey.

366
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,052
This civil and mature thing,
how far does it go?

367
00:16:22,057 --> 00:16:23,233
Meaning what?

368
00:16:23,308 --> 00:16:26,230
Meaning is it pleasantries in the hallway,
or do we actually interact?

369
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,090
Oh, I don't know.
That sounds drastic.

370
00:16:28,097 --> 00:16:30,350
I'm worried about Richard.
He seems down to me.

371
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:33,140
Well, he's separated from his wife.
That usually doesn't make a person giddy,

372
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:35,313
except in my case.

373
00:16:35,408 --> 00:16:37,122
I think he could use somebody
to talk to.

374
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:39,472
- So talk to him.
- No, I think we both should.

375
00:16:39,478 --> 00:16:41,812
You know, so it's clear that
he has people to turn to.

376
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:43,141
Because he's a little depressed?

377
00:16:43,157 --> 00:16:45,260
Well, because I don't think
he's spoken to Adele in weeks,

378
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:47,982
and he's our friend, and
he has always been there for us.

379
00:16:47,985 --> 00:16:51,511
When you get divorced, doesn't that mean
your wife is supposed to stop nagging you?

380
00:16:51,705 --> 00:16:53,492
Maybe if you took the rings off
it would help.

381
00:16:53,707 --> 00:16:55,802
Are you gonna come with me
to see the chief or not?

382
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,063
Fine. Yes. Okay.

383
00:16:57,107 --> 00:16:59,433
Thank you. Let's do it.
And I will try soap.

384
00:16:59,657 --> 00:17:01,413
- For the rings, I mean.
- Okay.

385
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:09,542
Oh, yeah.

386
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:11,222
That's what I'm talking about.

387
00:17:11,228 --> 00:17:13,062
Oh, look at you.

388
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:16,090
Do they still look lopsided?

389
00:17:16,178 --> 00:17:17,452
I mean, from the seroma.

390
00:17:17,457 --> 00:17:19,530
No, it looks like most of
the swelling has gone down.

391
00:17:19,535 --> 00:17:20,323
Yeah?

392
00:17:20,515 --> 00:17:21,943
Oh, yeah.

393
00:17:22,356 --> 00:17:23,182
Hey, uh,

394
00:17:23,185 --> 00:17:25,291
Dr. Stevens, would you
take a look at the twins?

395
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,811
Frank would like
a woman's perspective.

396
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:29,013
You're just looking.

397
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,382
Nice.

398
00:17:33,436 --> 00:17:35,523
It looks pretty even to me,
very defined.

399
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:37,343
And the redness should go away
in a couple of days.

400
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:38,203
Good.

401
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:39,411
Good.

402
00:17:39,787 --> 00:17:41,313
Frank got them for his girlfriend.

403
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:42,971
He doesn't want her to see 'em
till their perfect.

404
00:17:43,456 --> 00:17:45,242
Your girlfriend asked you
to get pec implants?

405
00:17:45,245 --> 00:17:46,053
Oh, no. No, no.

406
00:17:46,057 --> 00:17:49,273
Frank's girlfriend joined a gym,
got a trainer named Lars.

407
00:17:49,665 --> 00:17:51,123
What kind of name
is that, Lars?

408
00:17:51,588 --> 00:17:54,993
So you got fake pecs 'cause you're jealous
of a guy with a fake name?

409
00:17:55,518 --> 00:17:56,361
Well, uh,

410
00:17:56,477 --> 00:17:58,561
my last girlfriend Veena...

411
00:17:58,637 --> 00:18:01,852
left me for a guy with hair
so I got plugs...

412
00:18:01,857 --> 00:18:02,991
too late.

413
00:18:03,128 --> 00:18:05,321
This time around, Frank's not
taking any chances.

414
00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:07,501
Frank sees the signs of discontent,

415
00:18:07,695 --> 00:18:09,301
Frank's fighting back.

416
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,712
Oh, yeah.

417
00:18:10,996 --> 00:18:11,822
I don't know.

418
00:18:11,827 --> 00:18:14,003
I just don't get the whole
fake boob thing, no offense.

419
00:18:14,007 --> 00:18:15,410
Oh, these are, these are
top of the line.

420
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:17,333
I mean, they... they look real,
they

421
00:18:17,407 --> 00:18:18,753
feel natural.

422
00:18:19,117 --> 00:18:20,072
No, really.

423
00:18:20,187 --> 00:18:21,443
Feel 'em.

424
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:22,391
Really.

425
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,220
Come on. Feel them.

426
00:18:27,726 --> 00:18:28,820
Very solid.

427
00:18:28,828 --> 00:18:29,733
And real.

428
00:18:29,918 --> 00:18:32,043
- I don't know about that.
- Well, compare them to his.

429
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:34,611
- I'm not involved with this.
- Come on.

430
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:35,692
Don't be such a baby.

431
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:42,821
This...

432
00:18:43,965 --> 00:18:45,763
this is why
I don't work with interns.

433
00:18:50,398 --> 00:18:51,592
Mrs. Hanson.

434
00:18:52,275 --> 00:18:53,092
Is she all right?

435
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:55,313
Yes, we were able
to stop the bleeding.

436
00:18:55,316 --> 00:18:58,373
Dr. Shepherd has ordered
an M.R.I. of her skull fracture.

437
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,143
Hopefully she won't need
any more surgery.

438
00:19:00,145 --> 00:19:02,270
- Oh, thank god!
- Uh, she's in recovery.

439
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,402
- Dr. Grey will take you up to her.
- Thank you.

440
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:07,612
Can we wait just a minute? My husband
went downstairs to use a landline.

441
00:19:07,627 --> 00:19:09,462
- His battery died.
- Sure.

442
00:19:09,465 --> 00:19:10,200
So

443
00:19:10,437 --> 00:19:11,643
Mia, she's okay?

444
00:19:11,647 --> 00:19:12,983
Oh, she is.

445
00:19:13,316 --> 00:19:14,223
Yeah.

446
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,081
She, um...

447
00:19:16,946 --> 00:19:20,081
keeps asking, uh, for Anna.

448
00:19:20,885 --> 00:19:21,913
We fired Anna.

449
00:19:22,357 --> 00:19:23,202
Oh.

450
00:19:24,307 --> 00:19:26,903
She just seems
very attached to her.

451
00:19:26,908 --> 00:19:27,913
That's my fault,

452
00:19:27,945 --> 00:19:30,133
according to my husband,
because I'm a working mother.

453
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:33,130
He's a working dad, but apparently,
that's not the issue.

454
00:19:33,408 --> 00:19:34,752
I love my job.

455
00:19:35,585 --> 00:19:37,021
I love Mia more.

456
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:39,710
She is my baby.
She's my...

457
00:19:42,376 --> 00:19:43,761
I love my daughter

458
00:19:44,168 --> 00:19:45,480
and I love my job.

459
00:19:45,616 --> 00:19:47,652
I'm not good at the mom stuff,
but

460
00:19:47,655 --> 00:19:49,321
I'm good at my job.

461
00:19:52,636 --> 00:19:56,442
Why bother having a kid if you're only
gonna see it on weekends and holidays?

462
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,913
You might as well just get a cat.

463
00:19:57,917 --> 00:19:59,580
I talked to Burke.
I think he's fine.

464
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:00,973
You did what?

465
00:20:01,146 --> 00:20:02,381
What's wrong with Burke?

466
00:20:02,397 --> 00:20:03,892
Nothing's wrong with anybody.

467
00:20:03,896 --> 00:20:06,122
Do you know he let her
decannulate a heart this morning?

468
00:20:06,136 --> 00:20:08,771
You decannulated a heart
this morning, by yourself?

469
00:20:09,978 --> 00:20:10,822
Bitch.

470
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:12,490
No, not by myself.

471
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:13,690
Now she's lying about it.

472
00:20:13,706 --> 00:20:16,830
Yang decannulated a heart.
Why is Alex not surprised?

473
00:20:17,328 --> 00:20:18,661
Izzie isn't either.

474
00:20:18,665 --> 00:20:22,013
Last week, Izzie was digging through crap.
This week, she's fondling man-boobs.

475
00:20:22,307 --> 00:20:24,351
No decannulating hearts
for Izzie.

476
00:20:24,355 --> 00:20:26,351
Why aren't you bragging about
decannulating a heart?

477
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,663
- I didn't decannulate the heart.
- Izzie and Alex do not believe you.

478
00:20:30,066 --> 00:20:31,661
Okay,
what are you two doing?

479
00:20:31,776 --> 00:20:34,991
Izzie and Alex have a patient who
speaks about himselfin the third person.

480
00:20:34,995 --> 00:20:37,211
They thought it was annoying at first,
but now they kind of like it.

481
00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:39,160
Good. Is it gonna stop soon?

482
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:40,673
Wow, what happened?

483
00:20:40,676 --> 00:20:43,483
This morning you were all "bright and shiny"
and asking to be kicked in the face.

484
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:44,511
I am.

485
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:45,850
I'm bright.

486
00:20:45,857 --> 00:20:46,900
I'm shiny.

487
00:20:46,908 --> 00:20:47,771
Yeah.

488
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:51,602
Izzie thinks this whole
bright and shiny thing is getting old.

489
00:20:51,608 --> 00:20:52,911
Alex agrees.

490
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,621
We think you're depressed.

491
00:20:56,186 --> 00:20:57,793
- Both of you?
- Yes.

492
00:20:57,797 --> 00:21:01,303
Well, for the two of you to agree
on something, I must damn near be suicidal.

493
00:21:01,306 --> 00:21:03,212
- We agree on things.
- We agree on this.

494
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:04,061
So...

495
00:21:04,548 --> 00:21:05,562
Start talking.

496
00:21:11,077 --> 00:21:12,290
Adele and I...

497
00:21:12,808 --> 00:21:14,850
She wants me to step down as chief,

498
00:21:15,345 --> 00:21:16,111
retire.

499
00:21:16,118 --> 00:21:17,732
You, retire? That's crazy.

500
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:18,652
What would you do?

501
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:20,791
Uh, spend a little more time
with his wife, perhaps?

502
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:22,500
- She's being unreasonable.
- She wants to know that

503
00:21:22,505 --> 00:21:25,310
- his marriage is a priority to him.
- She's using his work as an excuse.

504
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:28,373
Or he is. Some men use work.
Some men use other women.

505
00:21:28,378 --> 00:21:30,550
- Some women use other men.
- I've been visiting Ellis Grey.

506
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:32,852
I was lonely, and you had checked out
and I was lonely.

507
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,242
I work, I visit Ellis.
That's my day.

508
00:21:35,247 --> 00:21:37,650
- You gave up on us first. I was there.
- I make time for Ellis.

509
00:21:37,655 --> 00:21:40,053
- I don't make time for Adele.
- There's something driving a wedge

510
00:21:40,057 --> 00:21:42,680
between Richard and Adele.
Now maybe you don't see it, but I do,

511
00:21:42,686 --> 00:21:44,242
- and so does Adele.
- Maybe he sees it

512
00:21:44,248 --> 00:21:45,950
- and doesn't want to do anything about it.
- He's gotta do something about it.

513
00:21:45,957 --> 00:21:48,080
That's what marriage is built on, change.

514
00:21:48,088 --> 00:21:49,493
Change is what keeps marriage alive.

515
00:21:49,507 --> 00:21:50,741
The man has a right to do whatever
he wants to do...

516
00:21:50,745 --> 00:21:52,021
- Stop...
- Sorry.

517
00:21:52,287 --> 00:21:53,040
helping me.

518
00:21:54,517 --> 00:21:56,021
Look, I miss my wife.

519
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:58,043
I want her back.

520
00:21:59,795 --> 00:22:01,781
I don't want my marriage
to be over.

521
00:22:01,835 --> 00:22:02,791
Richard...

522
00:22:03,835 --> 00:22:06,523
your marriage isn't over
until you decide it is...

523
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,653
- Right.
- Until you decide that the...

524
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:12,153
the sacrifice just isn't worth it.

525
00:22:12,156 --> 00:22:13,081
Right.

526
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:16,032
Come in.

527
00:22:16,216 --> 00:22:17,121
Oh, Yang.

528
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,001
What is it?

529
00:22:23,196 --> 00:22:24,233
O'Malley.

530
00:22:24,238 --> 00:22:25,232
Yeah.

531
00:22:26,758 --> 00:22:28,521
I have your father's

532
00:22:28,727 --> 00:22:29,722
test results.

533
00:22:36,608 --> 00:22:38,300
You gotta ask for it.

534
00:22:38,585 --> 00:22:40,851
Hey, we've been waiting here forever.
Where's the doctor?

535
00:22:40,856 --> 00:22:42,963
Uh, Dr. Webber will be in
in a couple of minutes.

536
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:44,561
Won't tell you anything, huh,

537
00:22:44,705 --> 00:22:46,321
not till you're a real doctor?

538
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,522
I am a real doctor.

539
00:22:48,527 --> 00:22:49,653
Ronny!

540
00:22:51,956 --> 00:22:53,863
I just...
I'm just not dad's doctor.

541
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,272
What is it, Georgie?

542
00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:00,923
Let's just wait for Dr. Webber.

543
00:23:04,177 --> 00:23:06,382
No, I think
he's expecting you to tell him.

544
00:23:06,757 --> 00:23:09,930
- But he's coming. He said he's coming.
- He's coming in later. You should...

545
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:12,510
- I mean, you should tell your dad.
- What's with the whispering?

546
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:23,533
The biopsy results were abnormal.

547
00:23:27,418 --> 00:23:30,403
Well, is abnormal bad or...

548
00:23:30,948 --> 00:23:32,733
just different?

549
00:23:36,018 --> 00:23:37,070
Georgie?

550
00:23:50,406 --> 00:23:51,541
Sir...

551
00:23:52,426 --> 00:23:55,012
you have cancer
in your esophagus,

552
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:56,582
which has spread
to your stomach.

553
00:23:57,015 --> 00:23:58,781
We need to operate
to remove it,

554
00:23:58,785 --> 00:24:01,612
and you'll need to undergo
chemotherapy and radiation.

555
00:24:02,915 --> 00:24:03,892
I'm sorry.

556
00:24:26,085 --> 00:24:27,771
They're gonna try
to operate soon.

557
00:24:27,786 --> 00:24:29,022
This week, I think.

558
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:31,742
It's a stage 3

559
00:24:32,665 --> 00:24:34,112
metastatic cancer.
So...

560
00:24:36,788 --> 00:24:39,551
And my... my brothers...

561
00:24:41,945 --> 00:24:45,090
And, uh...
Callie slept with Sloan.

562
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,703
I just can't...

563
00:24:50,045 --> 00:24:51,160
I can't...

564
00:24:52,495 --> 00:24:55,351
I can't deal with...
with any of it.

565
00:24:55,487 --> 00:24:57,351
I spent the entire day worrying
about Burke, like

566
00:24:57,468 --> 00:25:01,040
there was something wrong with him.
But there's nothing wrong with Burke and...

567
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:07,051
God, my dad has cancer,
I can't even look him in the face.

568
00:25:07,348 --> 00:25:09,020
Cristina had to tell him

569
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,251
wh-what was wrong.

570
00:25:13,415 --> 00:25:14,141
Cristina.

571
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:21,560
Nobody gets it right
with their own family.

572
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:23,523
I certainly don't.

573
00:25:24,387 --> 00:25:25,623
Yeah.

574
00:25:26,146 --> 00:25:27,171
Yeah...

575
00:25:28,436 --> 00:25:30,241
Callie slept with Sloan?

576
00:25:31,647 --> 00:25:33,480
I don't get you people.

577
00:25:35,007 --> 00:25:36,690
Us with the boobs?

578
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:39,780
- We make a lot of bad decisions.
- Yeah.

579
00:25:45,655 --> 00:25:46,540
Dude,

580
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,003
I still can't believe you
went through all this for a chick.

581
00:25:49,385 --> 00:25:51,362
What, you never did
anything crazy for love?

582
00:25:51,647 --> 00:25:52,741
Not like this.

583
00:25:53,067 --> 00:25:54,060
You have a girlfriend?

584
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:54,791
No.

585
00:25:55,976 --> 00:25:57,192
Dr. Stevens?

586
00:25:57,946 --> 00:25:59,571
Frank can sense the vibes.

587
00:25:59,578 --> 00:26:01,290
I'm not talking about this
with you.

588
00:26:01,386 --> 00:26:03,212
What, she left you for another guy?

589
00:26:06,008 --> 00:26:07,110
Frank's hit a nerve.

590
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:08,870
It's more complicated
than that.

591
00:26:09,245 --> 00:26:11,033
Uncomplicate it then, man.

592
00:26:12,727 --> 00:26:14,822
Grand gestures is what
I'm talking about.

593
00:26:14,957 --> 00:26:17,832
Be like Frank. Just figure out
what she wants and make it happen.

594
00:26:18,067 --> 00:26:19,803
Just forget all about
the other guy.

595
00:26:19,806 --> 00:26:21,002
Trust Frank.

596
00:26:21,386 --> 00:26:22,592
Frank knows.

597
00:26:26,438 --> 00:26:27,622
Hey, what do we got?

598
00:26:27,748 --> 00:26:31,041
The second M.R.I. Report
shows bleeding in Mia's brain.

599
00:26:32,445 --> 00:26:33,351
Damn it.

600
00:26:33,737 --> 00:26:34,951
I need to go in,

601
00:26:35,146 --> 00:26:36,810
try to relieve the pressure.

602
00:26:37,106 --> 00:26:39,250
- Two surgeries in one day?
- But she's tough.

603
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:41,490
And right now we don't have
any other options.

604
00:26:41,926 --> 00:26:43,042
Here.

605
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:45,463
Not so bright and shiny.

606
00:26:54,088 --> 00:26:56,422
I thought the cancer
was in my gut.

607
00:26:56,768 --> 00:26:58,510
What are we looking
at my heart for?

608
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:00,672
Your E.K.G. showed some abnormalities,

609
00:27:00,675 --> 00:27:02,941
so we just want to make sure
your heart's healthy enough

610
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:04,601
to support you
through the surgery.

611
00:27:09,947 --> 00:27:11,221
You're a smart girl.

612
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:13,701
Yes.

613
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:18,063
George told me you were the best intern
I could have on my case.

614
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,163
He said that?

615
00:27:20,218 --> 00:27:22,600
He said you were the best intern
in the hospital.

616
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,572
Said you keep everyone
on their toes,

617
00:27:25,876 --> 00:27:27,022
even him.

618
00:27:27,816 --> 00:27:28,820
Dr. Yang,

619
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:30,633
you should take a look
at this.

620
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:51,751
You paged me?

621
00:27:53,037 --> 00:27:54,351
What is Burke doing
in there?

622
00:27:54,356 --> 00:27:55,760
I did a pre-op echo.

623
00:27:56,306 --> 00:27:57,752
His aorta valve is leaking.

624
00:27:57,758 --> 00:28:00,530
He won't make it through the cancer surgery
unless we replace it.

625
00:28:02,526 --> 00:28:04,973
It's just
a valve replacement, George.

626
00:28:05,046 --> 00:28:06,200
It's gonna be fine.

627
00:28:06,738 --> 00:28:07,873
Burke will do it.

628
00:28:11,578 --> 00:28:13,753
Burke will do it, and
you will clear his schedule.

629
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:17,043
If someone is gonna operate
on my dad's heart, I want it to be Burke.

630
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:19,191
- Yeah.
- Okay.

631
00:28:20,258 --> 00:28:21,400
It's gonna be fine.

632
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,443
It's a valve replacement.
It's Preston Burke.

633
00:28:23,446 --> 00:28:26,072
If someone's gonna cut your
dad's heart apart, you want it to be him.

634
00:28:28,825 --> 00:28:29,633
What?

635
00:28:38,336 --> 00:28:40,522
- What's wrong with Burke's hand?
- Nothing.

636
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:44,182
- He's gonna operate on my father.
- George, Burke is fine.

637
00:28:44,186 --> 00:28:46,692
- Your dad will be fine.
- You're lying.

638
00:28:47,286 --> 00:28:49,153
Burke is hiding something,
and you're helping him.

639
00:28:49,158 --> 00:28:50,822
Leave me alone.

640
00:29:01,725 --> 00:29:02,662
You wanted to see me, chief?

641
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,301
It's about your mother.

642
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:13,623
Um...

643
00:29:14,408 --> 00:29:17,402
I... I know your relationship
with her is, uh...

644
00:29:18,606 --> 00:29:19,890
complicated.

645
00:29:20,497 --> 00:29:23,281
And I know you know that
she and I...

646
00:29:23,285 --> 00:29:24,361
- were...
- Chief,

647
00:29:24,865 --> 00:29:25,800
it's okay.

648
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:29,061
What really matters
is that you make her happy,

649
00:29:29,906 --> 00:29:31,422
and my father couldn't

650
00:29:31,616 --> 00:29:34,463
- and I couldn't, so...
- Meredith, I...

651
00:29:36,988 --> 00:29:38,642
I can't see your mother
anymore.

652
00:29:40,386 --> 00:29:42,000
I need to make...

653
00:29:43,556 --> 00:29:46,550
I need to try to make
my marriage work.

654
00:29:47,217 --> 00:29:48,812
And if I'm gonna do that...

655
00:29:51,047 --> 00:29:52,931
I have to stop seeing
your mother.

656
00:29:54,355 --> 00:29:55,263
I see.

657
00:29:55,925 --> 00:29:56,802
She...

658
00:30:00,628 --> 00:30:02,390
She's an extraordinary woman.

659
00:30:03,575 --> 00:30:07,181
She worked so hard,
she sacrificed so much, and to see it

660
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:09,520
end like this,

661
00:30:14,678 --> 00:30:16,070
Take good care of her
for me.

662
00:30:22,015 --> 00:30:23,203
We got it from here.

663
00:30:23,206 --> 00:30:24,023
Yo.

664
00:30:24,696 --> 00:30:27,362
Okay, Frank.
Time to take the tube out.

665
00:30:30,565 --> 00:30:31,691
Izzie,

666
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,201
- put on some gloves.
- What's going on?

667
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:34,391
Alex, what are you doing?

668
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:36,062
You ready to take out
Frank's boob tube?

669
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:38,441
What about the rules?
What if Sloan finds out?

670
00:30:38,447 --> 00:30:39,223
Screw Sloan.

671
00:30:39,227 --> 00:30:40,573
She knows
what she's doing, right?

672
00:30:40,677 --> 00:30:43,142
I promise you, Frank, the twins
are in excellent hands.

673
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:46,510
Grand gesture.

674
00:30:47,037 --> 00:30:47,883
Frank gets it.

675
00:30:47,937 --> 00:30:48,861
What's he talking about?

676
00:30:48,865 --> 00:30:49,831
Nothing.

677
00:30:49,876 --> 00:30:50,852
You sure about this?

678
00:30:50,856 --> 00:30:52,421
Oh, yeah, he's sure.

679
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:07,053
Looks like we can
safely evacuate the clot.

680
00:31:07,525 --> 00:31:08,811
Want to cook the pumper?

681
00:31:16,455 --> 00:31:18,331
Did you ever think about
having kids?

682
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:22,171
Derek and I talked about it,
but I wasn't ready.

683
00:31:22,488 --> 00:31:23,622
I love kids.

684
00:31:23,977 --> 00:31:25,191
I'd have a dozen.

685
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:27,282
Believe me, one's enough,

686
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,400
unless you plan
to put away your scalpel.

687
00:31:30,037 --> 00:31:31,621
That's why
god invented nannies.

688
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,623
I wish it were that easy.

689
00:31:35,117 --> 00:31:36,333
What do I do with these,

690
00:31:36,717 --> 00:31:38,081
hock 'em, keep 'em?

691
00:31:38,227 --> 00:31:40,713
My mom says post-divorce
wedding rings are bad juju.

692
00:31:40,717 --> 00:31:42,833
- Your mom says juju?
- She does.

693
00:31:43,648 --> 00:31:44,432
So,

694
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:47,193
what would your mom do?

695
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:49,312
Burn 'em

696
00:31:49,497 --> 00:31:50,552
bury 'em.

697
00:31:51,475 --> 00:31:52,400
You want 'em?

698
00:31:53,627 --> 00:31:56,243
I want some rings,
just not bad juju rings.

699
00:31:56,266 --> 00:31:58,302
Then again, my mom's kind of insane.

700
00:31:58,306 --> 00:32:00,132
Hey, don't talk smack about your mom.

701
00:32:00,597 --> 00:32:01,683
Miranda.

702
00:32:03,508 --> 00:32:04,493
Yesterday,

703
00:32:04,847 --> 00:32:06,182
I left

704
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,780
for work early,

705
00:32:08,155 --> 00:32:11,383
and Tuck's favorite food
was strained peas.

706
00:32:11,385 --> 00:32:15,192
Nasty green gunk, but he loved them,
ate them for breakfast.

707
00:32:15,276 --> 00:32:20,482
I got home after a 15-hour shift,
and he doesn't like strained peas anymore.

708
00:32:20,488 --> 00:32:22,261
He only wants carrots.

709
00:32:23,476 --> 00:32:25,381
Life moves so fast.

710
00:32:26,118 --> 00:32:29,113
- Everybody moves on.
- Yep.

711
00:32:32,057 --> 00:32:32,921
Where you going?

712
00:32:33,306 --> 00:32:34,891
I'm not ready to move on.

713
00:32:47,745 --> 00:32:50,132
Do you know why I picked you
to be my dad's intern?

714
00:32:51,897 --> 00:32:53,423
Because you are a robot.

715
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:56,262
You're a freakin' robot in a white coat
who never makes a mistake,

716
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:58,840
and most of the time, I appreciate that.
Most of the time,

717
00:32:59,235 --> 00:33:02,451
I really feel like I have something
to learn from you. But right now,

718
00:33:03,616 --> 00:33:04,563
right now,

719
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:08,591
I need you to try, just for a minute,
I need you to try to be a human being.

720
00:33:23,446 --> 00:33:25,190
Thank you, Alex.

721
00:33:25,578 --> 00:33:27,342
I can't believe you let me help.

722
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:32,422
Alex is cool, you know that?
Alex is the coolest.

723
00:33:32,426 --> 00:33:33,932
Oh, Alex knows it.

724
00:33:34,408 --> 00:33:37,090
- Izzie isn't so bad herself.
- No, Izzie is rocking.

725
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:39,301
Izzie is back in the game.

726
00:33:45,196 --> 00:33:46,430
I can't.

727
00:33:47,445 --> 00:33:49,023
Alex, I'm sorry.
I can't.

728
00:33:57,196 --> 00:33:58,411
Hey, Mia.

729
00:33:59,726 --> 00:34:01,550
Can you say something
for me?

730
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,643
I need to hear
how great you talk.

731
00:34:07,326 --> 00:34:10,842
Can you say my name?
Can you say Meredith?

732
00:34:11,755 --> 00:34:12,881
Wh-where's...

733
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:14,153
Anna?

734
00:34:15,497 --> 00:34:17,131
That was great.

735
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:19,140
Guess who's here.

736
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,992
Mom and dad.

737
00:34:22,157 --> 00:34:23,351
Hey.

738
00:34:25,145 --> 00:34:26,921
How's my baby girl, huh?

739
00:34:27,256 --> 00:34:28,882
I want Anna.

740
00:34:28,896 --> 00:34:30,112
Anna.

741
00:34:35,776 --> 00:34:37,282
Diane, wait.

742
00:34:37,286 --> 00:34:38,732
Diane, where are you going?

743
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,881
So we'll do the thing
with the heart tomorrow?

744
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:44,091
Maybe tomorrow.

745
00:34:44,285 --> 00:34:45,970
Uh, maybe in a couple of days.

746
00:34:45,976 --> 00:34:47,303
I don't, I don't know
quite yet.

747
00:34:47,937 --> 00:34:51,353
But, uh, Dr. Webber and Dr. Burke said
we should get to it quick.

748
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:53,793
And we will get to it
as quick as we can.

749
00:34:54,238 --> 00:34:55,703
I just want to make sure

750
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:56,891
that we do it right.

751
00:34:57,575 --> 00:35:00,382
I just don't understand why
they're operating on his heart

752
00:35:00,616 --> 00:35:01,750
when the cancer

753
00:35:01,758 --> 00:35:02,762
is in his gut.

754
00:35:03,465 --> 00:35:04,891
Yeah, it's complicated.

755
00:35:05,948 --> 00:35:07,243
You know what I was thinking?

756
00:35:07,277 --> 00:35:08,522
Maybe the tests are wrong.

757
00:35:09,206 --> 00:35:10,730
Okay? Maybe it's not cancer.

758
00:35:11,428 --> 00:35:13,672
'Cause, 'cause, 'cause cancer
runs in the family, right?

759
00:35:13,677 --> 00:35:15,641
And no one else in the family
has cancer.

760
00:35:16,045 --> 00:35:17,093
It is cancer.

761
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:19,562
Okay? It's stage 3 metastatic

762
00:35:19,946 --> 00:35:22,092
- esophageal cancer.
- Meta-whatic?

763
00:35:22,716 --> 00:35:23,822
Metastatic.

764
00:35:24,286 --> 00:35:25,182
It's, uh,

765
00:35:25,296 --> 00:35:28,300
when the cancer cells have migrated
from their point of origin...

766
00:35:28,307 --> 00:35:31,420
Okay, you're talking doctor now, George.
Just talk english.

767
00:35:31,426 --> 00:35:33,310
I am talking english,
you're just not listening!

768
00:35:33,318 --> 00:35:35,241
No, you're just not saying
anything that we understand!

769
00:35:35,245 --> 00:35:36,601
Boys.

770
00:35:39,378 --> 00:35:40,921
Imagine your dad's like a...

771
00:35:40,925 --> 00:35:43,230
like a vintage car, okay?
And, uh...

772
00:35:43,747 --> 00:35:45,312
his blood's like

773
00:35:45,318 --> 00:35:46,960
gas flowing through the fuel lines.

774
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:50,182
The cancer cells are like the gunk
that builds up in there.

775
00:35:50,187 --> 00:35:52,322
- And fouls up, fouls up the plugs.
- Exactly.

776
00:35:52,928 --> 00:35:56,412
Once the gunk starts circulating, it can do
a lot of damage to the whole engine.

777
00:35:56,418 --> 00:35:57,902
The carburetor, everything.

778
00:35:59,228 --> 00:36:01,730
It's... it's like the engine
had already blown a gasket

779
00:36:03,017 --> 00:36:06,053
even before
all the other damage started.

780
00:36:17,818 --> 00:36:19,911
Good night, mummy,

781
00:36:19,915 --> 00:36:22,293
it's time
to say good night

782
00:36:22,798 --> 00:36:25,202
good night, Mia...

783
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:26,650
good night

784
00:36:26,655 --> 00:36:28,913
<i>When it comes to our blind spots...

785
00:36:29,268 --> 00:36:31,983
daddy,
it's time to say goodnight.

786
00:36:31,986 --> 00:36:34,123
<i>maybe our brains aren't compensating.

787
00:36:36,377 --> 00:36:38,163
<i>Maybe they're protecting us.

788
00:36:42,937 --> 00:36:44,253
I'm glad you came to visit.

789
00:36:47,557 --> 00:36:48,732
But you can't stay.

790
00:36:48,765 --> 00:36:50,272
I'm expecting someone.

791
00:36:53,298 --> 00:36:54,411
Actually...

792
00:36:54,815 --> 00:36:56,371
mom, he's not coming.

793
00:36:58,456 --> 00:36:59,332
What?

794
00:36:59,555 --> 00:37:00,851
The chief.

795
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,202
Richard.

796
00:37:02,327 --> 00:37:04,041
He's not coming tonight.

797
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:08,650
It's... in fact, it's just gonna
be me for a while.

798
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:15,221
- He's gone back to Adele.
- Yes.

799
00:37:15,228 --> 00:37:16,650
Of course he has.

800
00:37:19,098 --> 00:37:20,050
Mom...

801
00:37:21,288 --> 00:37:22,443
He's afraid,

802
00:37:23,686 --> 00:37:25,093
afraid to be happy.

803
00:37:25,815 --> 00:37:27,080
And I'm all alone.

804
00:37:29,735 --> 00:37:31,802
Now I have to raise
my daughter alone.

805
00:37:33,715 --> 00:37:35,560
How am I expected
to do that?

806
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:38,853
Mom...

807
00:37:43,827 --> 00:37:45,813
You did the best you could.

808
00:37:47,205 --> 00:37:50,051
You did the best you could.
That's all anybody

809
00:37:50,418 --> 00:37:51,483
can do.

810
00:38:01,957 --> 00:38:03,140
How am I looking?

811
00:38:04,237 --> 00:38:06,951
Good. You're ready
for surgery.

812
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:09,512
That's good, I guess.

813
00:38:12,215 --> 00:38:15,583
I don't know how I'm gonna
tell my wife about all this.

814
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:17,360
40 years, we've been

815
00:38:18,025 --> 00:38:19,392
married,

816
00:38:19,405 --> 00:38:20,772
and now...

817
00:38:20,777 --> 00:38:22,913
cancer and a heart condition?

818
00:38:25,227 --> 00:38:26,521
She was always

819
00:38:26,528 --> 00:38:28,511
telling me
how I should eat better

820
00:38:29,097 --> 00:38:30,663
and take better care
of myself.

821
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:36,063
I guess I should have listened.

822
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:45,202
George...

823
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:46,520
is the best.

824
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:47,382
What?

825
00:38:48,455 --> 00:38:49,500
He's the best...

826
00:38:49,918 --> 00:38:50,932
intern.

827
00:38:53,127 --> 00:38:54,163
He's a good doctor

828
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:55,632
and he's a good person,

829
00:38:55,648 --> 00:38:56,350
and

830
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:59,140
whatever happens,
I just thought you should know that.

831
00:38:59,988 --> 00:39:01,480
that you raised a good person.

832
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:09,330
Thank you, Dr. Yang.

833
00:39:28,935 --> 00:39:31,222
I didn't know you still felt
that way about me.

834
00:39:31,858 --> 00:39:33,001
Me neither.

835
00:39:35,075 --> 00:39:36,093
I can't.

836
00:39:37,756 --> 00:39:38,872
I'm sorry.

837
00:39:41,305 --> 00:39:42,511
Alex gets it.

838
00:39:43,498 --> 00:39:45,342
Alex is sorry
he's such an idiot.

839
00:39:47,448 --> 00:39:49,190
Can Izzie buy Alex a drink?

840
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:51,670
Alex would like that.

841
00:39:51,678 --> 00:39:52,833
Izzie can.

842
00:39:55,766 --> 00:39:57,313
I know what time it is.

843
00:39:57,316 --> 00:39:59,570
I don't care if he's sleeping,
just wake him up.

844
00:40:00,846 --> 00:40:03,442
He could sleep late.
No, wake him up.

845
00:40:05,798 --> 00:40:06,770
Okay.

846
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:08,612
Now.

847
00:40:09,848 --> 00:40:11,622
No, uh, put the phone
to his ear.

848
00:40:12,308 --> 00:40:13,673
Hey.

849
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:15,353
Hey, tuck.

850
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:17,803
It's mommy.

We can be dull
