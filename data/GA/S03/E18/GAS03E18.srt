1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,690
previously on "grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,050
I'm getting married to burke.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:05,980
Ouch.

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,860
I went to the board this morning and told them I was retiring.

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,280
One of us could be chief.

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,680
We were here long before you and george started fooling around.

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,700
- He is my husband.
- Stop saying that like it means something.

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,760
jane doe,about six months pregnant.
Found under a pile of rubble.

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,220
She can't remember anything from before the accident.

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,030
Go 60 days with no sex,no other women.

11
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,530
- My mother's dead,isn't she?
- Yes.

12
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,740
Why didn't you stay and fight for us?

13
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,420
I-I tried.

14
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,580
Alex,I'm sorry.
I can'T.

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,140
people have scars in all sorts of unexpected places,

16
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,380
like secret road maps  of their personal histories,

17
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,460
diagrams of all  their old wounds.

18
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,350
Alex!
God.

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,270
Yeah,yeah,yeah.
Seen it all before.

20
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,970
What the hell are you doing here?

21
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,420
- Moving in.
- What?

22
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,770
Most of our old wounds heal,leaving nothing behind  but a scar.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,210
But some of them don'T.

24
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,720
Alex is moving in?
To this house?

25
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,950
- He's taking george's room.
- Why?

26
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,230
I was asleep just a minute ago.

27
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,950
Yeah.And I was naked in the bathroom when alex walked in.

28
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,650
I'm lucky I didn't come out of the shower
to find him peeing all over the seat.

29
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,700
And we're up.

30
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,490
What's wrong with where he was living before?

31
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,470
- I don't know where he was living before.
- Probably a whorehouse.

32
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,440
I can't have him living in the room right next door.
It's weird.

33
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,850
People are what matters.

34
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,700
Alex is one of our people.
We can't leave him out in the cold.

35
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,160
"People are what matters"?
You don't like people.

36
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,170
- Is this about your mother?
- No.

37
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,390
I had a near death whatever,and...

38
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,940
I was dead.
And now I'm not.

39
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,020
So I'd like to use this chance
I've been given to be more positive.

40
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,780
People are what matters.

41
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,460
Paint with all the colors of the wind.

42
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,820
Oh.
Okay.

43
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,660
You're crazy now.

44
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,590
- I'm alive.
- Yeah,okay.

45
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,440
No,no.
Um,I'm not done in there yet.

46
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,670
Oh,don't worry.
Not looking,not interested.

47
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,310
Some wounds we carry  with us everywhere,

48
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,980
and though the cut's  long gone...

49
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,160
no,she's selfish,is izzie's problem.

50
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,250
The pain still lingers.

51
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,480
She's not selfish.
She's generous.But...

52
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,520
she--
she's self-absorbed.

53
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,840
I mean,her problem is that she doesn't see other people's perspectives.

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,920
Hey,give me a bite.

55
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,540
You know,it's weird because she's so ridiculously compassionate with her patients.

56
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,380
You'd think she'd roll some of that out for her friends,

57
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,610
- how about we not talk about her anymore?
- but not the way--

58
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,890
That's a fine idea.

59
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,650
He is in george's room,
and when george's stupid marriage crashes and burns,

60
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,190
he's gonna want to move back in,and he won't be able to.

61
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,410
His life will be in a shambles,
he'll finally notice that his dad is dead

62
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,040
and he made a fool out of himself
by marrying somebody he doesn't really love,

63
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,720
and he'll have no place to go.
Is that what you want?

64
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,930
That's exactly what I want.

65
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,100
- Hey,look who found some clothes.
- Shut it.

66
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,390
How you doing?

67
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,670
Okay,everybody,let's do this once.

68
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,570
I'm fine,she's cremated,I picked out a beautiful urn,

69
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,590
and she's hanging out in the back of my closet.

70
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,610
Any more questions about my dead mother,or can we get back to work?

71
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,590
does anyone know who the new chief candidate is?

72
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,050
The chief's bringing in a ringer in case
he doesn't want to give the job to either of your boyfriends.

73
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,670
O'malley,you're with shepherd today.

74
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,510
Yang,Dr. Montgomery.
Stevens,to the clinic.

75
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,060
Karev,jane doe.
Grey,scut.

76
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,020
Once again,I am fine.

77
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,030
You can tell everybody you fine till you're blue in your face.

78
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,220
Your mom died,and you almost joined her.

79
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,320
You're taking it easy.

80
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,630
Anybody come looking for me yet?

81
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,510
Well,no match on your prints,no.
No hits from missing persons,plus--

82
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,140
my face is hard to identify.

83
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,090
Well,the second they find something out about your identity,
I'm gonna come tell you.

84
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,000
Dr. Sloan says I need surgery on my eye.

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,700
Well,he just wants to make sure you don't lose vision there completely.

86
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,890
But Dr. Montgomery says I should wait a day or two 'cause of the baby.

87
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,540
I don't know what I'm supposed to make of that.

88
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,480
Yeah,well,I mean,surgery can be hard on a baby,
but you're gonna be on a fetal monitor the whole time,

89
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,820
so if anything goes wrong,we'll catch it.

90
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,990
Thank you.

91
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,140
I really--
I really appreciate you taking the time to...

92
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,450
I mean,you're--
you're all I've got in this place.

93
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,440
does that hurt?

94
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,460
Of course it hurts.
Don't poke it like that.

95
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,170
Has the lump been there a long time?

96
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,570
I got shot 50 years ago.
It's been there a long time.

97
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,420
But it hasn't bothered you till...
recently?

98
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,920
It bothers me there's a bullet in there.

99
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,690
It'd bother you,too,
but it didn't start hurting till a couple of months ago.

100
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,880
You think it's a bullet?

101
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,900
I don't "think," lady.
I know.

102
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,960
I wanted it out,but the army doctors didn't want to go get it.

103
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,010
So they let me keep it in for half a lifetime.

104
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,380
Well...

105
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,330
let's get some pictures,see if you're right.

106
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,120
I know I'm right.
Save your film.

107
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,700
Just get me something for the pain.

108
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,490
Mr. Scofield,I'm sure you are right,
but we're still gonna do this my way.

109
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,400
- Derek.
- There she is.

110
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,020
How was your flight?

111
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,310
They didn't feed me,which I don't understand.

112
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,530
Dr. O'malley,Dr. Crawford.
She's a big pain in the ass.

113
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,820
- Pleasure.
- He says that because we worked together in new york,

114
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,110
and I was the only one who never had a crush on him.

115
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,280
No,I-I don't buy that.

116
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,350
What do we know,o'malley?

117
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:22,410
Dr. Crawford has a parafalcine meningioma along
the superior sagittal sinus.

118
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,900
You've operated three times.
It keeps on coming back.

119
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,030
Yeah,it's in dangerous territory,so we leave a little bit of
the tumor behind each time,

120
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,430
and we go back every couple of years and,uh,tune it up.

121
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,700
But this is the last time.

122
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,130
- Sorry?
- This is it,derek.

123
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,160
I'm done after this.

124
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,140
Helen...

125
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:45,170
the recovery takes forever,and it's not like when jake was around.

126
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,290
I go through this by myself now.

127
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,030
Don't throw in the towel.

128
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,720
I'm looking at the situation as it is.

129
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,110
I am going to do this now,

130
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:59,070
then I am going to spend
the next two years of my life lying on a beach,

131
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,840
enjoying the sun.

132
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,650
- Helen...
- stop looking at me like I killed your cat.

133
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,140
The decision is made.

134
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,200
You guys seen bailey?

135
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,710
- What are we doing?
- checking out the new chief candidate.

136
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,450
chief's in with the ringer.
We're lurking in a way that was subtle when it was two of us,

137
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,410
- but isn't now that it's 12.
- I heard it was someone from stanford.

138
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,420
All the professors there loved me.

139
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,050
- They loved you?
- I was a great student.

140
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,250
- how you doing,grey?
- Oh,I'm fine,sir.Thank you.

141
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,470
- move,move,move.
- She doesn't like it when people ask.

142
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,900
The ringer's in there with the chief.

143
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,990
Yeah,and whoever it is loves cristina
because everyone at stanford  just loved cristina.

144
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,460
- Shut up.
- She's a motivated student.

145
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,430
- That's nothing to be ashamed of.
- Thank you.

146
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,460
A bit of a kiss ass,but that's hard to control.

147
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,500
oh,they're coming out.
Look away.

148
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,930
that's colin marlowe.

149
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,790
like the marlowe transplant?

150
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,930
Like the brightest thing in cardiothoracic surgery in a generation.

151
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,080
Uh,Dr. Marlowe...

152
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:06,200
I'm,uh,preston burke.
I'm a great admirer of your work,sir.

153
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,360
- Uh,particularly the--
- yes,thank you.I--

154
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,570
would you excuse me for just a second?

155
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,510
Well...

156
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,020
you gonna give me a hug or what?

So what was that,exactly?

161
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,960
He was my professor.
We were close.

162
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,630
Well,"close" appears to be something of an understatement.

163
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,460
It was a long time ago.

164
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,850
I talk about him all the time.
You never thought to mention it?

165
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:54,140
Well,um,I didn't think you wanted to hear about every guy I ever slept with.

00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,830
I have a hysterectomy to prep.

167
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,820
Are we done with the curiosity?

168
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,530
Great.

169
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,980
What are you doing tonight?

170
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,560
'Cause I don't want to go home and find alex there,
and it's just the two of us,you know?

171
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,700
And it's weird and awkward,
and he doesn't know whether he should talk to me or not talk to me.

172
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,020
it's just such an awkward situation.

173
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,570
I'd rather it be group awkwardness,you know?

174
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,080
I don't want to just be standing there staring at him.

175
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,020
Meredith?

176
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,700
- Hey,have you seen montgomery?
- No.

177
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,170
Hey!What are you doing tonight?
You want to come over?

178
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,680
'Cause you and I never really get a chance to hang out and...

179
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,140
it might be kind of fun.
Alex just moved in,which was meredith's brilliant idea.

180
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,530
And he still has a thing for me,so it'S...
what the hell?

181
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,880
This is my hiding spot.
My father is out there.Go somewhere else.

182
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,920
- I need this closet,meredith.
- Colin marlowe?

183
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,730
Yes,he was my professor.
We were close.

184
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,980
He had his hand on your ass.
I sure hope you were close.

185
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,790
Did you see somebody go in there?

186
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,850
I did.
Someone's hiding from me.

187
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,860
Yes,I think someone's hiding from me,too.

188
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,170
You were that girl,huh?
The girl who slept with the professor.

189
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,500
We had one in my class.
She only got to the radiologist,though.

190
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,380
No one got near  the cardio god.

191
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,210
Yeah,yeah,yeah.I scored big.
You know,hide in the bathroom.

192
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,080
My awkwardness with my father is well-established.

193
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,560
You and the cardio god,on the other hand,have loads to catch up on.

194
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,060
But I don't want to talk to the cardio god.

195
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,970
you know we can hear you in there,right?
Loud and clear.

196
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,970
oh.
Hi.

197
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,930
Hi.

198
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,720
- Excuse me.May I?
- Yeah.

199
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,600
- Oh,I was just leaving,actually.
- We heard about your mother.

200
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,890
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

201
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,910
There wasn't a funeral or anything?

202
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,940
Oh,she didn't want that.

203
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,390
I hope everything's okay with the baby.

204
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,950
Oh,we're not here with the baby.
We're here because we wanted to make sure that you were all right.

205
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:42,090
Oh,well,that's sweet,but we don't have to do this.
I'm not in shock.

206
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,520
I'm not racked with grief.
I'm just moving on.

207
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,420
But you're hiding in a broom closet.

208
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,760
Well,if you could just move my father...

209
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,290
I sent him to go get some coffee,but we'd really like to...

210
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,300
you know,make dinner or something...
for you.

211
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,460
He's been really worried about you.

212
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,680
And he's the family you have left,meredith.

213
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,280
I-I don't see it that way.

214
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,590
Oh,when is this gonna stop?

215
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,640
Yes,he made some mistakes,but he's not a monster.

216
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,030
He's just...

217
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:13,230
an inarticulate person who spills food on his shirt,a lot.

218
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,070
Have dinner with us,tonight.

219
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,840
I'll make some chili.
The whole thing will be over in an hour.

220
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,110
You think you can do that?

221
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,080
I can't believe you hid in a closet when you saw me coming.

222
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,000
If it wasn't just tragic,it might be the most adorable thing I've ever seen.

223
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,790
You could've warned me.

224
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,570
I thought,cristina yang wouldn't hide in a closet
'cause she doesn't want to talk to me,

225
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,970
which clearly she doesn't
because she fled like a roach in sunlight when she saw me coming.

226
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,580
You know,I did not flee.
I was--I have work to do.

227
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,710
I'm not a professional note taker anymore.

228
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,070
You grew your hair.
It's lovely.

229
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,320
Don't flirt with me.
I have a person.

230
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,880
Really?
Who?

231
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,670
Preston burke.

232
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,030
you never change.
Must be adorable.

233
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,500
No.Shut up.
It is a real relationship.

234
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,530
- I bet it is.
- I'm marrying him.

235
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,970
Oh...

236
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,650
good.

237
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,540
Congratulations.

238
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,870
No,I'm being genuine.

239
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,690
It's wonderful.

240
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,370
can I give you a congratulatory hug?

241
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,580
Don't touch my ass.

242
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,550
My stomach is growling.

243
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,840
Sorry.
We can't let you eat before the surgery.

244
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,390
That's okay.
I stayed at the archfield last night.

245
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,630
I had them make me breakfast at midnight.

246
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,050
You should try the french toast.
It'll blow your mind.

247
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,910
Breakfast at the archfield on an intern's salary?

248
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,350
Yeah,I kinda live there at the moment.
My wife has a deal there.

249
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,820
That's one hell of a deal.

250
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,730
So our room service bill at the archfield,is that part of the deal?

251
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:43,600
Yeah,sure.

252
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,000
I mean,breakfast alone is,what,probably 50 bucks a day?

253
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,870
And they still only charge us $400 a week?

254
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,910
Sometimes I pay them more for room service.

255
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,450
Okay.Well,then just tell me how much it is,
and we'll split it like we do the rest.

256
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,780
- Don't worry about it,george.
- No,come on.

257
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,730
I'm not gonna have you pay for all the food.
Just tell me how much the room service bill is.

258
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,920
We pay about,mm,800 a week.

259
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,540
Dollars?
I told you not to worry about it.

260
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,050
- You can't afford that.
- yes,I can.

261
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,210
How?

262
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,980
I'm your husband now.
You're supposed to tell me this stuff.

263
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,770
Okay.
Just come here.

264
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,030
All right,my parents have a lot of money...

265
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,150
- what?
- And so I...

266
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,160
have more money than I'm making.

267
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,130
And we don't have a special deal through family friends at the archfield.

268
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,020
- I just--I pay for it.
- How much?

269
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,150
$2,500 a week.

270
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,980
- You're an heiress.
- Okay.

271
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,300
- See,this is why I don't tell people.
- You're an heiress.

272
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,420
- No,stop talking.
- You're an heiress?

273
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,810
Don't-- just don't,okay?
Stop talking.Stop talking.I mean it.

274
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:41,000
I-I didn't tell you because my parents' money
has affected every single relationship in my life,

275
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,620
and so I've stopped talking about it and living it--

276
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,710
no,wait,wait.So wait.
So I've been--

277
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,140
I've been paying you $200 a week for what,fun?

278
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,060
no.
I use it to tip housekeeping.

279
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,610
Great!
Oh!

280
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,140
Oh,I'm--
you know,I'm glad I could pitch in.

281
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:04,020
You know,is there anything else that I should know about that's,
I don't know,huge like this?

282
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,600
Uh,I-I-I used to have a pet ferret for nine years.

283
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,360
George...
great.

284
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,330
Stop distracting the staff.

285
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,510
You're pushy.
Anybody ever tell you that?

286
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,190
um,so what do you think of a sagittal sinus bypass?

287
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,420
Have you ever scrubbed in on a sagittal sinus bypass,Dr. O'malley?

288
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,200
No.

289
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,550
It is what they call "big balls" surgery.

290
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,580
- Apparently I have a surgeon with--
- it's been very successful.

291
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,090
When the patient doesn't stroke out.

292
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,080
If it works,the tumor's all gone.
We never have to go back in there again.

293
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,520
- If it doesn't work,I'm dead.
- If you refuse to come back in two years,you're dead anyway.

294
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,800
- That's a decision I can live with.
- That isn't a decision  i can live with.

295
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,210
O'malley,go find her labs.

296
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,890
So what do you think,huh?

297
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,650
A few years on a beach,and then what?

298
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:58,970
After you piss away your savings,your memory goes,

299
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:02,480
motor skills deteriorate,and you're dying a very slow,

300
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,840
- miserable,painful death...
- derek--

301
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,800
you're gonna call me up and you're gonna ask me
why we didn't do something when we had the chance.

302
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,500
Now that is not something I can live with,

303
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:16,250
not when we can do something right now to prevent it.

304
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,890
Well,it looks like the bullet has damaged your scapula.

305
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,600
No wonder it hurts.

306
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,470
How did you get shot,sir?

307
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,130
Korea.Garden spot.
Makes a nice vacation.

308
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,340
Can I get a damn painkiller?

309
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,950
I think we'll do you one better.
We're gonna take it out.

310
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:33,980
My bullet?

311
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,630
there was no reason to remove it
when you first got hit,but now it's infected.

312
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,500
It's working its way into your scapula,and we can't have that.

313
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,130
- I need to see that bullet.
- You gonna frame it?

314
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,100
No,smarty-pants.
I was fragged a couple of weeks before it all ended.

315
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,000
- "Fragged"?
- yeah,shot by one of his own men.

316
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,080
I made a decision,and they didn't like it.
And then what do you know?

317
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,790
We're facing enemy fire,and I take a hit from the wrong side of the line.

318
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,270
I could never prove it,but we can prove it now

319
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,170
when you pull the damn thing out of me.

320
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,360
- Get me my bullet.
- Let's calm down,Mr. Scofield.

321
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,650
Do you know what it's like when your own men turn on you?

322
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,860
It's not a good feeling.

323
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,380
I just agreed to have dinner at my father's house,tonight.

324
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,360
And cristina slept with colin marlowe.

325
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,090
"Marlowe transplant" marlowe?

326
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,040
They had a thing when she was a student.
How could I have a meal at my father's house?

327
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,740
- He slept with cristina?
- Derek.

328
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,670
Oh,right.
Sorry.Okay.

329
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,450
Um,have dinner at your house.

330
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,550
It's your place.
I'll come.

331
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,860
I'll be your wingman.
It'll be fun.

332
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,840
Okay,it won't be fun.
But it'll be...it'll be fine.

333
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,540
- They're your family.
- Why does everyone assume that?

334
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,580
You deserve to have a family,whether you like them or not.

335
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,910
I thought we had a deal.

336
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,230
We agreed I wouldn't sleep with anybody for two months.
We never said I wouldn't look.

337
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,460
- You didn't think I'd hold out.
- No,I didn'T.

338
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,100
- You're worth it.
- You bet your ass I am.

339
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,100
She's rich,totally rich,boatloads of money.

340
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,100
- George,that's fantastic.
- No,it'S...

341
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,960
it's not fantastic.

342
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,480
cristina did colin marlowe.

343
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,210
Callie's rich.

344
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,880
- Don't talk to her about it.
- "Her"?

345
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,250
- I'm sorry,I don't have a name anymore.
- "Don't tell anyone.¡± Those were my words.

346
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,690
- So--so she's rich.
- Just shut up about it.

347
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,190
Do you think that's possible?

348
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,900
If you give me the "people is what matters" thing again,
I will kill you.

349
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,530
Colin marlowe.

350
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,510
Was it good?
Was he good?

351
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,250
Did he make you a better lover?

352
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,800
Remember all the other times I've talked to you about my sex life?

353
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,930
No.
Exactly.

354
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,590
Did I miss anything about her doing the old guy?

355
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,300
- She's not talking.
- Oh,she'll talk.

356
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,610
So I was supposed to be back in the game today,
but instead I'm planning dinner for my father in my dead mother's house.

357
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,360
I don't cook.
How am I supposed to cook for them?

358
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,000
I will make your stupid dinner.

359
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,930
So were there any little blue pills involved,or is he untouched by time?

360
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,480
Dude,that's just wrong.
Don't answer that.

361
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,720
Because I am your friend,I will show up at
your house 45 minutes into the dinner with a fake crisis.

362
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,550
So if it's,uh,unbearable,you can abort.

363
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,620
Oh,thank you.

364
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,640
Come on.
He's not a young man.

365
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,680
He wasn't getting a little help?

366
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,180
Poppin' the pill?
Dad's best friend?

367
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,620
Come on.
You're gonna give me nothing after everything we've been through?

368
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,630
Nothing?

369
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,220
It's a miracle drug.

370
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,340
And someday,it'll save your life.

371
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,520
Ah,Dr. Marlowe?
Rek shepherd.

372
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,500
I'M doing a sagittal sinuspass today if you'd like to observe.

373
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,990
Really?
That's quite a procedure.

374
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,140
Well,it's a good trick,but if you're really interested to see
what this hospital can do,

375
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,570
I'm performing an arterial switch operation for a T.G.A.
This afternoon.

376
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,860
If you gentlemen are trying to intimidate the competition,
it's working.

377
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:44,970
Good.

378
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,180
I'll see both of you in surgery.

379
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,160
Colin marlowe.

380
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,310
The one and only.

381
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,560
- He...
- yes.

382
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,810
- With...
- yes.

383
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,520
- Wow.
- Indeed.

384
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,710
Yeah.

385
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,260
Suction.

386
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,870
No,not like you're driving a tractor.

387
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,070
Slowly.

388
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,310
Better.

389
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,600
What's the chance she wakes up and remembers everything?

390
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,210
I wouldn't count on it.

391
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,980
Dr. Sloan,the baby's having decels.

392
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,780
Are you sure?
Sometimes the monitor's not on right.

393
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,950
You get a false read.

394
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,910
She's got vaginal bleeding.
The baby's in distress.

395
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,580
- Oh,damn it.
- Page Dr. Montgomery.

396
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,560
Now!

397
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,900
you're making an honest woman of cristina yang.

398
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,210
That's--

399
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,290
that's impressive.

400
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,810
I always thought she was collecting us,like baseball cards.

401
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,200
Baseball cards?

402
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,670
Well,she likes an authority figure,someone with something to teach her.

403
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,620
But I never thought she would actually commit.

404
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:37,430
She use to say to me that she thought that marriage was for the weak and undirected.

405
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,360
I made a number of marriage proposals.

406
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:45,060
It seemed the polite thing to do after such a long time together,

407
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,250
but,uh,she wouldn't have it.

408
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,320
All what time?

409
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,910
You were just having a fling with a student.

410
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,030
A fling?

411
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,830
Cristina and i were together for three years.

412
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,560
Is the problem that I slept with my professor,

413
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,660
or that I was committed enough to keep at it for three years?

414
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,930
Oh,no.
You told him that you thought marriage was an idiotic institution.

415
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,260
- It is.
- Then why did you say yes?

416
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,640
- Because I want to make you happy.
- "Happy"?

417
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,720
You know,I'll do a lot of things to make you happy.

418
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,940
Do I give a crap about a ceremony with a dress and a flautist?

419
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,990
No.

420
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,530
But I'm happy to do it if it'll make you happy.

421
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,580
Heartwarming.

422
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,010
Thanks.

423
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,640
you couldn't have waited one day?

424
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,300
She was 40% vision compromised in her right eye.
It would've been gone tomorrow.

425
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,380
No,it wouldn't,actually,

426
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,290
but there's a snazzy new chief candidate marching around the hall today,

427
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,790
and you needed to be a hero.
That's what needed to happen today.

428
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,520
The patient was fine,addison.

429
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,940
The baby's still in her uterus,and she's not losing an eye.

430
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,820
Every surgery is risky.

431
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,660
The patient chose this one.

432
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,870
Karev...
don't just stand there.

433
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,990
The patient's baby was in distress.

434
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,530
Go.
Stay with her.

435
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,620
Something happen with jane doe?

436
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,770
Yeah,she can see,and addison's got a problem with it.

437
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,570
He rushed her into surgery,and she almost lost the baby.

438
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,820
I had to sew  her cervix shut.

439
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,020
The complications had nothing to do with the surgery.

440
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,030
And why?
Why do you think mark moved so quickly,derek?

441
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,690
Do you think it's because a piece of
the orbital bone was floating towards the brain?

442
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,180
Well,I think it's because mark wants a promotion.

443
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,720
You're not her husband.
This isn't your patient.

444
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,730
Stay out of it!

445
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,750
What the hell do you people think you're doing?

446
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,910
You're supposed to be the leadership of this hospital.

447
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,970
Screaming about a patient in the hallway?

448
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,010
Are you out of your minds?

449
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,870
- tough procedure.
- Mm-hmm.

450
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,220
It's a bold choice.

451
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,080
We've been fighting this one for a while.

452
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,380
I'm hoping this will be the end of it.

453
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,380
what h happened?

454
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,220
end-tidal c0-2 just dropped from 30 to 16.
Bagging manually.

455
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,720
Doppler's showing air in the left ventricle.

456
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,170
0-2 stat's down to 89.

457
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,230
aspirate the central line.

458
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,870
- She's bradycardic.
- Push 1 of atropine.

459
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,960
There's no air in the central line.

460
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,720
All right,level her out.
I'm gonna flood the field.

461
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,110
asystole.
Push 1 milligram of epi.

462
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,460
Start compressions.
Go.

463
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,150
Get in there.
Get in there! Do it!

464
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,610
That things been in there since the korean war?

465
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,940
He's lucky it didn't travel down to his aorta.

466
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,060
Okay,a little suction there.

467
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,850
Almost...

468
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,350
I got it.

469
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,220
make sure we get that back.
The patient wants it.

470
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,270
He's got a warped sense of nostalgia.

471
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,290
Hmm,I get it.

472
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:18,190
If they pulled a bullet out of me,
I'd want it cast in gold and mounted on my wall.

473
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,050
Yeah,well,you can afford it.

474
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,160
just a little more suction.
Let's get ready to close.

475
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,380
she's not responding.

476
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,780
- I'm gonna open her up.
- Open cardiac massage?

477
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,300
You're a neurosurgeon.

478
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,510
You have no privileges in this hospital.
Get the glasses off.

479
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,430
- Should we page Dr. Burke?
- No,I've got it.

480
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,640
Cross clamp the hilum.
You don't want air in the cerebral arteries.

481
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,260
Yeah,I got it.
Give me a 10-blade.

482
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,080
10-blade quickly,please.
O'malley,get over here.

483
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,810
Let's roll her.Ready?
One,two,three.Go.

484
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,010
Okay,rib spreader.

485
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,500
okay,scissors.

486
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,810
Massage her heart,o'malley.

487
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,680
I need to aspirate.

488
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,060
any air return?

489
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,500
10 cc'S.

490
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,370
end-tidal c0-2 is going back up.

491
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,040
the heart's starting to beat on its own.

492
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,580
Pressure's 60 over 40.
It's low,but it's there.

493
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,340
She's gonna make it.

494
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,040
should I start closing her up?

495
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,490
Dr. Shepherd?

496
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,590
O'malley,I just sliced my friend's chest open.
Give me a moment.

497
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,010
that was very well-handled,Dr. Shepherd.

498
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,360
Very impressive,indeed.

499
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,860
Not something I want to do every day,but thank you.

500
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,140
What happened?

501
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,100
Dr. Shepherd's patient had a venous air embolism.

502
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,800
He had to split her chest open,massage her heart

503
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,830
and manually aspirate right in the middle of his procedure.

504
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,200
Why didn't you call me?

505
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,440
- Uh,you were operating.
- I was next door.You could've pulled me out.

506
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,450
There was no time.
I handled it.

507
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,350
You think I crack people's heads open if you're in the building

508
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,370
- just because I think I can handle a brain bleed?
- The patient is fine.

509
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,430
- The patient is lucky,and you were showboating.
- Showboating?

510
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,230
What,are you out of your mind?
I was--

511
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,400
we seem to be going out of our way to impress Dr. Marlowe.

512
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,380
- I'll bet we are.
- Gentlemen...

513
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,080
good day,doctors.

514
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,980
How you feeling,Mr. Scofield?

515
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,640
Where's my bullet?

516
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,390
that it?

517
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,490
Where's the rest of it?

518
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,420
That was it.

519
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,030
Is that a letter?

520
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,680
Can you read that?

521
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,680
I-I don't think it's much of anything.
I-I think it's just a scratch.

522
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,560
It's so small.

523
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,740
It could just be anything.

524
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,370
It's been a long time.

525
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,090
They don't hold up that well.

526
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,580
Could you have your lab,you know,analyze it?

527
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,990
Tell me if it's one of ours or--

528
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,310
we're not set up for that kind of investigation,Mr. Scofield.

529
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,620
You could try to send it to a forensic lab,

530
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,190
but I don't know if they'll tell you much either.

531
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:41,200
I've been stewing for 50 years.

532
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,350
Maybe it's time to move on.

533
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,560
To what?

534
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,240
I lost my whole unit over this.

535
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:51,000
I came home.

536
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,510
My wife,she didn't get it.

537
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,970
I've been blazing mad my whole life.

538
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,800
I got nothing left.

539
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,320
It's not too late to let it go and start over.

540
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,680
You're a sweet kid,

541
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:17,680
but you don't know what
it's like to have something change you in your soul.

542
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,700
I do.

543
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,930
I wish I didn't,but I do.

544
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,380
Don't let it turn you.

545
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,700
you look like you had a long day.

546
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,350
You know what fragging is?

547
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,970
We've got an epidemic of it today.

548
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,820
My esteemed attendings are gonna be the death of me.

549
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,210
Is there a front-runner?

550
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,370
I don't know.

551
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:49,960
What I do know is I don't want my attendings tearing each other's throats out

552
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,250
because of some internal power struggle.

553
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,350
It's too dangerous for the hospital.

554
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,550
Does that mean...

555
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,890
is colin marlowe gonna be the new chief?

556
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,790
Good night,Dr. Bailey.

557
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,240
This is ready.

558
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,860
Don't slosh it around.
It's all about the presentation.

559
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,500
Come in and eat with us.

560
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,350
You need to bond with your people,meredith.

561
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,950
People are what matters.

562
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,250
- I hate people.
- Yeah,well,do your own talking.

563
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,110
We talked.

564
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:25,200
We talked hospital,we talked his research,we talked dead mother.

565
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,780
- I'm out.
- Ask about the baby.

566
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,570
Ask if it poos.
People can go on about that for hours.

567
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,800
- oh,the chicken looks delicious.
- Yeah.

568
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,690
It's from the store.

569
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,920
Well,the green beans look great as well.

570
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,150
I...
didn't do those either.

571
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,950
It's beautifully presented.

572
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,720
Izzie did that.

573
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,410
Alex!

574
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,880
Come,sit.

575
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,410
oh.
no,go ahead.

576
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,980
Eat.
We're eating.

577
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,970
This is susan,and this is my father.

578
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,370
Hi.

579
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,400
- Here,you can have this plate.
- Cool.

580
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,490
Okay.

581
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,350
So how are you?
How was your day?

582
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,060
Okay.
Hungry.

583
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,420
Good.

584
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,120
How's the baby?

585
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,610
- Great.
- She's smiling now...sometimes.

586
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,920
she looks exactly like
molly wh-when she smiles.

587
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:29,380
I mean, it's amazing.I've got this
old picture of molly and me

588
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,830
when molly was...
I don't know, 5,

589
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,580
and she's sitting on this red sled
in the snow, this great, big fir tree...

590
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,620
- you know, I'm not sure that that--
- yeah.

591
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,470
No, honey, it's a massive douglas fir.

592
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,490
And in the picture, couldn't
look more like the baby.

593
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,060
- I mean, incredible.
- That's me.

594
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:53,310
The red sled and the big fir tree in the

595
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:59,140
park at the middle school in the ugly,
yellow, plaid wool coat.

596
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,960
That isn't molly.

597
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,740
It's you and me.

598
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,150
- Oh, great.
- crap.

599
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,040
Sorry.
I think I blew a fuse.

600
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,950
- I'll get it.
- No, you know, I could get it.

601
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,310
- It's--
- oh, in the laundry room.

602
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,530
- I keep forgetting.
- What?

603
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,150
It's his house.

604
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,580
I'm going home.

605
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,520
Are you going home?

606
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,280
How did it end?

607
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,040
It ended.
School was ending, I was leaving.

608
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,820
You were done.

609
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,890
I came here.
I fell in love with you.

610
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:56,690
A new mentor with a host of
new things to teach you.

611
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,870
If you think that I'm
in this for the education--

612
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,830
do you or do you not find
my knowledge and my skill compelling?

613
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,930
Oh, god.You know what?
You are blowing this way out of--

614
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,690
a man three times your age

615
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,090
believed that he was having
a substantial relationship with you...

616
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,400
well, yeah, he was.

617
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,590
And one day, you're done, just like that?

618
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,190
yes.

619
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,710
You don't open yourself up...
to anyone.

620
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:21,690
Sometimes...
I think it's charming--

621
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,360
she's different, she's not like other women.

622
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:27,540
But the simple fact is--
is that you have never let me in.

623
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:30,290
What, you think that it's
gonna make a good marriage?

624
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,030
Well, I don'T.

625
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:35,430
I don't want you to marry me
because you're placating me.

626
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,680
That doesn't interest me.

627
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,160
It doesn't interest me at all.

628
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,740
- Do you think he's okay?
- He'll find it.

629
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,870
He probably can't see.
Um, there's a flashlight in the closet.

630
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,060
- I'll go get it.
- Thanks.

631
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,390
Excuse me.

632
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,430
- I'm sorry.
- It's going fine.

633
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,680
I just...

634
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,260
I don't know what to say to him.

635
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,700
Well, it's not easy.

636
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,840
That's 'cause he's afraid of you.

637
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,480
I shouldn't have bit his head off.

638
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,870
I wish I could've just...

639
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:16,880
meredith, it's okay to get angry.

640
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:20,100
It's you in the picture.

641
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,310
Izzie stevens?

642
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,980
I share something with you that
I clearly feel uncomfortable about,

643
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,260
and you tell izzie stevens?

644
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,000
No, I didn't tell izzie.
I told meredith.Meredith told--

645
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,900
oh!
Oh, so that's better?

646
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,340
No, it was an accident.
I--

647
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,180
it was an accident.

648
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,460
I was pissed off--

649
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,710
why can't you give me
the benefit of the doubt that--

650
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,530
that maybe sometimes I'm on your side?

651
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,360
Because you choose your friends
over me

652
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,100
- every chance you get.
- No, I don'T.

653
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,380
I married you, and I haven't talked
to my best friend in weeks.

654
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,090
Meanwhile you lied to me
about where we live and why.

655
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,340
You lied to me about your background.

656
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,030
You lied to me about your family!

657
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,350
And still I'm the dog who gets whacked
on the nose with a newspaper all the time.

658
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,410
When is this gonna stop?

659
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,450
- Oh, so this is my problem?
- Yeah, maybe it is.

660
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:01,220
Oh, oh, so the fact that your
best friend violently disses our marriage

661
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:05,090
every chance she gets,
publicly, repeatedly...

662
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,310
why do you think she does that george?
Have you ever thought about that?

663
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,730
She's having a problem with this.
I understand that.

664
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,220
She has feelings for you.

665
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:16,380
- What?
- She wants you.

666
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,390
She wants you.
That's what this is about.

667
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,350
That's why she hates me.

668
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,810
george, george, do not laugh at me.
Do not laugh at me.

669
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,490
No.
no, I'm not.I'm not.

670
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,690
Oh, god.

671
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,420
I'm not.
I--

672
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:36,320
it's just, come on, she's izzie.
She's--

673
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,820
she's bl--
she's blonde, she's stacked, she's--

674
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:42,020
she's a supermodel.
I'm george.

675
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:47,380
- So what does that make me?
- No.

676
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,350
No, come on.
You are gorgeous...

677
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:51,430
and you're curvy, and I never
thought you'd go for me.

678
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,850
- Just shut up.
- Callie--

679
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:58,550
this is my hotel room that
I pay for with my huge piles of money.

680
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,930
Get the hell out of it!

681
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,900
I'm sorry about the lights.

682
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:15,350
eh, whatever.
The food was good.

683
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,570
- You want some pie?
- Nah, I gotta go.

684
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:20,280
Oh, big plans.
Got a hot date?

685
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,220
Oh.

686
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,550
Well, good for you.

687
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:31,300
I guess "not interested"
really meant not interested.

688
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,100
Iz...

689
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,450
- you didn't want me.
- Yeah.

690
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:40,950
But that doesn't mean I want
you to want anyone else.

691
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:46,870
Am I gonna be alone,
pining over a dead guy forever?

692
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,630
I hope not.
It's kind of a waste.

693
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,710
am I supposed to move on now?

694
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,330
Do people look at me and go,

695
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,730
"she's gotta get over it already.
It's ruining her life"?

696
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,580
You'll move on when you're ready to.

697
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,680
Why are you sitting in the dark?

698
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,660
- Izzie blew a fuse.
- Okay, I'm having a crisis.

699
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,960
Oh, I don't need rescuing.

700
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:21,520
Susan is very nice,
and we're getting through it.

701
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,120
Limping through, but we'll make it.

702
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,650
Okay, no, this isn't a fake crisis.

703
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:29,940
This is a real, "my ex is about to
ruin my impending marriage" crisis.

704
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,140
Oh.

705
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,190
Hey.Hey.
Where's izzie?

706
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,680
Kitchen.

707
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,480
Sorry.
It's not always like this.

708
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,340
Yeah, it--
it kinda is.

709
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,070
They're in the other room.

710
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,500
I need you to get over yourself.

711
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,000
I need you to start liking my wife.

712
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,890
I need you to like her
because sometimes I don't,

713
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,520
and I need you to talk me back into it.

714
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,920
You say you're my friend?
That's the job.

715
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:52,150
Okay.

716
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,000
I need to vent, 
and I need it to be okay.

717
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,400
Okay.

718
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,320
And I need to vent with alcohol.

719
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,590
I got married, 
and I'm scared it was a bad idea.

720
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,850
nobody ever got married and
didn't think that at least once.

721
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,380
did you find the fuse box?

722
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,780
Yeah.
Yeah, I just needed to...

723
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,820
- take a break?
- I don't know how to--

724
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:33,080
or what to talk to her about.

725
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,130
Work's a good place to start.

726
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:37,000
You know, she's proud of what she does.

727
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,780
She's good at it, too.

728
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,660
I'd start with that.

729
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:43,200
You get each other.
That's nice.

730
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,620
Some days it's nice.

731
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:51,970
Some days I'd like to come home to someone
who doesn't know a thing about it.

732
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,160
Rough day?

733
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,630
I almost lost a friend in my own O.R.

734
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,900
Was it your fault?

735
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,910
I don't know.

736
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,900
you were both nervous tonight.

737
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,740
- It'll get easier.
- She was nervous?

738
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,550
Yeah.

739
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,430
She's tough.

740
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:20,300
She tries to hide it.
She's difficult.

741
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,270
But if you make an effort, she's worth it.

742
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,550
You okay?

743
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,750
Not entirely.

744
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,080
She's worth the effort.

745
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,930
All right.

746
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:45,040
Ah, nice.

747
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:48,850
damn it.

748
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,040
- Gotta go back in, huh?
- Yeah.

749
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:02,160
why is there an 11-inch
incision in my chest?

750
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:05,150
you coded on the table--
air embolus.

751
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,250
I had to open you up and aspirate.

752
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,170
See, I'm sure you did a great job,

753
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:14,870
but that's why you're gonna have some
real trouble convincing me to do it again.

754
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,790
Helen...
we got it all.

755
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:22,430
The tumor--we never have to
go back in there again.

756
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:25,520
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

757
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:29,800
You're gonna live a long, long life.

758
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:32,560
And here I thought 
you were just being an ass.

759
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:35,110
Ah, I was an ass.

760
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:43,340
I had no right to push you like that.

761
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,910
No, you did not.

762
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:49,100
I was going through some stuff, and I just--

763
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,710
I...
I was an ass.

764
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,120
Okay.

765
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:58,210
But in this moment, you're the ass
who gave me my life back.

766
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,450
I'm so glad we did this.

767
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,100
I am, too.Thank you for suggesting it.
Because I--

768
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,800
you never would have in a million years.

769
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,700
- good night, sweetie.
- Thank you.Good night.

770
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:15,580
I'm--
I'm sorry a-about your mother.

771
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,050
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

772
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,250
Swing's still here.

773
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:26,380
yes, it, uh, doesn't swing.
Nobody uses it.

774
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:39,220
I put this in there.
You used to catch your fingers in it.

775
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:04,610
suck it up, go back with your tail
between your legs and just apologize.

776
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,190
- No!
- No, really.Look, you just--

777
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:09,550
- I'm always apologizing.
- "I'm sorry.I'm an ass." blah.

778
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,680
And it's over.
And then it's all over.

779
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,650
No.Not real--
I can't be wrong all the time.

780
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,040
is that really possible?

781
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:17,930
Don't--
don't finish it.

782
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:20,970
- Hey, don't be grabby.
- You--I don't have any.

783
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,610
Bogie.

784
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:26,350
Maybe you're wrong all the time,
maybe she's just really insecure.

785
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,130
It doesn't matter.
You still have to grovel.

786
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,720
Don't you--
fill...

787
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,010
yeah, um, she'S...

788
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,420
- she's insecure.
- Yeah.

789
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,310
That is a fact.

790
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,970
She's insecure.

791
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,070
What?

792
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,910
What?
just tell me.

793
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,620
- Come on.
- No.

794
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,560
Come on!

795
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:52,050
shut up.

796
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,570
no, it's, um, ju--nothing.

797
00:38:55,590 --> 00:39:00,830
Just that she thinks you have feelings
for me, like that's the problem.

798
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:03,120
I love that.
That's fabulous.

799
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,540
- No, and--and--and...
- oh, I need a tissue.

800
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,900
That, uh, I-I-I desperately want you.

801
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,800
I'm crying.
I'm crying.

802
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,780
Is she crazy?

803
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,850
You know, I think--
I think she's maybe a little crazy.

804
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,700
- oh, can't breathe.
- Shut up.

805
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,320
I can't breathe.

806
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:30,200
We gotta be quiet.

807
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,590
Ow.

808
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,770
- scary day, huh?
- Yeah.

809
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:49,660
Well, your amniotic sac's intact,
the placenta's in good position.

810
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:53,360
Dr. Montgomery sewed your cervix up
so tight, nothing's coming outta there.

811
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,260
So the baby's gonna be okay?

812
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,840
We're gonna have to see how it goes.

813
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,350
I'm sorry.

814
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:07,180
You asked me what I thought,
and I told you to go for it, and I'M...

815
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,760
- I'm really sorry.
- It's not your fault.

816
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,830
No, see, when I pulled you out of
that water at the ferry, I...

817
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,570
you're...

818
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,430
I talked to you like you were
my sister, and I shouldn't have.

819
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,500
I'm an intern.

820
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:23,040
You gotta get your medical
advice from an attending.

821
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:26,580
I asked you 'cause I trust you.

822
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,790
Why don't you sit and tell me
a bedtime story or something?

823
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,480
What's worse,  new wounds,
which are  so horribly painful...

824
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,850
move over.
You're in the middle of the bed.

825
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:44,560
Or old wounds that should've
healed years ago  and never did?

826
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:57,420
am I gonna screw up this engagement?

827
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:01,230
I don't know.
Do you want to?

828
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,620
I don't know.

829
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:10,820
My mom is dead.

830
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,110
Yeah, she is.

831
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,460
Maybe our old wounds  teach us something.

832
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:26,410
They remind us  of where we've been
and what we've overcome.

833
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:33,520
They teach us lessons about
what to avoid in the future.
