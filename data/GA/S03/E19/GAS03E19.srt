1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,820
previously on "grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,450
- I was dead.
- Now I'm not.

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,020
Anybody come looking for me yet?

4
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,800
No hits from missing persons,plus--

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,990
my face is hard to identify.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,790
Anyone know who the new chief candidate is?

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,320
colin marlowe.the one and only.

8
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,510
- He...
- yes.

9
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,790
- With...
- yes....

10
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,830
That your best friend violently disses
our marriage every chance she gets...

11
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,190
she has feelings for you!

12
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,030
is she crazy?

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,580
surgeons always have a plan...

14
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,950
where to cut,where to
clamp,where to stitch.

15
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,680
But even with the best plans...

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,880
complications can arise,

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,910
things can go wrong...

18
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,660
and suddenly you're caught
with your pants down.

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,260
You and george were really
going at it last night.

20
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,470
- what?
- Oh,the laughing,

21
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,560
the drinking,the music--
okay,you know what?

22
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,420
Nobody,meaning me,

23
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,770
needs to hear george's rendition of
"sexy back" at 3:00 in the morning.

24
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,680
You shoulda-- you shoulda just,
you know,said something or--or...

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,670
banged on the wall.

26
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,480
It's like living in a youth hostel.

27
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,540
Well,the important thing is,
is that she and george made up.

28
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,680
you did,right?

29
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,400
I need to use your bathroom.

30
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,720
- Why?
- Because o'malley is puking in mine.

31
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,840
Okay,youth hostel.

32
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:27,630
George is still here?

33
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,920
Yes.

34
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,890
Yes,but only because he
was too drunk to drive home.

35
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,700
you know,just totally impaired,
like no-heavy-machinery drunk.

36
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,140
What's her problem?

37
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,950
Still drunk.

38
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,970
What's she doing here?

39
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,090
She's afraid she's ruining
her engagement to burke,

40
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,250
so she's hiding from him.

41
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,100
Not anymore.I have a plan.

42
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,390
Burke doesn't want me to
marry him just to appease him--

43
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,930
- which you are-
- so...

44
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,630
we don't get married.

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,560
Simple.

46
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,170
We go back to the way it was.

47
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,840
"Be kind.Rewind."

48
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,040
My plan has a name.

49
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,190
I gotta go.

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,100
Gotta get to work.

51
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,650
I'll see you guys there.

52
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,460
is that george?

53
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,220
You said he was upstairs puking.

54
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,940
So now he's downstairs puking.

55
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,850
- izzie.
- George.

56
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,600
What the hell happened last night?

57
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,470
Callie is gonna kill me.

58
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,850
Did I at least call
her before I passed out?

59
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,600
No.

60
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,640
you don'T...

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,670
you don't remember?

62
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,580
I remember the bourbon...

63
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,090
and,uh...

64
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,300
I don'T...

65
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,770
where did you sleep?

66
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,960
big day.

67
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,810
What time's your interview with the board?

68
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,990
3:00.

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,670

74
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,090
A 10-year plan,which,uh,
really is just a few...

75
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,010
tweaks.

76
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,900
What did,uh,einstein say?

77
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,370
Newton did the work,I'm merely
standing on his shoulders.

78
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,420
And in this scenario,I'm newton.

79
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,870
george...

80
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,200
- You look nice.
- I look insane.

81
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,950
I'm-- I'm wearing pearls.

82
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,230
Listen-- listen,about,uh,last night--

83
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,850
we're gonna have to put
a pin in that for now,

84
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,100
because as of this moment,

85
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,820
you and I are the
perfect couple.Okay?

86
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,790
We are the perfect,happily
married couple who are perfect and--

87
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,860
and never fight,because,uh,

88
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,100
because my dad's in town.

89
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,000
What?

90
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,610
My dad's in town,and,uh,

91
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,690
he wants to meet my husband.

92
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,090
The o'malleys.

93
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,210
carry on.

94
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,530
Do your stuff,your married stuff.

95
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,350
you told her about our fight?

96
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,890
just when exactly is he coming?

97
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,510
Today.Lunch.Cafeteria.

98
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,690
But you know what? I think
I'm gonna change it to joe's

99
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,700
so he might not be able to tell
that stink's coming from you.

100
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,030
No,it's--it's okay.Oh,god.
It's gonna be okay.

101
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,450
Uh,I'm good with parents.

102
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,800
Parents love me.

103
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,420
Funny,funny,funny little man.

104
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,180
Funny little smelly little man.

105
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:25,740
Get in the shower,okay?

106
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,380
- It's gonna be okay.
- Just get in the shower.

107
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,720
I know.You'll see.
He's gonna love me.

108
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,270
No.

109
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,020
what's this?

110
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,600
We bring each other
coffee.This is what we do.

111
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,340
No,it's what we used to do,

112
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,640
before you moved in.We
started making coffee at home.

113
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,940
You know,I'm-- I'm not really interested
in going back to the way it used to be.

114
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,180
So unless you have
something else to say to me...

115
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,250
I've already had my coffee.

116
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,190
Good morning,doctors.

117
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,300
Good morning.

118
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,790
Big day today,huh?

119
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,810
Good luck to all and sundry,hey?

120
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,840
- He has a 10-year plan.
- What?

121
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,860
He's presenting the board with a
10-year plan for the surgical wing.

122
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,080
He's only been here a day.

123
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,280
Did you see that folder?

124
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,280
It's full of plans,

125
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,440
"tweaks" for my hospital.

126
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,340
This is our computer-generated
approximation of your original

127
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,090
facial structure based on
the 3-d C.T.Scans we did.

128
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,730
It's what you could look like
after reconstructive surgery.

129
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,780
or you could look like this.

130
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,520
or this.

131
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,050
You don't like them?

132
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,170
No,it's not that.

133
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,230
um...how does this work exactly?

134
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,600
He'll make an incision along
your hairline,and then...

135
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,920
it's okay.I can take it.

136
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,300
He'll literally pull your face off.

137
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,960
it sounds a lot worse than it is.

138
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,950
Your face is extremely elastic,

139
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,420
and pulling it down allows me
to repair the bone fractures

140
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,660
underneath without causing any scaring.

141
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,060
And once you've healed,no one
will ever know you had the surgery.

142
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,010
I'm that good.

143
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,360
He is.It's annoying.

144
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,040
The surgery won't affect my baby?

145
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,090
I'll be monitoring
the baby throughout.

146
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,750
Okay?

147
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,760
Okay.

148
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,630
So...

149
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,870
then I-I just have to pick one?

150
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,280
do I have to pick one now?

151
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,730
Um,take a couple hours
and think about it.

152
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,460
Couple hours...

153
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,270
dr.Bailey.

154
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,720
Chief,our jane doe is
getting a new face today.

155
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,250
Well,that's exciting.

156
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,630
How are you doing,meredith?

157
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,120
You didn't take too much time off after

158
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,500
I'm fine.Really,sir.

159
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,820
I,uh,I think working is the
best thing I can do.

160
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,590
Like mother,like daughter,huh?

161
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,770
Dr.Grey,what can you tell me about
reconstructing the orbital floor?

162
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,230
Uh,you can create a new base for the eye
socket by harvesting bone from the skull.

163
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,190
Dr.Bailey,dr.Grey will be scrubbing
in on the jane doe surgery.Come on.

164
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,500
I'll show you how to do it without breaking
the bone graft into a million pieces.

165
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,040
congratulations,dr.Grey.

166
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,240
okay,let's go,people.

167
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,520
Oh,wait,wait,wait.

168
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,380
I need to talk to you.

169
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,180
Why?

170
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,240
Uh,to prepare you guys
for what you're about to see.

171
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,060
You meant--you meant "you"
like "us," not like "me."

172
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,120
You don't--you don't
want to talk to me,

173
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,650
you want to talk to us
about a pat--about a patient.

174
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,050
That's what I just said.

175
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:05,530
Uh,this patient has a disease so rare that
you'll probably never see it gain--F.O.P.

176
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,090
Oh,uh,fibrodysplasia
ossificans progressiva?

177
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,900
Yeah.It's a congenital disease
which turns muscle into bone.

178
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,300
You become a human statue.

179
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,590
So just,uh,try to learn.

180
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,700
Try not to stare,okay?

181
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,280
Okay.

182
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,030
If you people are interns,
you need to stand back.

183
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,800
Nina,please don't be rude.

184
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,190
My mother still has movement
in her face and hands.

185
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,420
I would like to keep it that
way,so please be careful.

186
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,660
If you press too hard during an
exam or bump into her accidentally,

187
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,090
it causes a bone to grow
where a bone shouldn't grow.

188
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,120
So there can be no accidents.

189
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,040
Okay,remember that when
you're dealing with her today.

190
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,180
It's just a stomach virus or a flu.

191
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,910
I'm sure it's nothing.
Nina insisted that I come in.

192
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,470
She was vomiting blood

193
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,820
and going through her pain
meds like they were candy.

194
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,060
And she has new growths on her back,

195
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,030
no doubt caused by some clumsy
interns on her last hospital stay.

196
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,090
Well,obviously you're having
a flare-up of the F.O.P.,

197
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,610
But what really concerns
me is the vomiting.

198
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,280
So I'm gonna need a C.T.,
See what's going on.

199
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,820
did you build that?

200
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,670
My mom did.

201
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,010
No,nina did it.

202
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,040
I used to do it.I'm not able to.

203
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,300
It keeps her active.

204
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,250
When she's active,
she has fewer flare-ups.

205
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,530
Plus it makes her happy...

206
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,490
and relaxed.

207
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,700
Good.Okay.

208
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,610
Can I work in the clinic today?

209
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,870
You don't want the F.O.P.Case?

210
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,240
Clinic?Why?What's
going on in the clinic?

211
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,030
Nothing.I just feel clinic-Y.

212
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,200
That's not a word.
I'll take the clinic.

213
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,120
Cristina!

214
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,770
You both can go to the clinic.

215
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,490
The board is interviewing the
chief candidates all day today,

216
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,030
so we're light on surgeries.

217
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,890
O'malley.

218
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,420
Yes?

219
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,140
You're with dr.O'malley.

220
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,310
Okay.

221
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,860
What am I supposed to do?

222
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,550
Find dr.Montgomery.See if you
can help with jane doe.

223
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,820
I showered twice.

224
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,560
It's coming out of your pores,george.

225
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,580
You reek,you're trembling,and there's no way
I'm letting you near my patient right now.

226
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,900
- Dr.Bailey.
- don't tell bailey.don't tell bailey.

227
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,900
Bailey,uh,with
mrs.Rogerson's limited mobility,

228
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,450
I'm gonna,uh,need an extra set of hands.

229
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,920
Fine.

230
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,160
Stevens.

231
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,060
Yang will handle the clinic.

232
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,020
You'll be with the o'malleys today.

236
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,770
it's my foot.

237
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,150
It hurts like crazy.

238
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,450
I'm gonna need a painkiller.

239
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,730
Can't spend the whole day
propped on an ice pack.

240
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,600
Uh,you're gonna need
to take off your shoe.

241
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,310
No,no,no,no.

242
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,590
I've been down this route before.

243
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,690
Just slip me a couple
painkillers,and I'll be on my way.

244
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,900
Sir,uh,did you go to medical school?

245
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,420
I did.

246
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,860
Take off your shoe.

247
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,030
you have type 2 diabetes.

248
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,490
Ten years now.

249
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,880
Yeah,well,you inspect your feet
every day.Have you noticed anything?

250
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:54,890
I notice it hurts.

251
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,340
Look,I got 30 guys sitting on their
ass waiting for me to show up.

252
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,430
Sir,I get it.You're in a hurry.
That makes the two of us.

253
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,090
Sock.

254
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,770
you need to call your guys and
tell them you're not coming in.

255
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,820
did you choose a face?

256
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,340
Not yet.

257
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,560
I was hoping I'd see one of 'em and,

258
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,600
I don't know,recognize myself or something,

259
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,200
but I don't recognize any of these women.

260
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,270
What if I choose the wrong one?

261
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,160
What if my husband or
boyfriend or whoever's baby

262
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,950
this is shows up tomorrow with a--

263
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,190
with a picture of what I'm
supposed to look like,

264
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,120
but it's too late,and I'm stuck with
the wrong face for the rest of my life?

265
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,200
Okay,that would suck,
but if you don't pick one...

266
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,010
this is gonna be your face
the rest of your life.

267
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,710
Shouldn't you be preparing
for your board interview?

268
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,850
I am.

269
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,860
Mmm.You're hovering.

270
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,340
No,I'm breathing you in.

271
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,180
You're hovering.

272
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,780
Fine.I'm hovering.

273
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,130
If cristina would sleep in her own
bed,I wouldn't have to hover at work.

274
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,790
I could hover in bed.

275
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,450
A different type of hovering perhaps.

276
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,490
how bad is it today,

277
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,320
on a scale of one to ten?

278
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,350
Seven.Maybe a six.

279
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,600
You know what's gonna make
it even better than that?

280
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,710
Mnh-mnh.What?

281
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,200
The calvarial bone harvest I get
to do on sloan's jane doe later.

282
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,650
Sloan's gonna let you do a harvest...

283
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,180
by yourself?

284
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,470
By myself.

285
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,790
Which makes me very cool in the
eyes of my dead mother,by the way.

286
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,020
Okay,then.Well,I better let you study.

287
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,640
Better stop distracting me.

288
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:55,800
I will not be cool in the eyes of
my dead mother if I maim jane doe.

289
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,060
uh,we're gonna need you to
lie very still,mrs.Rogerson.

290
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,430
I think I can do that,dr.O'malley.

291
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,760
Sorry about that,mrs.Rogerson.

292
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,190
Oh.I'm never gonna drink again.

293
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,060
I can't believe I have to be
presentable for callie's dad at lunch.

294
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,850
oh,god.

295
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,110
hours-- hours of our lives--

296
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,330
many hours that are all
I can think about,

297
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,060
and you seriously don't remember?

298
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,150
How can you not remember
those many,many hours?

299
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,240
Let--izzie,if...oh,god.

300
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,210
Whatever I did,whatever
I said,I was drunk.

301
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,390
I'm sure I didn't mean it.

302
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,890
George,I promise you,you meant it.

303
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,580
You meant it a lot.

304
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,340
You meant it more than once.

305
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,570
Do you see that?

306
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,370
gotta page callie.

307
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,230
You'll be pleased to hear I'm proposing an
expansion to the hospital board this afternoon.

308
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,050
Give you quite a few more places to hide.

309
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,050
I'm not going to hide.

310
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,590
I'm just trying to find my resident.

311
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,080
I come here to seattle to see you,
and you don't even give me a moment?

312
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,620
You didn't come here to see me.
You came here to get a job.

313
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,640
I came here for both.

314
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,060
Well,you made a mistake.

315
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,390
Are you going to invite me?

316
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,520
- Where?
- To the wedding.

317
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,590
Will you stop talking about the wedding?

318
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,650
Most blushing brides to be
love to talk about the wedding.

319
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,720
What the matter?

320
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,420
Are we getting cold feet.

321
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,790
Please leave.

322
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,670
If he's rushing you,you should tell him.

323
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,310
When you marry,you want to be ready.

324
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,610
He should understand that.

325
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:57,500
Good afternoon,board.No.

326
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:01,140
Good afternoon,ladies and
gentlemen of the board.

327
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,900
I am so grateful for this opportunity.

328
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,340
Don't wear the glasses.

329
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,390
You fiddle with 'em.It makes
you look indecisive.

330
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,060
And stop stressing.

331
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,770
It'll be like any other job interview.

332
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,980
"What do you consider your strengths?
What do you consider your weaknesses?"

333
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,330
What do you consider your weaknesses?

334
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,340
I don't have any.

335
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,220
I'm that good.

336
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,550
What are yours?

337
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,760
I'm an easy mark for evil redheads.

338
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,760
trust me,you have other weaknesses.

339
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,250
Obviously...

340
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,410
you are a man-whore.

341
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,430
Correction.

342
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,960
I was a man-whore.

343
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,290
Yeah,well,while you're bragging
about that to the board,

344
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,220
colin marlowe is pitching
his 10-year plan.

345
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,560
10-year plan?

346
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,700
Was that a requirement?

347
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,430
It is now.

348
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,370
Mrs.Rogerson,according to your C.T.,

349
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,570
You have severe internal bleeding.

350
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,220
It was probably caused by your
anti-inflammatory medication.

351
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,560
Does that require surgery?
Because she can't have any--

352
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:00,930
obviously any surgical procedure could cause
more bone growth or do more damage than good.

353
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,560
That's why dr.Burke's here.

354
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,850
What we can do is insert a
line into your groin and then

355
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,110
float a catheter up and embolize the area.

356
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,690
That's minimally invasive?

357
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,730
As minimally invasive as possible.

358
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,180
But with your condition,
even this is risky.

359
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,370
I'm 41 years old.

360
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,930
Most F.O.P.Patients don't live to 45.

361
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,200
I'm down to the use of my face and hands.

362
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,790
Pretty soon I won't have anything.

363
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,300
So what would happen...

364
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,520
if I refuse the surgery?

365
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,710
You will bleed to death...

366
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,100
within a day or two.

367
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,510
Is that painful?

368
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,760
- Mom,stop,okay?
- Nina,please.Let me think.

369
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,440
The reason you've gotten this far--

370
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,870
our treatment plan works.

371
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,630
It will work.

372
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,230
burke is using powerpoint.

373
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,470
He's doing a powerpoint
presentation for the board,

374
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,820
which is cool if it's,like,1998.

375
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,420
There's no swag,is there?

376
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,240
We're not allowed to give gifts?

377
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:12,950
Why did you ask meredith to do a
bone graft on your jane doe?

378
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,860
Because I'm her teacher,
and that's my job.

379
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,530
You're doing it to impress the chief.

380
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,660
You're setting her up,and
she can't fail right now.

381
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,310
Why don't you let your girlfriend
decide what she can or can't do?

382
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,460
I will hurt you if
this goes wrong for her.

383
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,000
Huh.Is...is that A...

384
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,080
dollhouse?

385
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,490
The lights work and everything.
It's the perfect little home.

386
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,770
Did you have a dollhouse growing up?

387
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,210
I had sex last night...

388
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,180
with the wrong person.

389
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,420
But the thing is,it didn't
feel wrong at the time.

390
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,000
It felt like...

391
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,070
something was falling into place.

392
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,770
so what do I do?

393
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,010
what am I,the go-to person for adultery?

394
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,670
No.I...I just...

395
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,070
I just don't know what to do.

396
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,050
You stop.

397
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,490
That's what you do.

398
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,270
Are you sure?

399
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,170
I mean,how do you know that it
didn't feel so right because...

400
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,360
it's god's plan?

401
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,960
God wants you to be an adulterer?

402
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,420
god got a virgin pregnant by magic.

403
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,190
God is not playing by the rules.

404
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,570
Uh,talk to paul.

405
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,110
Mr.Kendry.

406
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,050
No,paul will get you drywall numbers.

407
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:38,630
Mr.Kendry.

408
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,830
Okay.

409
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,240
Let me just write a couple
notes about that call.

410
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,420
Mr.Kendry,we're gonna have
to amputate your foot.

411
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,170
- What?
- The infection is in the bone.

412
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,630
If we don't remove the foot,
it will travel to your blood,

413
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,100
and that will cause
sepsis and possible death.

414
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,330
I'm sorry.

415
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,880
Y-- how can you be so...

416
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,370
I mean,I-I can't get around A...

417
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,730
no,no,no,no,no.No,no.

418
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,960
You're not cutting off my foot.

419
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,650
Sir,diabetes is a manageable disease.

420
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,700
If you had been here even a
month ago,maybe we could've--

421
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,610
okay,so I screwed up.

422
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,580
But you're telling me that this is my only
option because I'm late getting in here?

423
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,820
That there is no way--

424
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,940
- mr.Kendry-
- no!

425
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,450
Please.

426
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,170
There's gotta be a way
for me to get that month back.

427
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,570
Tell me what to do.

428
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,340
I'll do it.I'll do every line
of every plan you give me.

429
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,680
I'll do it.

430
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,480
Please.

431
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,000
You gotta find a way to save my foot.

432
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,270
Hey,what do you think of a robotics
lab as a goal for the hospital,hmm?

433
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,080
- Derek...
- you're harvesting.

434
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,250
I'm trying to be supportive...But
this graft,it's really tricky.

435
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,430
You don't have to do it,you know?

436
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,980
I talked to mark,and,uh--

437
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,380
you what?

438
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,680
I talked to mark.I mean,
meredith,this is a--

439
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,170
it's a complex procedure--

440
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,070
you don't think I can do it?

441
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,010
When has mark sloan allowed
his interns to do anything,

442
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,720
let alone harvest a bone graft?

443
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,280
He's in the race for chief.

444
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,640
He's trying to prove he can teach.

445
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,740
By teaching you.

446
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,060
Your mother died,and the chief is
gonna be watching you very closely.

447
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,030
And mark is trying to gain points by--

448
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,050
using me.

449
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,640
If it goes well,he gets the credit.

450
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,620
If it goes poorly,he gets the save.

451
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,210
So this is about you one-upping mark.

452
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,400
He's using you.

453
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,790
I'm just trying to protect you.

454
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,450
You don't need to.

455
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,900
Close the door on your way out.

456
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,040
Can I help you with those,dr.Bailey?

457
00:20:59,050 --> 00:20:59,920
What do you want?

458
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,120
See,that's what I like about you.

459
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,570
You always get right to the point.

460
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,230
Make it quick.I'm headed over to the clinic.

461
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,390
All right.

462
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,820
What would you change about
this hospital if you could?

463
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,420
Is this for your board interview?

464
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,510
You want me to do your homework for you
because I'm not busy enough,is that it?

465
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,930
All the other attendings are
putting together 10-year plans.

466
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,880
I was just looking for some input.

467
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,220
Input?You want--

468
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:24,730
I have patients in need of
medical attention right now.

469
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,710
This guy here is about to
have one less appendage.

470
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,360
I don't have a 10-year plan for him.

471
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,240
I have a "right now" plan for him--

472
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,040
cut off his foot to save his life.

473
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:37,020
So you need to get out of my way
right now so I can do my job.

474
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,390
- Right now?
- Right now.

475
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,620
Talk to me about blackouts.Are they real?

476
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,640
Do you really not remember anything afterwards?

477
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,280
Iz, I'm fine.Not drinking.

478
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,200
I'm not drowning my sorrows.Fine.

479
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,550
Everybody needs to stop trying to protect me.

480
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:59,410
Um, this isn'T...really about you.

481
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,330
I'm asking, back when you had a best friend named tequila,

482
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,040
did you actually ever blackout?

483
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,970
Once.No, twice.

484
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:12,020
But the stuff you don't remember is usually the stuff you don't wanna remember.

485
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:16,580
Right.Great.Thanks.

486
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,620
Hey, I have type 2 diabetes.

487
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,820
Patient let it go, and the infection is in the bone.

488
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:23,030
I have to find a fix or cut off the foot.

489
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,810
Anyone?Anybody?

490
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,830
You get to cut off his foot?Cool.

491
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,800
You think--no, not cool.

492
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,200
The patient was neglectful.He made a couple of bad calls.

493
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,780
I mean, does that mean he has no hope?

494
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,770
Does that mean he can't have a do over?

495
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,220
But you get to cut through bone and stuff.

496
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,540
We're talking about burke now.

497
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,650
We are?

498
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,490
Mm-hmm.Operation "be kind.Rewind." Not going so well?

499
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,400
you need to fix it.

500
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,140
'Cause it seems like you guys have a pretty good thing,

501
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,570
and pretty good things are rare and hard to come by,

502
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:55,220
unlike really screwed up, complicated things, which...

503
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,590
seem to be freakin' everywhere.

504
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,440
You know what?Things are great.

505
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,830
I'm gonna get things back to the way we were.

506
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,200
Watch me.

507
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,610
has jane doe picked a face?

508
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,180
no, not yet.

509
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,650
How cool would that be, to get to pick your own face,

510
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:18,340
just...disappear and start all over?

511
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:22,480
How you doing?

512
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,220
How am I doing?I'm freaking out, alex.That's how I'm doing.

513
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,090
I can't do this.I can't pick.I can't.

514
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,870
All right.Okay.

515
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:37,670
Uh, well, let's, uh...let's meet the contenders, all right?

516
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,170
Uh, let's see.

517
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,110
This...this is...maggie.

518
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,040
Married her high school sweetheart, has two kids-- boy and girl.

519
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,720
Loves being a mom, coaches her daughter's basketball team

520
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,790
and makes an insane banana cream pie.

521
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,420
Banana cream pie?

522
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,870
It's my favorite, so shut up.

523
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,380
And this is...um...elizabeth.

524
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,080
Graduated from northwestern.

525
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:09,160
Met her husband at a political rally where they got arrested and fell in love.

526
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:13,690
She's all angry and fired up, but everyone forgives her because she means well.

527
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:21,510
Ahh...wow.This one...this one's ava.

528
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:27,040
She's funny, she's tough, you know, little neurotic sometimes,

529
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,960
but you get used to it.

530
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:31,190
You can tell she's--she's been through a lot in her life,

531
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:35,530
but it's only made her stronger, you know?

532
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,810
it's just, your daughter, the way she...

533
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,030
you know, she's sort of undeniable.

534
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:54,870
And, uh, after I lost my father,
I realized, you know, that life is short.

535
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,740
And it's--it's long, too...

536
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,760
short and long.

537
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,780
Life...he talks a lot.

538
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,060
No, no.He--he--he talks.

539
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,180
Like a--like a-- like a person who talks, dad.Please.

540
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,220
Do you have any idea what you've done to your mother?

541
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:18,230
You make this decision, the most important day of your life...

542
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:21,400
we didn't even know she was seeing someone.Are you pregnant?

543
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,610
did you get my daughter pregnant?

544
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,050
No.No.Daddy, no, it is not-- hmm?

545
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,230
No.This is george, okay?

546
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,030
He's not like the other guys I've been with.

547
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,600
Clean as a whistle, and a mathlete.

548
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,790
He has no money.You have money.

549
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,810
- Oh, come...
- I didn't know that callie was well-off.

550
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,710
She just told me.

551
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,820
Really?Really?Well, then you won't mind if the house,

552
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:45,370
the car and everything else we'll provide
will be in calliope's name.

553
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,520
- Uh, what house?
- You're a married woman now.

554
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:51,100
I'll find something suitable.It's all here
in the postnuptial I've drawn up.

555
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,550
- The--oh, dad!
- Sorry.

556
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,470
I've got it.It's all right.It's okay.

557
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,250
You know what?You--

558
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,740
somewhere you can raise a family.

559
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,130
No.What?

560
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,590
No, that's not gonna happen.

561
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,450
There's no way I'm gonna let you pay for anything.

562
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:21,640
I can't--we can't, uh...callie, I'm so sorry.

563
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:25,000
Mr.Torres, I'm sorry, but the answer is no.

564
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,690
you remembered.

565
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,120
Wow.That's really coming along.

566
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,840
- It looks great.
- Thanks.

567
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,720
We've been working on it for months.

568
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,090
But when I say "we," I mean "she.

569
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,820
" I just hold things and look pretty.

570
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,980
that can be hard work, too.

571
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,520
I'm gonna need to draw some blood for, uh, your surgery.

572
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,000
mm-hmm.Be careful.

573
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:58,750
You can only use one specific vein in this area here.

574
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,130
- Okay.
- Oh!I said be careful.

575
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,160
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

576
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,700
No, it's not.If she's gonna be that clumsy,
she's not drawing your blood.

577
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,100
Nina, she's just doing her job.

578
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,090
Not very well.I'm going to get a nurse, a senior nurse.

579
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,900
Oh, nina, stop.

580
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,510
No, mom.Do not let her touch you.

581
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,440
We can't be too careful.

582
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,860
You're not taking her blood.

583
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,400
She's not even a person anymore.

584
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,040
You know what I mean?

585
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,210
Mrs.Rogerson-- I know I'm gonna die.

586
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,270
You know, maybe not today, but soon.

587
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,570
I just need to talk, you know?

588
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,220
Nina won't let me talk.

589
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,230
I just need to talk.

590
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,130
No coffee.

591
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,890
One more thing for marlowe to tweak.

592
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:56,900
please tell me you're not coming up with a 10-year plan for this hospital.

593
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,750
You can come up with all the plans you want,
but in the end, it just...

594
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,300
doesn't make one bit of difference.

595
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,340
- Things happen.People just-
- drown?

596
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,780
yeah, you know, when i pulled her out of the water, it was...

597
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:19,190
she was like ice.She can swim.

598
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:25,270
Richard, she'S...she gave up.

599
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,080
I close my eyes for a moment, it's like she's back in the water.

600
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,930
I'm up, and I just listen to her breathe, you know?

601
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,160
Just...in case she stops.

602
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,990
So I can come up with plans for the hospital, but...

603
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:44,860
but if they ask me where I'm gonna be in ten years...

604
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,110
george.

605
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,230
Mr.Torres.

606
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:01,960
You want to take care of her in your own way.Hmm?

607
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:05,460
I understand that.I respect it.

608
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:09,820
But you have to understand, she's my only little girl, george.

609
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,840
And you need to promise me that you will love her and protect her,

610
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,600
because the minute that you hurt her...

611
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,420
you understand?

612
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,290
good.then I'll tell callie's mother she can plan the party.

613
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,590
What pa--what?

614
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,950
Your wedding party.

615
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,120
- Oh, dad, come on.Oh, no
- please, mija.

616
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,080
For my sanity, mija, just let her plan a party.

617
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,690
All right, all right.Okay.

618
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:36,050
All right.I have a plane to catch.

619
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,560
Come here.george.

620
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,980
Bye, dad.

621
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,450
you stood up to him.Nobody does that.

622
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,230
I was all proud.

623
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:57,230
So listen...

624
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,640
about last night, I don't know about you, but personally,

625
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,520
I'd like to take back about 90% of it.

626
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,300
Me, too.

627
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,370
Good.Good.Okay.

628
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,350
Then go-- go find izzie and help her prep mrs.Rogerson.

629
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,330
I'll see you in surgery.

630
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,020
You here to keep my baby alive?

631
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,190
I am.

632
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,960
Good.

633
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,240
So?

634
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:29,360
So...call me ava.

635
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:34,770
You been practicing?You know the chief will be watching today.

636
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:37,580
The chief.Right.Of course.

637
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,020
"Of course" what?

638
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,900
Derek was right about you.

639
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,610
You're using the memory of my dead mother to win points with the chief.

640
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,010
It's despicable, and I'm not gonna play.

641
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,680
The chief-- the way he was looking at you this morning--

642
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:56,600
was like you were some beaten down puppy
he picked up off the side of the road.

643
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:03,830
You do this procedure and you do it well,
he'll start looking at you like a surgeon again.

644
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:06,110
But, you know...

645
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,070
you wanna think of me as despicable, you wanna pass up this shot,

646
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:11,910
that's up to you.

647
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:27,660
They're doing a-amazing things with prosthetics these days.

648
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,550
This doesn't mean your life is over.

649
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,150
Uh, take him up to the O.R.I'll meet you there.

650
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,560
You've got your board thing now?

651
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,030
The chief picked you...originally.

652
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,760
You were always supposed to be the next chief.That was the plan.

653
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,270
That was a long time ago.

654
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,950
A lot has happened since then.

655
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,360
But you're still that guy.

656
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,990
You're the guy the chief chose.

657
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,430
No, I'm not.

658
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:11,050
I'm not that guy, cristina, and I wouldn't want to be.

659
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,320
I want to be better than that.

660
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,790
I'd like to believe that I've grown.

661
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,050
I want to move forward.

662
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:21,010
I'm not interested in going back.

663
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,930
Dr.Burke.

664
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,620
You ready?

665
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,970
Osteotome and hammer.

666
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,430
All right, use the curved osteotome to elevate the external table.

667
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:47,760
Gently.

668
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,470
- how's it looking?
- still see bleeding.

669
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:01,270
The platinum microcoils-- they aren't holding.

670
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,710
What about using a gelatin sponge?

671
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,770
I've already tried polyvinyl alcohol, glue,
microcoils-- nothing's working.

672
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:09,060
B.P.'S dropping to 62 systolic.

673
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,290
we're gonna have to open her up.

674
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,780
If you open her up, she's dead.

675
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,700
If we don't, she's dead.

676
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,610
beginning amputation.

677
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,490
fine amputation, yang.

678
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,870
wait.Now they're laughing.

679
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,060
Laughing?

680
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,120
They're laughing.

681
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,770
Well, they can't be laughing with him.

682
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:40,130
They have to be laughing at him.

683
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:43,670
I'm surprised you don't have a shot glass pressed up against that window.

684
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,510
We weren't listening.

685
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,340
let me show you the new clinic.

686
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,200
Hey, chief.

687
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,760
So?

688
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:59,070
If you ask me, you all could stand to
borrow a page from dr.Sloan's book.

689
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,470
Sloan?

690
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,740
you're kidding right?That's a joke?

691
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:05,860
He didn't get caught up in this whole 10-year plan foolishness.

692
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,680
He said he had a "right now" plan for seattle grace.

693
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,890
A right now plan?

694
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,560
A right now plan?

695
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,160
Is that right?

696
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,790
The board ate it up.

697
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,660
To tell you the truth, so did I.

698
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,400
I should've brought her in sooner...

699
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:33,560
the first time she threw up.

700
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,720
I knew better.

701
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,840
- Nina, there was nothing any of us could-
- no.

702
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,920
It was a mistake.

703
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:49,860
Your mother...talked to me.

704
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:53,310
She wasn't ready to leave you,
but she was ready to leave her body.

705
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:59,910
Please.I don't need you to explain the relative
comforts of death for my mother.

706
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:06,300
What she was afraid of was that you had taken on so much of her disease

707
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,750
that you were freezing up, too.

708
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:14,450
You've spent so much time planning and...helping her avoid risk--

709
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:18,490
god knows, that's what you should've been doing-- but...

710
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:21,170
she was worried.

711
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,280
You have a healthy body, nina.

712
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:27,220
If you fall down, you won't turn to stone.

713
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:33,280
And your mom so wanted you to just let yourself fall.

714
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:39,720
Messing up...it's what makes a person.

715
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:45,580
It's how we learn...where we find joy--

716
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:52,670
in the things you don't plan for, the things you never see coming.

717
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:04,090
Okay.It happened.

718
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,410
It was a mistake, and it happened.

719
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:09,330
People make mistakes.

720
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,570
We need to figure out where we go from here.

721
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,440
We need to figure out how to tell callie.

722
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,130
I'm not gonna tell callie.

723
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,360
Do you know how much this would hurt her?

724
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,860
I'm not gonna clear my conscience at her expense.

725
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,290
She has done nothing but support me,
encourage me and believe in me,

726
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,610
and this is how I pay her back?

727
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,530
No, I have to live with what I did.

728
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:35,950
This is our secret, okay?

729
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,990
Okay.

730
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,460
The thing about plans is, they don't take into account the unexpected.

731
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:51,240
So when we're thrown a curveball whether it's in the O.R.

732
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,640
Or in life...

733
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:54,790
how are you feeling?

734
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,700
We have to improvise.

735
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,100
I'm a guy without a foot.

736
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,040
What do I do now?

737
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:09,710
You move forward, you...you follow the plan,
and you try and keep your other foot.

738
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:13,230
My other foot.

739
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,390
Right.

740
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:24,750
Of course, some of us are better at it than others.

741
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,920
I'm impressed, karev.

742
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:35,500
You spent the whole day watching a fetal monitor and never complained.

743
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,530
Well, I, uh, I do what I'm told.

744
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:39,350
Since when?

745
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,750
Depends on who's doing the telling.

746
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,500
good night, dr.Karev.

747
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,230
What was that?

748
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,440
Hey, how'S...ava?

749
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,980
Mm.I don't think I'm gonna know the answer to that for a little while.

750
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:04,720
What do you say we talk about you and the redhead instead?

751
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:07,570
Well, the redhead's my boss, so...

752
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,910
- so?
- so it's complicated.

753
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,590
And?And...

754
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:20,000
some of us just have to move on to plan B...

755
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,870
and make the best of it.

756
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:42,910
Mm-hmm.it has to be small-- just you and me...and meredith...

757
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:47,220
and--and shepherd, too, if you want.But that's it.

758
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,200
And a justice of the peace.

759
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,160
I know you're...spiritual and stuff,

760
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:59,460
but I-I don't want any rabbis or ministers, nothing religious.

761
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:06,340
We'll just...make an appointment at city hall, and that'll be that.

762
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:08,230
And no veil.Okay?

763
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:12,890
I don't want to get married with mosquito net all over my face.

764
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:28,660
I let mark use the memory of my mother to win points with the chief.

765
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,240
You were right.

766
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,010
I'm sorry.

767
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:33,180
You know what's weird?

768
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,520
What's weird?

769
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:37,970
It's exactly what she would have wanted.

770
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,690
Dead mommy's proud?

771
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:42,610
Dead mommy's proud.

772
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,820
How was your interview?

773
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:53,250
Okay.It wasn't great.

774
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:55,790
I was distracted.

775
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:58,520
by what?

776
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,720
Nothing.

777
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,760
I don't know.

778
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:09,970
On a scale of one to ten, how bad is it?

779
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,200
Eight.

780
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,950
How about now?

781
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:19,260
Seven.

782
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,480
And sometimes...

783
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:26,980
- how about now?
- Six.

784
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,350
What we want...five.

785
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:32,680
Is exactly what we need.

786
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,200
but sometimes...

787
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:05,570
I can smell your clothes through the closet door.

788
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:07,790
Did you tie them up in a plastic laundry bag?

789
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:09,870
Yeah.

790
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:19,770
I'm sorry.I'm--I'm so sorry.

791
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,710
Well, I guess I can...live with it.

792
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:30,710
Mm.Sometimes what we need is a new plan.

793
