1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,436
Previously on
"Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,466 --> 00:00:03,231
When I told you I was
done trying to compete?

3
00:00:03,261 --> 00:00:04,813
That was me breaking
up with you.

4
00:00:04,843 --> 00:00:07,080
I broke up with Finn.
- Yeah.

5
00:00:07,138 --> 00:00:08,874
The patient died last month

6
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:12,019
from complications following a heart transplant.
- Denny.

7
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,570
Are there any questions for me?

8
00:00:13,634 --> 00:00:16,316
I got shot. I'm not fine.
You're not fine.

9
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:18,631
You quit being a surgeon.

10
00:00:18,716 --> 00:00:20,730
You'll stand on my right side,
I'll look at you,

11
00:00:20,762 --> 00:00:23,498
and you'll know to slide in to
do the sutures we've practiced.

12
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:24,624
Nobody has to know.

13
00:00:26,086 --> 00:00:27,083
<i>To make it...</i>

14
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:29,043
<i>really make it...</i>

15
00:00:30,016 --> 00:00:31,112
<i>as a surgeon...</i>

16
00:00:32,307 --> 00:00:34,043
<i>it takes
major commitment.</i>

17
00:00:41,896 --> 00:00:44,492
<i>We have to be willing to
pick up that scalpel</i>

18
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:49,653
<i>and make a cut that may or may
not do more damage than good.</i>

19
00:00:50,197 --> 00:00:52,193
<i>It's all about
being committed...</i>

20
00:00:53,107 --> 00:00:54,601
<i>because if we're not...</i>

21
00:00:55,545 --> 00:00:59,172
<i>we have no business picking up
that scalpel in the first place.</i>

22
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:05,630
Put Burke in O.R. 2 tomorrow at
10:00 A.M., the usual scrub team.

23
00:01:05,637 --> 00:01:07,662
And get rid of his
valve replacement at 2.

24
00:01:07,696 --> 00:01:08,832
That's no-- that's no good.
- Yang,

25
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:09,860
Brought you a latte.

26
00:01:12,158 --> 00:01:13,393
You're not scrubbing in.

27
00:01:13,558 --> 00:01:15,251
But Burke always
lets me scrub in.

28
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:18,183
Hey, Yang, uh, can i get in on Burke's-
- No, no, okay?

29
00:01:18,185 --> 00:01:19,060
No residents.

30
00:01:19,068 --> 00:01:21,162
Burke says you crowd him,
so just go away.

31
00:01:21,896 --> 00:01:24,462
Make sure you put the instrument
tray on his left-hand side.

32
00:01:24,498 --> 00:01:26,931
He needs the extra elbow room.
And remember, O.R. Two.

33
00:01:26,965 --> 00:01:28,482
No gallery. Burke was specific.

34
00:01:28,516 --> 00:01:32,012
Dr. Burke's become very specific
since coming back to work, hasn't he?

35
00:01:32,335 --> 00:01:34,382
Do you want me to tell
him you said that?

36
00:01:36,246 --> 00:01:38,512
Burke's back, and suddenly
Cristina's running his board?

37
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:40,243
Who does she think
she is--Bailey?

38
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,710
She's helping him.

39
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:43,100
Bull. She's taking advantage.

40
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:45,920
She gets out of rounds, she scrubs
in on every surgery Burke does,

41
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:47,353
she's ordering around
third-year residents.

42
00:01:47,387 --> 00:01:48,922
You guys are overreacting.

43
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:50,592
I'm so sorry.
It's completely illegible.

44
00:01:50,628 --> 00:01:52,870
I mean,
why don't you just write it properly?

45
00:01:54,268 --> 00:01:55,981
She is writing on
the O.R. Board.

46
00:01:56,626 --> 00:01:58,222
Maybe I should
sleep with Burke.

47
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:00,873
You've been busy.

48
00:02:02,305 --> 00:02:03,190
Yeah.

49
00:02:04,405 --> 00:02:05,831
Derek hasn't called yet.

50
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,050
I told him I broke up
with Finn a week ago.

51
00:02:08,088 --> 00:02:09,232
He still hasn't called.

52
00:02:09,768 --> 00:02:12,232
Hey, do you want to go grab a drink, catch up?
- Uh, no, I can't.

53
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,763
I have to study up for
Burke's surgeries tomorrow.

54
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:19,011
She's busy.

55
00:02:24,427 --> 00:02:25,301
Callie.

56
00:02:28,295 --> 00:02:31,320
Hey, talk to me.

57
00:02:32,257 --> 00:02:34,342
Hey, how about talking to
me instead of ignoring me?

58
00:02:34,376 --> 00:02:35,940
Callie.
- George!

59
00:02:37,147 --> 00:02:38,393
Well, that's talking.

60
00:02:38,395 --> 00:02:39,550
That's a good start.

61
00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:44,863
Oh!

62
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:45,803
Oh, god.

63
00:02:46,226 --> 00:02:47,082
Hey, stranger.

64
00:02:47,088 --> 00:02:48,182
Oh, Nancy.

65
00:02:48,728 --> 00:02:49,771
You don't call first?

66
00:02:51,486 --> 00:02:53,790
Hi. You know, I...

67
00:02:55,186 --> 00:02:55,910
Meredith.

68
00:02:59,577 --> 00:03:00,750
Oh, Meredith.

69
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:03,302
Wait. Let me explain. Meredith.

70
00:03:05,027 --> 00:03:08,403
Oops. I take it that was the slutty
intern you cheated on Addison with?

71
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:10,413
She's not slutty.
What are you doing here?

72
00:03:10,445 --> 00:03:12,372
You bailed on Thanksgiving
and Christmas,

73
00:03:12,407 --> 00:03:14,691
and you live in a trailer,
and you're getting a divorce.

74
00:03:14,725 --> 00:03:17,211
And then there's the slutty intern.
- I really don't like you.

75
00:03:17,245 --> 00:03:18,252
You love me.

76
00:03:25,948 --> 00:03:27,662
Feeling good. Really good.

77
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:28,692
Good.
- Good.

78
00:03:29,427 --> 00:03:33,570
Yeah, first day back.
It's big. Kinda nervous.

79
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,212
But feeling good.
Do I look okay?

80
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:35,971
- Great.- Great.

81
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,571
I want to get off
on the right foot.

82
00:03:37,605 --> 00:03:39,441
Gotta  get my I.D.
renewed, new time card,

83
00:03:39,475 --> 00:03:41,823
sign some papers with legal,
and then I'm back.

84
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:43,240
I'm really back.

85
00:03:43,437 --> 00:03:44,513
- Yeah.- Yeah.

86
00:03:45,657 --> 00:03:47,722
This is me--human resources.

87
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,561
See you guys on the floor.

88
00:03:48,597 --> 00:03:49,461
Yeah.

89
00:04:00,138 --> 00:04:03,802
Okay, I'll be Cristina for
you if you'll be Izzie for me.

90
00:04:04,597 --> 00:04:05,393
Deal.

91
00:04:08,946 --> 00:04:10,820
Derek had a woman in
his trailer last night.

92
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:13,033
She was ugly, very ugly.

93
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:14,690
Except she was tall
and beautiful.

94
00:04:14,725 --> 00:04:16,360
And he was naked.

95
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:19,023
Oh, uh...

96
00:04:20,015 --> 00:04:23,392
McDreamy was doing the
McNasty with a McHottie?

97
00:04:23,545 --> 00:04:25,161
That McBastard.

98
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,781
How--how was that?

99
00:04:27,788 --> 00:04:29,180
That was good.
- Cristina enough? Really?

100
00:04:29,216 --> 00:04:30,033
Yeah.
- Yeah?

101
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:31,141
- Yeah.

102
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,882
Yeah, 'cause-- -
Channeling Izzie. Go.

103
00:04:32,915 --> 00:04:34,283
Okay, uh, Callie...

104
00:04:34,428 --> 00:04:36,391
She won't forgive me.

105
00:04:36,498 --> 00:04:39,373
Um... She won't talk to me.
She dumped me.

106
00:04:40,318 --> 00:04:42,051
Which is, uh...

107
00:04:42,055 --> 00:04:44,833
I don't care about,
you know, at all.

108
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,033
Good, because you
deserve better.

109
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:49,452
You do.

110
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:51,463
You are George.

111
00:04:52,076 --> 00:04:53,402
I mean, seriously.

112
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:55,361
Seriously.

113
00:04:55,865 --> 00:04:57,051
Seriously.

114
00:04:57,678 --> 00:05:00,242
Was that Izzie-optimistic?
- That's very Izzie.

115
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,520
What the hell has
happened to us?

116
00:05:04,586 --> 00:05:07,950
We are now the people that the
people we want to be with avoid.

117
00:05:08,515 --> 00:05:10,061
We have careers to think about.

118
00:05:10,348 --> 00:05:12,241
We don't need attention 
from men with perfect hair.

119
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:13,270
You know,

120
00:05:13,826 --> 00:05:15,013
we should make a pact.

121
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:17,060
There's no more dating.

122
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:18,331
No more Derek. No more Callie.

123
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:19,843
Just 100% focus on our work.

124
00:05:19,857 --> 00:05:22,503
They're dead to us.
- They are freakin' corpses to us.

125
00:05:23,077 --> 00:05:24,283
Preston Burke.

126
00:05:24,338 --> 00:05:26,711
What a pleasure.
I have read so much about you.

127
00:05:26,715 --> 00:05:27,651
Well, thank you.

128
00:05:27,888 --> 00:05:30,281
Pruitt  Byrd.
Medivac brought him in this morning.

129
00:05:30,316 --> 00:05:32,452
He presents with a
primary cardiac tumor.

130
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:37,330
We've been told Pruitt needs a
"cardiac autotransplantation".

131
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,492
A cardiac autotransplantation?

132
00:05:39,498 --> 00:05:41,882
A humpty dumpty surgery.
- Yes, I know what it is.

133
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:44,442
Mrs. Byrd,
this is a very complicated surgery.

134
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:46,632
You'll need thorough testing.
- Oh, already done.

135
00:05:46,665 --> 00:05:48,583
Mr. Byrd is a
perfect candidate.

136
00:05:48,588 --> 00:05:50,780
You understand what this
surgery entails? We have to--

137
00:05:50,815 --> 00:05:52,861
we have to remove his heart,
cut it open,

138
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,763
scrape out all the tumor and then
put his heart back together again.

139
00:05:55,795 --> 00:05:56,853
Which is risky.

140
00:05:58,205 --> 00:06:00,253
But possible.
- Which is why we're here.

141
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:02,792
I want the very
best for my Pruitt.

142
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,582
The best.
- She means you.

143
00:06:05,688 --> 00:06:07,380
I know that, however--
- I've scheduled Mr. Byrd

144
00:06:07,412 --> 00:06:08,868
for surgery this afternoon.

145
00:06:11,221 --> 00:06:13,244
Just trying to be as
efficient as possible.

146
00:06:13,276 --> 00:06:14,893
Legal cleared Stevens.

147
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:17,800
Explain her parameters and
make sure she understands.

148
00:06:17,967 --> 00:06:19,683
What, Stevens is being
assigned to me again?

149
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:20,420
She's your intern.

150
00:06:20,456 --> 00:06:21,931
But I-I didn't think that--

151
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:24,332
wouldn't be better for her to

152
00:06:24,335 --> 00:06:26,622
start fresh with
another resident?

153
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:30,221
You don't want her, huh?
- I... want her to succeed.

154
00:06:35,468 --> 00:06:38,651
There's still a good deal of
fallout after the Duquette M&M.

155
00:06:38,655 --> 00:06:39,623
There's been talk.

156
00:06:39,637 --> 00:06:42,643
Look, I don't need to tell you that
there are doctors in this hospital

157
00:06:42,676 --> 00:06:44,570
who have concerns
about your judgment.

158
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:47,581
Concerns about my judgment?
- Stevens was your mistake.

159
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:53,011
Do you, sir?
Do you have concerns about my judgment?

160
00:06:54,217 --> 00:06:55,401
Do you?

161
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:01,952
You're not gonna put
those concerns to rest

162
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:04,453
by avoiding taking
responsibility for Dr. Stevens.

163
00:07:05,376 --> 00:07:07,480
She's your intern... again.

164
00:07:08,697 --> 00:07:10,353
Transfer from Mercy West.

165
00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:13,611
Noelle Labatt, 32 weeks along,
pregnant with twins.

166
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:15,853
One appears to be developing
more slowly than the other.

167
00:07:15,887 --> 00:07:17,432
Hi.
- Hi, there.

168
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,452
Greg Stanton. This is my fiancée,
the future Mrs. Stanton--uh, Noelle.

169
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:24,513
Greg, I promise you, you're the only
person who cares if we're married
or not.

170
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,111
They said at mercy that
we had to come here

171
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:27,842
because her condition
could be serious.

172
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,112
I-is it serious?
- I've got to say, at first glance,

173
00:07:30,145 --> 00:07:33,240
you don't seem emergent enough for Mercy
to send you over here in an ambulance.

174
00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:36,460
You're not in labor, you're not
bleeding, your vitals are fine.

175
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:38,403
They said I need a specialist
because of my thing.

176
00:07:38,436 --> 00:07:40,203
Your thing?
- Two uteruses?!

177
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:47,460
Ms. Labatt, uh, Noelle was born
with two uteruses. Uh, uteri?

178
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:48,820
Uteruses.
- Uteruses.

179
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,411
That's very rare.

180
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:55,491
I'm here. Hi. Hello.

181
00:07:56,005 --> 00:07:58,081
That paperwork took--
Well, forever.

182
00:07:58,085 --> 00:08:00,851
But I'm all do with it now,
and can I just say how...

183
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:03,651
really grateful
I am to be back?

184
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,292
You understand there are
rules to your probation,

185
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:08,790
a protocol to follow?

186
00:08:08,986 --> 00:08:12,681
Yeah,  I know. Legal already took
me through lots of that stuff--

187
00:08:12,695 --> 00:08:15,693
the mandatory counseling,
the extra lab hours,

188
00:08:15,698 --> 00:08:17,721
the volunteer work with
transplant patients.

189
00:08:17,757 --> 00:08:19,381
That's the stuff you're
doing for the chief.

190
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:21,562
I'm talking about what
you're doing for me.

191
00:08:22,337 --> 00:08:24,600
Okay, uh...
what am I doing for you?

192
00:08:24,616 --> 00:08:26,742
Okay, let's start with
what you don't get to do.

193
00:08:26,775 --> 00:08:29,172
You will not interact
with any patients.

194
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,101
You will not be alone
with any patients.

195
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:32,882
You will be seen and not heard.

196
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,513
You will perform no procedures.

197
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:36,132
The O.R. is off limits.

198
00:08:36,136 --> 00:08:37,620
No pre-op, no post-op,

199
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:39,472
no anything have to
do with an "op."

200
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:40,770
You have no authority,

201
00:08:40,777 --> 00:08:43,181
you have no opinions and you
have no choice in this matter.

202
00:08:43,218 --> 00:08:44,571
Am I understood?

203
00:08:46,237 --> 00:08:49,442
Is... there anything I can do?
I want to be useful.

204
00:08:49,448 --> 00:08:52,603
Well... I can't use you.

205
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:57,190
You've got to earn back the right 
for any of us to trust you again.

206
00:08:57,197 --> 00:08:59,972
Until then, you will be shadowing
a different doctor each day.

207
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,121
Okay, well, who am I with today, Dr.
Montgomery, you?

208
00:09:02,157 --> 00:09:03,680
Dr. Bailey, you paged.

209
00:09:03,686 --> 00:09:04,782
Dr. Grey.

210
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,232
Meredith?

211
00:09:06,687 --> 00:09:09,572
You're to make sure that
Stevens observes only.

212
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,553
You want me to...

213
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:14,152
Wait, Meredith...

214
00:09:15,825 --> 00:09:17,453
Meredith  is the boss of me?

215
00:09:22,935 --> 00:09:27,352
Grey's Anatomy - Episode 306
<i>Let the Angels Commit</i>

216
00:09:29,265 --> 00:09:30,991
I'm sorry, about this.

217
00:09:30,996 --> 00:09:31,961
It's not your fault.

218
00:09:31,996 --> 00:09:33,392
Hey, you want me to
fetch you some coffee,

219
00:09:33,517 --> 00:09:34,453
rub your feet maybe?

220
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:36,533
I did not ask for
this assignment.

221
00:09:36,538 --> 00:09:37,860
I'm fine with it.
Really, it's fine.

222
00:09:37,896 --> 00:09:39,940
Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Dr. Stevens--

223
00:09:39,948 --> 00:09:41,431
Hey, Dr. Shepherd.
- Welcome back.

224
00:09:41,466 --> 00:09:42,010
Okay.

225
00:09:42,037 --> 00:09:44,803
Uh, Meredith, Meredith--
- Sorry, it's not like I can leave.

226
00:09:44,836 --> 00:09:46,483
I gotta stay by my boss' side.

227
00:09:46,497 --> 00:09:48,132
Okay, the trailer sucks,

228
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:50,021
but in the light of day,
the land's nice.

229
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:51,392
Seattle's pretty
in the daylight,

230
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,222
plus you have your
thing for ferries, so...

231
00:09:53,257 --> 00:09:54,550
- Ferry boats.
- Ferry boats.

232
00:09:54,587 --> 00:09:55,920
Right. Whatever.

233
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:56,970
Dr. Stevens, uh, Meredith,

234
00:09:57,008 --> 00:09:58,383
this is my sister Nancy.

235
00:09:58,386 --> 00:09:59,660
Oh, hi.

236
00:09:59,677 --> 00:10:00,350
Sister?

237
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:01,431
Yeah.  Mm-hmm.

238
00:10:01,438 --> 00:10:04,391
Oh. You're one of
Derek's sisters.

239
00:10:04,398 --> 00:10:06,432
Yeah, well,
I knew you didn't think I was the wife

240
00:10:06,465 --> 00:10:08,630
seeing as you
already ran her off.

241
00:10:08,846 --> 00:10:10,720
Nancy is visiting
from Connecticut.

242
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:12,833
She's on her way home now,
straight back home.

243
00:10:12,866 --> 00:10:15,172
Well, it was nice to meet you.
- Okay.

244
00:10:16,497 --> 00:10:18,803
McDreamy's sister's McBitchy.

245
00:10:20,346 --> 00:10:21,883
You put me in charge
of your schedule.

246
00:10:21,915 --> 00:10:24,272
To make sure that I didn't
get a surgery like this one.

247
00:10:24,305 --> 00:10:26,373
Only a handful of people
do humpties, Burke,

248
00:10:26,405 --> 00:10:27,661
and you're the best
one on the west coast.

249
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:29,073
Well, he can go to Houston.
- Hey, you want--

250
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:30,520
You want to tell
that to the chief?

251
00:10:30,556 --> 00:10:32,380
Pruitt needs this surgery.
He'll die without it.

252
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,440
You didn't tell me.

253
00:10:33,617 --> 00:10:35,430
You told the patient we
were doing the surgery,

254
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,710
but you didn't tell me.

255
00:10:36,717 --> 00:10:38,313
I have been doing
that all week.

256
00:10:38,315 --> 00:10:40,510
Are you up on the humpty?
Do you realize what this entails?

257
00:10:40,545 --> 00:10:41,961
I have done my research.

258
00:10:42,335 --> 00:10:43,990
Stop worrying.

259
00:10:43,997 --> 00:10:45,762
We are a well-oiled machine.

260
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:53,983
Uh, Dr. Burke.- Yeah.

261
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,472
I understand there are some
doctors in this hospital

262
00:10:56,507 --> 00:10:58,950
who have concerns about
my judgment since Denny.

263
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:01,941
Well, everybody loves a scandal.
- So you think it's just gossip,

264
00:11:01,978 --> 00:11:05,751
not actual concern
about me as a doctor?

265
00:11:06,107 --> 00:11:08,303
Sure. Sure.

266
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:12,110
'Cause...

267
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:17,721
Ow. Iz,
set me up for debridement and dressing.

268
00:11:17,728 --> 00:11:19,183
It was stupid. I know better.

269
00:11:19,185 --> 00:11:21,090
When I'm studying for the bar,
I'm a mess.

270
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:22,740
I can't focus on
anything for weeks

271
00:11:22,776 --> 00:11:25,822
but torts and real property
and constitutional law.

272
00:11:25,827 --> 00:11:27,141
Uh, the biosynthetic ones.

273
00:11:27,147 --> 00:11:27,991
We never use those.

274
00:11:28,026 --> 00:11:31,233
We do now. Sloan changed
the burn protocol last week.

275
00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:33,840
I was about to start a practice test,
and I wanted some tea,

276
00:11:33,877 --> 00:11:36,920
so I put on a pot of water and
hit the timer and just forgot.

277
00:11:37,187 --> 00:11:39,220
Half an hour into my
section on contracts,

278
00:11:39,255 --> 00:11:42,380
the smoke alarm was blaring,
and well, you know the rest.

279
00:11:42,386 --> 00:11:43,293
So you're gonna be a lawyer?

280
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:45,072
All I have to do is
pass the bar exam.

281
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:47,420
I failed before,
but this time I'm ready.

282
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:48,543
I'm gonna pass.

283
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:49,501
Good for you.

284
00:11:52,855 --> 00:11:53,750
That was just mean.

285
00:11:53,788 --> 00:11:56,732
Kathleen called and told me to find
out why the slutty intern's panties

286
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:58,291
were hanging on the
hospital bulletin board.

287
00:11:58,328 --> 00:12:00,232
Four sisters--four sisters
and not one brother,

288
00:12:00,265 --> 00:12:01,611
and you wonder why
I don't call more.

289
00:12:01,645 --> 00:12:03,750
Feel free to explain about
the panties at any time.

290
00:12:03,787 --> 00:12:05,300
Nance, you know what?
It's great to see you.

291
00:12:05,338 --> 00:12:06,193
Really great to have you here.

292
00:12:06,228 --> 00:12:08,371
But I have a job, you know?
I have patients.

293
00:12:08,407 --> 00:12:11,062
I have a mother at 35 weeks with twins.
Where is her O.B.?

294
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,863
Well, her O.B. should be on a plane
back to Connecticut where she belongs.

295
00:12:13,896 --> 00:12:18,070
Okay, so we've covered the trailer. We
still need to cover the slutty intern
and the divorce.

296
00:12:18,108 --> 00:12:21,322
You know what? You sound more
and more like mom every day.

297
00:12:21,868 --> 00:12:22,953
Take it back!

298
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:25,932
So two uteruses...
that's pretty cool.

299
00:12:27,566 --> 00:12:29,443
And you're engaged.
That's also cool.

300
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,642
Well, Greg talked me into it.

301
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:34,602
Oh, man, from the first moment
I saw Noelle, I was ham.

302
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,470
Did you just say "ham"?
- You're either ham or eggs.

303
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,910
Here we go.
- You gotta ask yourself in every situation,

304
00:12:39,946 --> 00:12:42,591
are you the chicken
or are you the pig?

305
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:44,333
Sorry, pig or chicken?

306
00:12:44,335 --> 00:12:45,933
Look, you got a plate of ham and eggs,
all right?

307
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,443
Now--now the chicken is
involved in the meal,

308
00:12:48,578 --> 00:12:50,161
but the pig--
now the pig is committed.

309
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:54,180
So the question is--
are you involved or are you committed?

310
00:12:55,147 --> 00:12:56,491
Ham or eggs.

311
00:12:57,018 --> 00:12:57,960
Ham or eggs.

312
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,120
Karev, you free?

313
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:03,730
Absolutely, sir.

314
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,351
Great, take this.
I'm on hold with the D.M.V.

315
00:13:06,388 --> 00:13:09,283
Some mix-up about switching my
license and registration to Seattle.

316
00:13:09,318 --> 00:13:10,562
Take care of that for me?

317
00:13:11,238 --> 00:13:13,021
Thanks for thinking of me, sir.

318
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:16,122
O'Malley, how's it feel to
be the new gynie grunt?

319
00:13:16,158 --> 00:13:20,642
Oh, I got a patient who was born with
and is pregnant in two uteruses.

320
00:13:21,857 --> 00:13:24,532
Two uteruses. Jealous?

321
00:13:24,896 --> 00:13:28,592
No. No, I'm--I'm--
I'm busy. I'm on hold.

322
00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:30,163
Oh.
- Yeah, important business.

323
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:31,190
Right.
- For Sloan.

324
00:13:31,337 --> 00:13:33,231
Right, it's super important,
I'm sure.

325
00:13:33,837 --> 00:13:35,821
Noelle Labatt, room 2314.

326
00:13:35,897 --> 00:13:38,113
Two, two, two, two, two, two

327
00:13:38,335 --> 00:13:40,432
Hang on.
Can I see that for a sec?

328
00:13:40,508 --> 00:13:42,703
Did I just hear him
say "two uteruses"?

329
00:13:43,638 --> 00:13:46,031
I'm sorry. You-- you must be...

330
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:47,503
Nancy-pants?

331
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:49,203
Hey, loser.

332
00:13:49,377 --> 00:13:51,880
I wish Derek had told me
you were coming to visit.

333
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:53,911
Oh, like he tells you
anything these days?

334
00:13:53,947 --> 00:13:55,563
Yeah, well,
I'm working on that.

335
00:13:55,647 --> 00:13:56,561
What are you doing here, Mark?

336
00:13:56,597 --> 00:13:57,963
Are you trying to torture him?

337
00:13:57,995 --> 00:13:59,542
He's my family, Nancy.

338
00:13:59,545 --> 00:14:01,533
Plus, I needed a
change of pace.

339
00:14:02,638 --> 00:14:04,790
Plus, I slept with my
tennis partner's wife,

340
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:06,233
and he went out
and bought a gun.

341
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:07,400
There it is.

342
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,232
Oh, my God. Nancy!

343
00:14:12,605 --> 00:14:14,001
Let me guess.
Did mom send you out?

344
00:14:14,035 --> 00:14:15,642
I hear Derek's trying to
ban you from Seattle.

345
00:14:15,675 --> 00:14:18,573
Did he also tell you that he's living in a trailer?
- Yeah.

346
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:20,482
Derek.

347
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:24,020
Oh, Derek.

348
00:14:24,357 --> 00:14:25,830
I want to see the two uteruses.

349
00:14:25,868 --> 00:14:27,521
Yeah, um, find me later.

350
00:14:29,377 --> 00:14:30,472
I miss her.

351
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,180
Yeah... me, too.

352
00:14:34,898 --> 00:14:37,140
The diesel pushes past
cornerback Don McNeal.

353
00:14:37,238 --> 00:14:38,092
He's at the 30.

354
00:14:38,165 --> 00:14:39,023
He's at the 20.

355
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:40,103
He's at the 10. 

356
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,621
Touchdown, washington Redskins.

357
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:45,341
I'm sorry.
One of the twins gets rowdy,

358
00:14:45,347 --> 00:14:47,561
and Greg gets carried away
when talking to the baby.

359
00:14:47,598 --> 00:14:50,461
He's decided that the baby is
into sports, of all things.

360
00:14:50,468 --> 00:14:52,060
Well, she's daddy's
little girl.

361
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:54,242
I can tell, see,
because when I talk to her--

362
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:56,042
yeah, the rhythm in your voice,
it helps calm her. Sure.

363
00:14:56,077 --> 00:14:58,010
I  read a couple of articles
on that recently, actually.

364
00:14:58,046 --> 00:15:01,841
Dr. Karev, I knew you secretly missed my service.
- Right.

365
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:04,471
Greg, Noelle,
I have very good news for you.

366
00:15:04,478 --> 00:15:07,571
According to our tests,
the babies are both perfectly healthy.

367
00:15:08,597 --> 00:15:12,431
But they are substantially different
sizes for a very unique reason.

368
00:15:12,507 --> 00:15:15,322
The test indicate that the babies
have two different due dates.

369
00:15:15,356 --> 00:15:17,752
According to our calculations,
the larger baby, your son,

370
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:21,200
was conceived a full six
weeks before your daughter.

371
00:15:23,816 --> 00:15:24,962
I...
- Oh, God.

372
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,241
I-I don't--
I-I don't understand.

373
00:15:27,247 --> 00:15:28,610
That--that can't be right.
That's impossible.

374
00:15:28,647 --> 00:15:30,371
No, actually,
it's quite possible.

375
00:15:30,378 --> 00:15:32,821
Our tests are extremely accurate
in predicting due dates.

376
00:15:32,855 --> 00:15:35,782
But we broke up.
Yeah, see, she, um, she got pregnant.

377
00:15:36,056 --> 00:15:37,520
I wanted to get married.
She didn't.

378
00:15:37,556 --> 00:15:39,942
I gave her an ultimatum,
and she left me.

379
00:15:40,576 --> 00:15:44,152
Greg, I am so sorry.
I am so, so sorry.

380
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,450
I mean, we were barely speaking

381
00:15:46,606 --> 00:15:49,263
six weeks after the conception,
let alone having sex.

382
00:15:50,027 --> 00:15:51,761
Or at least I
wasn't having sex.

383
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:54,293
It was one night, Greg.
It was one night.

384
00:15:54,685 --> 00:15:57,342
I-I didn't think that this could happen.
It was nothing.

385
00:15:57,376 --> 00:15:58,823
I can't believe you did this.

386
00:15:59,307 --> 00:16:00,782
I can't believe
you didn't tell me.

387
00:16:00,818 --> 00:16:03,612
Oh...
- God, I can't believe this.

388
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,732
He's not the father
of both babies.

389
00:16:18,338 --> 00:16:23,163
I just accidentally broke the news of
my patient's infidelity to her fiancé.

390
00:16:23,197 --> 00:16:26,712
And yet no one is questioning
your competence as a surgeon.

391
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:27,950
No. What?

392
00:16:27,995 --> 00:16:31,003
I need a button.
I'm down to my last clean shirt,

393
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:32,282
and I'm missing a button.

394
00:16:35,238 --> 00:16:36,833
Adele always
handled my buttons.

395
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:38,461
Have you called her?
- Adele?

396
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:43,122
Oh, no, no. I wouldn't want to bother
her with something as trivial as
a button.

397
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:47,203
I don't suppose either
of you would want to...

398
00:16:48,577 --> 00:16:49,700
I'm sorry.

399
00:16:50,098 --> 00:16:52,361
I have two uteruses
I have to attend to.

400
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:56,310
I have many skills,
many skills, surgical skills.

401
00:16:56,887 --> 00:17:00,060
Your button ruptures its oesophagus,
I'm your woman.

402
00:17:00,098 --> 00:17:01,553
Otherwise...

403
00:17:09,276 --> 00:17:11,730
I hear you burned your hand
because you were studying?

404
00:17:11,768 --> 00:17:14,740
I can't even be allowed to warm soup
within five days of taking the bar.

405
00:17:14,778 --> 00:17:17,142
So you burned your hand while you were-
- Burning my soup.

406
00:17:17,176 --> 00:17:19,162
And when you grabbed the pot-
- Dropped it, obviously. I mean,

407
00:17:19,198 --> 00:17:20,452
it was literally red hot.

408
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:22,743
You must have held on to it
for a little while, though.

409
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:24,120
This burn's extremely deep.

410
00:17:24,385 --> 00:17:26,840
Oh, yeah. No, that's right.
I held on, and then I dropped it.

411
00:17:26,877 --> 00:17:28,843
There are some deep partial
thickness burns here.

412
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,903
Give her a gram of
cefazolin and a tetanus.

413
00:17:30,938 --> 00:17:34,023
It's too bad, really,
that I did this to my hand.

414
00:17:34,035 --> 00:17:35,843
I'm supposed to be taking
the bar again friday.

415
00:17:35,877 --> 00:17:39,413
This burn is bad,
but we'll get you fixed up.

416
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,592
You'll be fine to take
the test on friday.

417
00:17:42,497 --> 00:17:43,931
I will?

418
00:17:46,536 --> 00:17:48,113
She's lying.

419
00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:50,612
Something's off about Gretchen's story.
- Izzie,

420
00:17:50,648 --> 00:17:52,150
you're only supposed
to be observing.

421
00:17:52,186 --> 00:17:53,091
I am observing.

422
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,653
I'm observing closely.
And I'm telling you something is off.

423
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:58,372
Did you see her reaction when Sloan told
her he'd be okay to take the test again?

424
00:17:58,405 --> 00:17:59,491
That was not relief.

425
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:00,560
That was panic.

426
00:18:00,566 --> 00:18:04,711
It's okay to be nervous about being
back here at work, about failing,

427
00:18:04,838 --> 00:18:06,782
but you haven't even been
back a full day yet,

428
00:18:06,815 --> 00:18:09,243
and already you're pushing to bend the rules.
- Meredith,

429
00:18:09,275 --> 00:18:10,722
Meredith, this is
so not about me.

430
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,302
This is about our patient.
I am worried about our patient,

431
00:18:13,335 --> 00:18:14,532
and get off your
high freakin' horse.

432
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:16,950
This is my patient.
Try to remember that.

433
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:21,442
Fine. Whatever.
- Iz.

434
00:18:28,186 --> 00:18:29,432
A humpty dumpty surgery?

435
00:18:30,585 --> 00:18:32,860
B-burke's doing a
humpty dumpty today?

436
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:34,580
Um, yes.

437
00:18:34,587 --> 00:18:36,733
Well, I've never seen a
humpty firsthand before.

438
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:38,062
Yeah, me neither.

439
00:18:38,837 --> 00:18:40,782
Uh, what are you doing?

440
00:18:40,948 --> 00:18:42,042
Scrubbing in.

441
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:43,941
You'll let Burke know?

442
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:45,753
Sure.

443
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:51,631
I know you're not talking to me anymore,
and that's okay,

444
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,071
but there's something
I'd like to explain.

445
00:18:53,108 --> 00:18:54,553
All you have to do is listen.

446
00:18:58,575 --> 00:18:59,503
You and me,

447
00:18:59,717 --> 00:19:00,962
we're like ham and eggs.

448
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:01,883
I was the chicken.

449
00:19:01,886 --> 00:19:04,143
I just want you to know that
I know that I was the chicken.

450
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:06,220
You put yourself out there
and you were committed,

451
00:19:06,257 --> 00:19:08,243
and I was just putting
the eggs on the plate.

452
00:19:08,278 --> 00:19:09,931
Not the ham,
because you were the pig.

453
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:12,342
I was involved,
but now I'm committed.

454
00:19:12,348 --> 00:19:14,122
Did you just call me a pig?
- No, it's a metaphor.

455
00:19:14,158 --> 00:19:15,022
Calling me a pig?

456
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:16,540
The point is,
you're not the pig anymore.

457
00:19:16,578 --> 00:19:20,430
What I'm trying to say is I'm the pig.
Now I am the pig.

458
00:19:26,278 --> 00:19:27,510
I am the pig.

459
00:19:36,327 --> 00:19:39,132
I've been waiting for you guys for
a half an hour in the cafeteria.

460
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,983
Since when do we eat
in a patient room?

461
00:19:41,016 --> 00:19:42,883
Izzie, meet really old guy.

462
00:19:43,105 --> 00:19:44,833
We found him a
couple of days ago.

463
00:19:44,837 --> 00:19:46,303
He sleeps all the time.

464
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:48,840
It's quiet in here.
Nobody bothers us.

465
00:19:52,205 --> 00:19:53,353
No, what are you doing?

466
00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:55,210
It turns out I'm
not doing anything.

467
00:19:55,248 --> 00:19:57,333
I'm literally not
allowed to do anything.

468
00:19:57,918 --> 00:19:59,712
I knew coming back was gonna be an adjustment,
- No.

469
00:19:59,748 --> 00:20:01,460
- but this is just--
- What are you doing right now?

470
00:20:01,498 --> 00:20:03,442
- Eating my lunch.
- Okay, if you want to socialize

471
00:20:03,477 --> 00:20:05,892
or talk about your day or get
in a quick therapy session,

472
00:20:05,925 --> 00:20:06,963
you know, go do it over there.

473
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:07,842
Seriously?

474
00:20:07,846 --> 00:20:09,672
Good-bye, Izzie.
- Okay, fine.

475
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:11,971
So, O'Malley,
your chick with the two uteruses?

476
00:20:12,005 --> 00:20:14,690
You're on scut--
glorified plastics scut.

477
00:20:14,698 --> 00:20:17,630
You are in no position to
mock me or my uteruses.

478
00:20:17,635 --> 00:20:19,543
Any cervical changes
on the ultrasound?

479
00:20:19,575 --> 00:20:20,871
Why do you care?
- I don't.

480
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:25,513
I'm so glad to be back. Yay!
I'm not complaining about you.

481
00:20:25,518 --> 00:20:26,963
You and I are fine, boss.

482
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:36,313
This is weird.

483
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:37,791
I called callie a pig.

484
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:39,003
To her face?

485
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:42,400
What happened to the whole
she's a corpse thing?

486
00:20:42,435 --> 00:20:45,163
I just can't get over how much
everything around here has changed.

487
00:20:45,197 --> 00:20:46,483
How many times?
- Just one time.

488
00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:47,820
I get one, too, then.
- Deal.

489
00:20:47,855 --> 00:20:48,513
Gin.

490
00:20:52,676 --> 00:20:54,993
What was, uh, with that,
with Meredith?

491
00:20:55,527 --> 00:20:56,592
We have a thing.

492
00:20:57,475 --> 00:20:59,721
Wait, you have a thing with
Meredith and I don't know about it?

493
00:20:59,755 --> 00:21:01,280
I live with you.
I see you every day.

494
00:21:01,315 --> 00:21:02,352
It's a work thing.
- Okay, you know,

495
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:05,483
the whole point of hanging out with
really old guy is that he doesn't talk.

496
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:06,783
The man is sedated.

497
00:21:07,258 --> 00:21:09,310
This is supposed to
be a quiet place.

498
00:21:10,405 --> 00:21:12,101
See? Changed.

499
00:21:12,665 --> 00:21:13,800
She's changed.

500
00:21:14,355 --> 00:21:15,583
Everything's changed.

501
00:21:16,095 --> 00:21:19,213
I gave the other nurse a list of
his medications this morning.

502
00:21:19,216 --> 00:21:22,831
My husband needs his pills.
He needed them hours ago!

503
00:21:22,837 --> 00:21:24,372
Oh, oh, okay.
Why don't you check on the meds again?

504
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:26,852
I have checked on them.
- No, meds, pharmacy, now.

505
00:21:27,466 --> 00:21:30,792
Just... I'm sorry. I am sorry.

506
00:21:30,796 --> 00:21:32,093
It's fine. It's fine.

507
00:21:32,218 --> 00:21:33,970
I was never a yeller before.

508
00:21:34,508 --> 00:21:38,650
I'm becoming this horrible person who
yells at people who are just trying to

509
00:21:39,345 --> 00:21:40,660
do their job.

510
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,961
You are just looking
out for your husband.

511
00:21:44,107 --> 00:21:46,023
You do exactly what it
takes to protect him,

512
00:21:46,058 --> 00:21:47,851
and that does not
make you horrible.

513
00:21:48,065 --> 00:21:49,281
It makes you smart.

514
00:22:16,145 --> 00:22:17,501
He said he was leaving.

515
00:22:17,565 --> 00:22:19,110
He said he wasn't coming back.
- She's hyperventilating,

516
00:22:19,148 --> 00:22:20,943
and the baby's had
some bradycardia.

517
00:22:20,945 --> 00:22:22,860
Noelle, I need you to
get back into bed now.

518
00:22:22,895 --> 00:22:24,493
Is Greg out there?
Did he leave?

519
00:22:24,658 --> 00:22:25,820
Like really leave?

520
00:22:25,827 --> 00:22:26,652
Just take deep breaths.

521
00:22:26,687 --> 00:22:28,871
I always give him such a hard time,
you know, about everything.

522
00:22:28,905 --> 00:22:30,633
Like he likes weddings.
I hate them.

523
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:32,690
He loves kids, and me,
they scare me to death.

524
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:34,900
Noelle, have you had any cramping,
any contractions,

525
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:36,023
any pressure at all?

526
00:22:36,026 --> 00:22:37,553
But I can't do
this without him.

527
00:22:37,587 --> 00:22:40,353
We'll get past this, right?
We have to get past this. Aah!

528
00:22:40,387 --> 00:22:43,431
Damn it. All right, Noelle,
I need you to get into bed, okay?

529
00:22:43,437 --> 00:22:44,803
Why, what's happening? Ow!

530
00:22:44,807 --> 00:22:48,641
Stay on your left side,
and whatever you do, do not push, okay?

531
00:22:49,727 --> 00:22:52,640
Okay, I need slow,
deep breaths.

532
00:22:53,036 --> 00:22:54,680
So tell me about
the slutty girl.

533
00:22:55,318 --> 00:22:57,220
Fine, the slutty intern.

534
00:22:57,236 --> 00:22:58,640
It was the slutty part
I had a problem with.

535
00:22:58,676 --> 00:23:00,081
Kathleen says she's
not even single.

536
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:02,231
She is single.
She's wonderful. She's smart.

537
00:23:02,265 --> 00:23:04,510
She's a lot of things.
And she's none of your business, Nancy.

538
00:23:04,546 --> 00:23:07,551
Wow, I've never seen you
like this over a girl,

539
00:23:07,556 --> 00:23:08,103
even Addison.

540
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,901
I've never been like
this over a girl,

541
00:23:09,937 --> 00:23:11,191
especially Addison.

542
00:23:11,198 --> 00:23:12,251
Oh, don't be bitter.

543
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:13,833
I mean,
shame on Addison and all that,

544
00:23:13,868 --> 00:23:14,980
but he's Mark, Derek.

545
00:23:14,987 --> 00:23:15,981
What did you expect?

546
00:23:16,148 --> 00:23:17,922
He's just... Mark.

547
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:20,902
And who hasn't gone there
once or twice, right?

548
00:23:23,896 --> 00:23:24,570
What'd you say?

549
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:25,951
Oh, come on.
Everybody sleeps with Mark.

550
00:23:25,985 --> 00:23:27,930
It's practically
a rite of passage.

551
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:30,393
Derek, I get it, okay?

552
00:23:30,397 --> 00:23:33,490
I get that they made a terrible mistake.
- It wasn't a mistake.

553
00:23:33,837 --> 00:23:35,040
Nancy, it wasn't a mistake.

554
00:23:35,076 --> 00:23:37,762
It wasn't just one night.
It was months.

555
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:40,412
They were together for months.
Didn't you know that?

556
00:23:41,316 --> 00:23:42,512
No, I had no idea.

557
00:23:42,515 --> 00:23:44,680
Then shut up about it
and eat your lunch.

558
00:23:57,176 --> 00:23:59,800
Derek's sister is in town.

559
00:24:01,188 --> 00:24:03,320
Cristina, are you mad
at me or something?

560
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:07,171
Because I have been trying to talk...
- Everything is not about you, Meredith.

561
00:24:07,348 --> 00:24:09,393
Okay, what is going on?

562
00:24:09,396 --> 00:24:11,413
Because George and Alex are saying--
- I-I don't care.

563
00:24:11,447 --> 00:24:13,041
What is your problem?
- I just...

564
00:24:14,726 --> 00:24:16,953
I have bigger things
in my life right now.

565
00:24:47,916 --> 00:24:48,840
What?

566
00:24:53,565 --> 00:24:54,502
Nothing.

567
00:24:55,576 --> 00:24:56,692
10 blade.

568
00:25:02,595 --> 00:25:04,261
Hey. Hey, Dr.
O'malley. Can you, uh,

569
00:25:04,297 --> 00:25:05,671
can you tell me what's
happening in there?

570
00:25:05,706 --> 00:25:07,790
I thought you left.
She thinks you left her.

571
00:25:07,828 --> 00:25:10,222
This is all a lot to digest.

572
00:25:10,595 --> 00:25:11,462
I mean, our daughter,

573
00:25:11,496 --> 00:25:14,440
my--my little girl isn't
even my little girl anymore.

574
00:25:14,448 --> 00:25:17,283
Noelle is in there freaking
out because you left.

575
00:25:17,287 --> 00:25:20,243
Just tell me if she
is okay, please.

576
00:25:21,868 --> 00:25:24,332
She's gone into premature labor.
Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd--

577
00:25:24,366 --> 00:25:27,823
Dr. Montgomery is about to
do an emergency c-section

578
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:30,041
on one of the babies to try to
stop the labor on the other.

579
00:25:30,076 --> 00:25:33,240
Wait, so you're delivering one
of the babies right now, today?

580
00:25:33,248 --> 00:25:34,410
In just a few minutes.

581
00:25:35,715 --> 00:25:37,051
The boy or the girl?

582
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:38,513
Greg...

583
00:25:39,857 --> 00:25:40,851
Ham or eggs?

584
00:25:54,418 --> 00:25:56,112
You say you want a
career in plastics,

585
00:25:56,148 --> 00:25:58,392
and yet you can't tear yourself
away from the baby catchers

586
00:25:58,426 --> 00:26:00,131
long enough to actually
show me you want it.

587
00:26:00,165 --> 00:26:03,751
Being on hold with the D.M.V. has
nothing to do with a career in plastics,
Dr. Sloan.

588
00:26:03,788 --> 00:26:07,752
Only it does, because being on hold
with the D.M.V. has to do with me,

589
00:26:07,758 --> 00:26:10,600
and I have everything to do
with your career in plastics.

590
00:26:17,428 --> 00:26:21,502
Tyler... Addison Montgomery needs
two units of b-positive blood in l&d.

591
00:26:21,505 --> 00:26:22,802
Stat.- I'm on it.

592
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:33,403
So the biosynthetic dressing should
ensure that you won't need skin grafts,

593
00:26:33,408 --> 00:26:34,593
and that's good news.

594
00:26:34,665 --> 00:26:36,813
If I did need grafts,
would that take long?

595
00:26:37,365 --> 00:26:40,370
I mean, I mean, like how long would
something like that take if--if I had
needed them?

596
00:26:40,405 --> 00:26:43,763
Uh, that would just depend on
the severity of the burn, really.

597
00:26:43,766 --> 00:26:45,793
Oh, so more severe
than this one?

598
00:26:46,418 --> 00:26:48,033
It would have to
be more severe?

599
00:26:51,347 --> 00:26:53,842
Just to make sure I have
everything accurate,

600
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:56,653
uh, you burned your hand...

601
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,853
we've been over this,
haven't we?

602
00:26:59,225 --> 00:27:02,542
Uh, I'm sorry. I--
- Look, I have a test on friday,

603
00:27:02,545 --> 00:27:05,310
and I have work to do.
So I have to-- I-I want to go home.

604
00:27:05,347 --> 00:27:07,283
I'm really ready to get
out of here now, okay?

605
00:27:07,318 --> 00:27:08,542
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--

606
00:27:08,578 --> 00:27:10,292
Gretchen, did you burn
your hand on purpose?

607
00:27:10,327 --> 00:27:12,223
Izzie, you heard what Dr.
Bailey said.

608
00:27:12,908 --> 00:27:14,123
It's okay if you did.

609
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:18,700
It's just, did you burn your hand
to get out of taking your test?

610
00:27:27,698 --> 00:27:29,791
I can't fail that damn
test one more time.

611
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:31,760
I just... can't.

612
00:27:32,058 --> 00:27:34,003
It's all anyone in my family,
in my life--

613
00:27:34,035 --> 00:27:36,481
it's all they talk about.
It's all I'm known for.

614
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:38,520
"Oh, Gretchen, the failure."

615
00:27:40,146 --> 00:27:44,403
Can you imagine failing the bar
exam five times? Five times.

616
00:27:44,657 --> 00:27:47,273
I mean, that's absurd.
I mean...

617
00:27:47,275 --> 00:27:49,481
that's just, uh...

618
00:27:51,498 --> 00:27:52,853
that's pathetic.

619
00:27:54,148 --> 00:27:58,113
I cannot sit for two and a half
solid days of testing again

620
00:27:59,068 --> 00:28:03,543
just to prove to
everyone... again...

621
00:28:06,047 --> 00:28:07,790
how pathetic I am.

622
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,472
Not... when...

623
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:15,152
you feel that pathetic
all by yourself.

624
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:27,641
I've completed the incision.

625
00:28:27,646 --> 00:28:30,283
I'm going to ask you to move
the top uterus to the side

626
00:28:30,315 --> 00:28:32,013
so I can reach the
one underneath.

627
00:28:32,675 --> 00:28:33,531
Got it.

628
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:37,723
Now I don't want to alarm you or make
you nervous in any way, O'Malley,

629
00:28:37,725 --> 00:28:40,401
because you seem like
a decent person, but

630
00:28:40,408 --> 00:28:44,683
I've got about 120 seconds to
get baby one out of uterus one

631
00:28:44,688 --> 00:28:46,550
while you're
holding uterus two,

632
00:28:46,937 --> 00:28:48,641
and if you so much as hiccup,

633
00:28:48,648 --> 00:28:52,001
you could tear the uterine wall
and kill this woman's child.

634
00:28:52,006 --> 00:28:54,980
So do what you can to be careful, okay?
- Okay.

635
00:28:57,488 --> 00:28:59,830
Wow. Look at that.
- Amazing, huh?

636
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:09,213
Applying the final
hemostasis suture.

637
00:29:09,478 --> 00:29:11,921
Great. Don't be afraid to--
- grab a bigger piece?

638
00:29:12,156 --> 00:29:13,011
Got it.

639
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:16,093
Hmm. Good. Very nice, Dr. Yang.

640
00:29:17,585 --> 00:29:20,422
Applying pressure.
- Gently.

641
00:29:31,817 --> 00:29:34,050
It was attached to the
interventricular septum.

642
00:29:34,085 --> 00:29:35,881
Are you gonna use
a graft to repair?

643
00:29:36,755 --> 00:29:39,703
Somebody's been doing their homework.
- 4-0 prolene, please.

644
00:29:40,297 --> 00:29:41,961
Thank you very much, Boki.

645
00:29:45,838 --> 00:29:48,151
Ready to perforate
uterus two. Scalpel.

646
00:29:49,168 --> 00:29:51,410
Wait. Wait, Dr. Montgomery.
My baby's moving.

647
00:29:51,496 --> 00:29:52,870
It's really moving.
I can't hold it.

648
00:29:52,907 --> 00:29:54,840
I need you to hold her still if
I'm gonna do this c-section.

649
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:55,720
I'm trying.

650
00:29:56,696 --> 00:29:58,293
I mean it, O'Malley.
- What should I do?

651
00:29:58,325 --> 00:29:59,680
It's really moving.
I can't hold it.

652
00:29:59,718 --> 00:30:00,823
I need you to keep her still.

653
00:30:00,856 --> 00:30:03,612
You're sending her into distress.
You have to get that baby to stop moving.

654
00:30:03,646 --> 00:30:04,501
How do I do that?

655
00:30:04,506 --> 00:30:05,882
Talk, O'Malley.
- Alex.

656
00:30:06,545 --> 00:30:07,961
Karev, back away
from the table.

657
00:30:07,995 --> 00:30:10,300
Talk to it, to the baby, to calm it down.
- Karev.

658
00:30:10,335 --> 00:30:11,251
Talk about what?

659
00:30:11,787 --> 00:30:13,680
October 30, 1974--

660
00:30:13,698 --> 00:30:15,481
It's the fight known as
"rumble in the jungle".

661
00:30:15,518 --> 00:30:18,870
World heavyweight champ George
Foreman is pitted against Muhammad Ali

662
00:30:18,907 --> 00:30:21,321
his first major fight after three
and a half years out of the ring.

663
00:30:21,357 --> 00:30:23,401
It's working.
- Foreman is favored to win.

664
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,352
He's younger, he's stronger...
- Scalpel.

665
00:30:25,386 --> 00:30:27,900
But he's not prepared for what Ali
would later call the rope-a-dope.

666
00:30:27,935 --> 00:30:29,351
It all started in
the second round.

667
00:30:29,388 --> 00:30:32,581
Foreman comes out swinging.
Ali's backed up against the ropes...

668
00:30:43,077 --> 00:30:45,013
That's not gonna stay on.
You're giving it too much slack.

669
00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:46,380
You're blocking my light.

670
00:30:47,755 --> 00:30:49,733
Think of it as a
basic corner stitch.

671
00:30:49,855 --> 00:30:53,811
I can figure out how to sew on my
own buttons, thank you. I am surgeon.

672
00:30:53,816 --> 00:30:54,930
Right.

673
00:30:56,806 --> 00:30:58,300
Oh, for God's sakes.

674
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:02,903
You sew this on for me,
and I'll get rid of Addison and Sloan.

675
00:31:02,938 --> 00:31:04,012
Really?
- No.

676
00:31:04,018 --> 00:31:05,650
Oh, fine. I'll do it anyway.

677
00:31:06,318 --> 00:31:09,050
So I heard you've got a
sister wandering the halls.

678
00:31:09,058 --> 00:31:10,490
She planning on
moving here, too?

679
00:31:10,526 --> 00:31:11,462
God, I hope not.

680
00:31:12,336 --> 00:31:14,130
Derek, I know it's
been hard on you.

681
00:31:15,227 --> 00:31:16,420
He was like my brother.

682
00:31:17,618 --> 00:31:21,290
I have four sisters...
four very annoying sisters.

683
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:25,990
Mark was my brother.
It's--it's hard.

684
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:28,870
Divorce isn't all it's
cracked up to be, huh?

685
00:31:29,647 --> 00:31:30,940
I just want it to be easy.

686
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:33,412
I want it to be
over and move on.

687
00:31:34,986 --> 00:31:38,592
But...
- But you're in a surprising amount of pain.

688
00:31:39,978 --> 00:31:40,932
You and Adele?

689
00:31:41,646 --> 00:31:44,292
I'm sewing on a button for
the first time in my life.

690
00:31:44,608 --> 00:31:48,361
What does that tell you?
- Technically, I'm sewing.

691
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:51,842
I'm just saying.

692
00:31:58,305 --> 00:31:59,403
Dr. Sloan.

693
00:32:00,148 --> 00:32:01,161
So we're clear,

694
00:32:02,227 --> 00:32:03,740
you knew when you stepped
into that surgery,

695
00:32:03,776 --> 00:32:05,833
you were forfeiting your
future in plastics, right?

696
00:32:05,868 --> 00:32:07,813
But, Dr. Sloan--
- I need my phone back.

697
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:17,382
Well done. You really prepared.

698
00:32:18,488 --> 00:32:19,752
Yes, I'm always prepared.

699
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:22,083
Couldn't do it without you.

700
00:32:23,097 --> 00:32:23,993
Thank you.

701
00:32:24,566 --> 00:32:26,970
Dr. Burke, uh,
could we have a moment alone?

702
00:32:29,717 --> 00:32:33,350
I just-- I didn't realize
that you were one of them,

703
00:32:33,657 --> 00:32:36,762
one of the doctors around
here with doubts about me

704
00:32:36,767 --> 00:32:38,681
or my abilities.
- Miranda, I'm not.

705
00:32:38,907 --> 00:32:42,151
My name was erased from the board.
I have to assume that was you.

706
00:32:46,505 --> 00:32:47,910
Dr. Bailey--
- I just--

707
00:32:48,248 --> 00:32:50,362
I just--
I just need to know why.

708
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:54,670
I need you to tell me why you
didn't want me in on your surgery.

709
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:02,202
I'm afraid I just
couldn't use you.

710
00:33:07,265 --> 00:33:08,333
I understand.

711
00:33:23,505 --> 00:33:25,791
Oh, you should've seen that.

712
00:33:25,926 --> 00:33:28,443
Two uteruses.
So unbelievably cool.

713
00:33:28,535 --> 00:33:29,681
And a cute baby to boot.

714
00:33:29,715 --> 00:33:31,763
Well, I'm glad you're
enjoying your trip.

715
00:33:31,898 --> 00:33:35,731
Relax, Derek. I'm going.
I'm on a plane in two hours.

716
00:33:35,738 --> 00:33:39,830
So... you're gonna report back to mom that?
- That you're you.

717
00:33:40,735 --> 00:33:43,763
Still running in circles around
all the women in your life,

718
00:33:43,766 --> 00:33:47,230
but that's to be expected with
four sisters and a dead dad.

719
00:33:47,728 --> 00:33:49,190
I'm not running
around in circles.

720
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:52,120
Derek, can you even remember
the last time you were alone?

721
00:33:52,288 --> 00:33:53,833
You've never been single, ever.

722
00:33:54,016 --> 00:33:56,851
I mean, you're fine,
but you're not happy.

723
00:33:57,055 --> 00:34:00,281
And you're not gonna get happy
until you get some space.

724
00:34:00,537 --> 00:34:03,271
Just get away from Addie,

725
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:05,450
away from the intern,
just away.

726
00:34:05,465 --> 00:34:06,793
Figure out what you want.

727
00:34:09,957 --> 00:34:11,853
Kathleen's the shrink,
Nancy, not you.

728
00:34:16,247 --> 00:34:17,203
I gotta go.

729
00:34:21,987 --> 00:34:22,861
Nancy...

730
00:34:24,906 --> 00:34:26,251
Thanks for flying out here.

731
00:34:26,868 --> 00:34:27,851
It was, uh...

732
00:34:30,465 --> 00:34:31,262
Thanks.

733
00:34:46,886 --> 00:34:48,152
Where are we going again?

734
00:34:48,417 --> 00:34:49,973
We need to go upstairs.

735
00:34:51,888 --> 00:34:52,743
Okay.

736
00:35:04,528 --> 00:35:07,202
Wait. Wait. Where are we?

737
00:35:07,776 --> 00:35:09,680
We're on the psychiatric
floor, Gretchen.

738
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:11,912
We need to place you
on a 72-hour hold.

739
00:35:11,915 --> 00:35:14,692
No, I'm not crazy.
You can't--no. I'm going home.

740
00:35:16,785 --> 00:35:19,563
Gretchen.- No,
you have to let me go home. Please.

741
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:21,740
I'll just--I need to
go back home. Please.

742
00:35:21,747 --> 00:35:23,791
If you go home, you're just
gonna hurt yourself again. Right?

743
00:35:23,825 --> 00:35:24,002
Isn't that your plan, so that you
won't have to take the bar exam?

744
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,570
Isn't that your plan, so that you
won't have to take the bar exam?

745
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:28,351
You need some help, Gretchen.

746
00:35:28,778 --> 00:35:32,932
If the idea of taking an exam makes
you hold your palm to a burner,

747
00:35:33,406 --> 00:35:34,351
you need some help.

748
00:35:34,745 --> 00:35:36,662
Everyone needs help
from time to time,

749
00:35:37,158 --> 00:35:38,603
someone to look out for them,

750
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,342
make sure they're okay,

751
00:35:41,258 --> 00:35:42,510
make sure they're ready.

752
00:35:43,856 --> 00:35:45,062
I have that.

753
00:35:46,297 --> 00:35:47,821
And you need that right now.

754
00:35:54,398 --> 00:35:56,530
I'm not crazy.
- I know.

755
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:59,540
I just... didn't want to fail.
- I know.

756
00:36:01,177 --> 00:36:01,743
I know.

757
00:36:13,907 --> 00:36:15,131
What happened?

758
00:36:17,588 --> 00:36:20,322
Are my babies okay?
- The surgery went very well.

759
00:36:20,327 --> 00:36:21,860
You have a healthy baby boy.

760
00:36:21,867 --> 00:36:23,682
And the labor stopped
on your little girl.

761
00:36:23,717 --> 00:36:25,792
She's gonna be just fine.
- And Greg?

762
00:36:26,497 --> 00:36:27,833
Has Greg come back yet?

763
00:36:28,237 --> 00:36:31,320
No, Noelle, I'm sorry.
Greg isn't here.

764
00:36:36,548 --> 00:36:39,711
I want an update every half-hour, and--
- What happened?

765
00:36:42,415 --> 00:36:43,720
My babies?
- They're just fine.

766
00:36:43,756 --> 00:36:45,730
You're just coming out
of anesthesia, Noelle.

767
00:36:45,768 --> 00:36:47,060
Everything went very well.

768
00:36:47,896 --> 00:36:49,132
Is Greg back yet?

769
00:36:49,945 --> 00:36:51,790
I'm so sorry, Noelle.
He's not here.

770
00:36:56,355 --> 00:36:58,650
And be sure to alert me
to any fetal distress.

771
00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:00,063
What happened?

772
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:01,812
Your babies are
healthy, Noelle.

773
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:02,962
Everything's okay.

774
00:37:03,315 --> 00:37:04,723
Is Greg back yet?

775
00:37:05,898 --> 00:37:06,791
I'm right here.

776
00:37:14,168 --> 00:37:15,063
Hi.

777
00:37:23,247 --> 00:37:24,801
I saw our son.

778
00:37:27,198 --> 00:37:28,352
He's amazing.

779
00:37:33,806 --> 00:37:35,243
But how's our little girl?

780
00:37:52,407 --> 00:37:54,853
You look like you could
use a little cheering up.

781
00:37:55,115 --> 00:37:56,433
Not from you.

782
00:37:56,947 --> 00:37:59,590
Oh, if I recall,
I was pretty good at cheering you up

783
00:38:00,435 --> 00:38:04,531
One, two...
yep, three very cheerful times.

784
00:38:04,538 --> 00:38:06,892
Dirty. It was not
"cheerful." It was dirty.

785
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,430
And like I said, no.

786
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:28,410
So your sister really
doesn't like me, huh?

787
00:38:28,448 --> 00:38:29,962
Sorry. It's just, she's...

788
00:38:31,558 --> 00:38:32,753
from the east coast.

789
00:38:36,816 --> 00:38:37,560
Well, I--

790
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:39,163
you know what?
I shoulda called.

791
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:41,791
But you didn't.

792
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:44,971
I want us to work, it's just--

793
00:38:45,268 --> 00:38:46,521
it's complicated.

794
00:38:50,647 --> 00:38:52,453
I think I need a
little time to...

795
00:38:53,686 --> 00:38:54,900
take some space.

796
00:38:56,245 --> 00:38:57,140
Yeah.

797
00:38:58,467 --> 00:38:59,721
To clear my head.

798
00:39:00,785 --> 00:39:02,881
Yeah. I... okay.

799
00:39:04,855 --> 00:39:06,181
Okay.

800
00:39:08,127 --> 00:39:09,383
Okay.

801
00:39:14,046 --> 00:39:18,521
<i>There are times when even the best
of us have trouble with commitment.</i>

802
00:39:21,036 --> 00:39:21,893
Dr. Stevens.

803
00:39:23,498 --> 00:39:27,240
I was just looking at Dr. Grey's
evaluation on your first day back
to work.

804
00:39:27,397 --> 00:39:28,983
I get daily report cards now?

805
00:39:29,336 --> 00:39:30,430
She had a lot to say.

806
00:39:31,665 --> 00:39:32,713
Yes, Sir.

807
00:39:32,715 --> 00:39:35,392
It was a difficult catch.
Nicely handled.

808
00:39:36,406 --> 00:39:37,452
Good work.

809
00:39:39,817 --> 00:39:41,293
Welcome back, Dr. Stevens.

810
00:39:51,715 --> 00:39:53,703
I was rude to you before.
I'm sorry.

811
00:39:56,147 --> 00:39:59,311
I understand what you're trying to say.
You're the... pig.

812
00:40:00,335 --> 00:40:01,690
You are committed.

813
00:40:04,506 --> 00:40:05,741
Only we broke up.

814
00:40:06,785 --> 00:40:08,553
And I've been wanting to hear
this from you for how long?

815
00:40:08,587 --> 00:40:11,883
And--and you wait until now to say
it to me after we've broken up?

816
00:40:13,205 --> 00:40:16,183
I'm out of my element here.
I break bones for a living.

817
00:40:16,187 --> 00:40:17,780
I-I used to live
in the basement.

818
00:40:17,817 --> 00:40:19,753
Most days I wear last
night's eyeliner to work.

819
00:40:19,787 --> 00:40:21,690
I don't give a crap what
other people think about me

820
00:40:21,725 --> 00:40:24,923
because I am a happily independent,
successful woman,

821
00:40:24,926 --> 00:40:26,080
and I like it that way.

822
00:40:26,517 --> 00:40:29,253
Only when you say stuff like this,
it just...

823
00:40:30,698 --> 00:40:33,411
it just-- it makes things too hard.
So please...

824
00:40:35,158 --> 00:40:36,400
don't chase me anymore...

825
00:40:38,985 --> 00:40:40,580
unless you're
ready to catch me.

826
00:40:45,055 --> 00:40:50,340
<i>And we may be surprised by the
commitments we're willing to let slip

complicated.</i>

828
00:41:04,258 --> 00:41:06,321
