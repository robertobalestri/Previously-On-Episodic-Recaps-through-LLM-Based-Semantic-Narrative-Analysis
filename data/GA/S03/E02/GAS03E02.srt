1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,360
previously on grey's anatomy...

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,730
last night,you and shephard did it.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,340
meredith,what does this mean?

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,130
uh,i had panties on

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,160
Here I thought I was a surgeon,but i'm not.

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,860
- she cut the his IVAD wire.
- so i quit.

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,050
it's time for you to make a choice-- me or this hospital.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,270
good-bye,richard.

9
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,060
you live here?

10
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,450
i'm not crazy or anything.

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,550
i just spend so much time here in the hospital.

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,180
- are you gonna tell shephard about...
- not yet...

13
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,700
what does this mean?

14
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,870
it means you have a choice.

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:44,970
at any given moment,the brain has 14 billion neurons firing at a speed of 450 miles per hour.

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,060
we don't have control over most of them...

17
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:55,640
when we get a chill-- goose bumps,when we get excited-- adrenaline.

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,390
the body naturally follows its impulses,

19
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,900
which i think is part of what makes it so hard for us to control ours.

20
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,350
it's enough muffins.

21
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,740
we don't need all these.

22
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,210
no more muffins.

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,870
of course,sometimes we have impulses we would rather not control...

24
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,680
what are you doing?

25
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,960
just because you can't touch doesn't mean you can't enjoy.

26
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,560
that we later wish we had.

27
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,310
mama.
daddy.

28
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,750
oh,my-- preston.

29
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,770
mama and daddy?!

30
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,700
is this a new service the hospital is providing?

31
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,160
i told you to guard the door!

32
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,270
i had a code blue.

33
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,510
i had parents walk in.

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,980
- we saved the guy's life.
- whatever.

35
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,810
- you know,i want my 20 bucks back.
- sorry.

36
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,960
bought everyone coffee...

37
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,660
to celebrate saving the guy's life.

38
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,540
yeah,i want my 20 bucks back.

39
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,870
it's not tyler's fault you're a dirty,dirty stripper.

40
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,240
- you heard.
- everyone heard...

41
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,350
stripper.

42
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,640
oh,oh,you're one to talk,sleeping with two men.

43
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,530
wrong.

44
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,280
i'm not sleeping with either one of them...

45
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,740
not until i pick one.

46
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,920
if i haven't made a decision by the end of the day,i'm flipping a coin.

47
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,470
a girl can only hold out for so long.

48
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,910
oh,and somehow i'm the dirty stripper?

49
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,090
you two have time to round,or are you too busy getting naked on hospital property?

50
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,650
no,i wasn't naked.
i-i wasn't naked.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,540
you've got a coffee stain on your shirt.

52
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,670
you had a bed on your couch.

53
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,010
hope you're not planning to see patients in your sweat suit

54
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,890
actually,um...

55
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,300
i need the day off.

56
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,810
a day off,for what?

57
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,380
for drinking.

58
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,900
i am feeling the need to do some drinking.

59
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:10,280
actually,i'm feeling the need to do some crying,but my tear ducts seem to be too proud,

60
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,930
so i'm going to do some drinking instead.

61
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,550
- what,no laboring moms today?
- no.

62
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,290
because i think god knows that...

63
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,610
i need to dosome drinking today.

64
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,280
you wanna ta about it,addie,or you just wanna be glib a little longer?

65
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,210
why are you living in your office?

66
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,880
marriage...
is hard.

67
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:44,030
well...
thank goodness mine seems to be just about over.

68
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,300
ms.seabury,what-- what are--

69
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,810
no,i'm--i'm sorry. you cannot be eating.

70
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,330
what is all of this?

71
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,120
this is chocate raspberry souffle cake.

72
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,230
it is the best thing i've ever tasted in my life.

73
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,000
except for maybe the banana cream torte there.

74
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,080
it's pretty stunning,really.

75
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,580
bakeries deliver.
did you know that?please,grab a fork.

76
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,470
ms.seabury,you're scheduled for surgery this afternoon.

77
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,160
we push the surgery a little.
tomorrow,maybe?

78
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,810
oh,my god.
you've gotta taste this.

79
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,090
ma'am,you have an aggressive form of lung cancer.

80
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,920
the sooner we get you into surgery,

81
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,500
- the better your chances--
- the better my chances of surviving.

82
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,250
so i heard.
it's all very aggressive.

83
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,450
i mean,it's very...

84
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,160
it's funny.

85
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,370
i have never smoked a cigarette in my life.

86
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,350
i have never smoked pot.

87
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,740
i've never drank.

88
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,390
before today,i hadn't had a dessert in ten years.

89
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,620
i am the picture of health,and i have lung cancer.

90
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,670
i mean,come on.
it's absurd,right?

91
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,440
i'm sorry.i think i'm on a sugar high.

92
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,210
i'm sorry.

93
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,450
o'malley,reschedule her surgery for tomorrow and get her a psych consult.

94
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,020
yes,sir.
and no more food deliveries.

95
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,750
yes,sir.

96
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,330
okay.

97
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,380
you do it.

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,630
so,um...
um,dr.bailey?

99
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,320
surgeons don't say "um," o'malley.

100
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,870
you want to be a surgeon,learn to speak like one.

101
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,160
look,he wants you to talk to the chief about izzie,see if she can come back.

102
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,740
she's just baking-- a lot of baking-

103
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:23,720
and it seems a waste for all her talent and medical skills to go into muffins.

104
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,880
- we just thought u might be willing to help.
- stop...talking.

105
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,240
well,good morning.
benjamin,ruth.

106
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,350
good morning,dr.shepherd.

107
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,420
it doesn't feel like a very good morning to me.

108
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,110
i have to have brain surgery today.

109
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,370
pretty scary.

110
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,760
plus,my sister is nervous.

111
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,270
when she gets nervous,she sweats,and the windows in here don't open,so it's pretty rank.

112
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,190
benjamin.

113
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,820
was i rude,ruthie?

114
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,070
let's let the doctors talk.

115
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,540
benjamin o'leary,32,

116
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,740
in for the removal of a brain tumor that's pressing on his frontal temporal lobe.

117
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,790
clearly,it's affecting his impulse control.

118
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,590
it makes me say everything i think,which apparently is annoying.

119
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,270
this doctor looks annoyed,anyway.

120
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,340
although,it's hard to tell 'cause she always has kind of a pinched,uptight look on her face.

121
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,780
am i annoying you?

122
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,640
it's fine.

123
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,100
you can't say it's fine.

124
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,000
he doesn't perceive sarcasm or irony.

125
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,890
if he's annoying you,you have to tell him.

126
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,620
maybe i'm not annoying her,ruthie.

127
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,200
- no,you are.
- dr.yang.

128
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,970
- he asked.

129
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,480
- okay,benjamin,dr.yang--

130
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,740
pinched and annoyed though she may b-is nna prep you for surgery today.

131
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,050
do you have any questions for me?

132
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,590
is that blonde your girlfriend?

133
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,210
'cause the way you keep looking at her,you might as well just mount her right here and now.

134
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,970
i'm sorry.
was that rude?

135
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,510
i'm proud of you all.

136
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,200
you make me proud.

137
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,670
you reflect on me well.

138
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,140
grey,if you think you can keep your clothes on long enough to follow up the labs,

139
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,630
i'd appreciate it. karev,cover the pit.

140
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,840
wait,the pit?

141
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:52,860
i'm--i'm off gynie?

142
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,920
dr.montgomery-shepherd is out sick.

143
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,890
you can cover the pit,or you can...

144
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:06,090
you can tell me whose damn panties are on the bulletin board!

145
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,780
yours?

146
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,730
this is a hospital,people.

147
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,570
serious work happens here.

148
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,370
we save lives he-- oh,something funny?

149
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,320
whose are these?

150
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,290
this is bad.
this isn't good.

151
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,970
well,you better claim them.

152
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,320
- she thinks they're mine.claim them!
- no!

153
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,850
yeah,i know it's one of you.

154
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,940
it's always one of mine.always.

155
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:38,320
so tell me,which one of you left your damn drawers on my surgical floor!

156
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,380
oh,no.did i leave my underwear lying around again?

157
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,040
i am so sorry,bailey.

158
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,640
it's,uh,it's my bad.

159
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,370
o'malley,yang,prep your patient for surgery.

160
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,940
karev,pit.
grey,charts.

161
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,980
all four of you,do not make me regret setting you loose in this hospital.

162
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,400
o'malley,what do i mean by that?

163
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,900
you mean check with you before we cut any wires or steal any hearts.

164
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,960
are you trying to be clever?

165
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,250
- no,ma'am.
- better not be.

166
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,150
holy crap.the nazi's definitely back.

167
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,600
and louder than ever.

168
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,130
oh,mrs. burke.
hi,i'm cristina.

169
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,500
i-i may have said that earlier,but i was,um--

170
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,860
did i hear you refer to miranda bailey as a nazi?

171
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,490
what?
oh,no.

172
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,010
oh,uh,uh,i mean,yes,but--

173
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,720
you do understand that the nazis were responsible

174
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,100
for the worst genocide in the history of man?

175
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,840
and a racist genocide at that.

176
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:44,100
i would think that as a woman of color and as a doctor,no less,

177
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,690
that you would think twice before using that word as a punch line.

178
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,030
i'll think about that in the future,mrs. burke.

179
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,920
mrs. burke?preston's mother?

180
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,700
yes.oh.and you are?

181
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,940
derek shepherd.i'm the surgeon who operated on your son.

182
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,130
oh,thank you.

183
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,260
brilliant surgeon.

184
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,850
and a handsome man,too.

185
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,880
your mother must be very proud.

186
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,080
do you mind,dr.shepherd,if i borrow your young intern for a quick cup of coffee?

187
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,870
- i'll bring her right back.
- oh,no problem.

188
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,450
dr.grey can cover for cristina.

189
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,460
- i'm sorry?
- uh,dr.grey is very busy.

190
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,830
she has charts to do for bailey.

191
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,110
bailey's on the warpath.

192
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,280
uh,not the german warpath.

193
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,990
it's a hospital warpath.
it's--it's--

194
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,480
i'll take care of bailey,okay?

195
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,120
enjoy your coffee date,ladies.

196
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,370
- very nice meeting you.
- thank you.

197
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,950
i'll,um...

198
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:37,530
i just have this one quick-- i will meet you in the cafeteria in a couple of minutes.

199
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,370
is that--is that all right?

200
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,200
- yes,i look forward to it.
- oh,good.

201
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,990
well,this is a change from the elevator,

202
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,350
i mean a little more public.i like it.

203
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,520
you're married.you're married,and you said things to me.

204
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,200
yes,i said things to you.

205
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,850
normally,i would like the things you said to me.

206
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,130
normally,i would even think the bulletin board thing was funny.

207
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,090
bulletin board?
what are you talking about?

208
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,660
but you're married,which makes none of this normal.

209
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,240
it makes me a home wrecker.

210
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,510
and i hate the fact that i'm a home wrecker.

211
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,040
meredith,i'm not gonna pressure you.

212
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,350
take all the time you need.

213
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,280
but just so you have all the information,

214
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,450
my home was wrecked well before you came into the picture,

215
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,630
and i am just now done trying to rebuild it.

216
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,170
- you're done?
- i'm done.

217
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,730
whatever you decide,i am ending it with addison...

218
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,010
today.

219
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,340
you have said this before.

220
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,590
i know,but this time i mean it.

221
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,880
i'm gonna come clean just as soon as i see her.

222
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,760
- you are?
- i am.

223
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:02,020
you guys should think about getting a hotel room or something.

224
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,610
your mother wants to have coffee with me.

225
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,870
- and?
- and...she thinks i'm a racist.

226
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,270
oh,and a stripper.

227
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,630
she thinks i'm a racist stripper.

228
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,030
oh,come on.
what's funny?

229
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,270
this is not funny.

230
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,180
it's kind of funny.

231
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,240
she's just my mama,cristina.

232
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,530
your "mama"?

233
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,130
you'll love her when you get to know her.

234
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,270
everybody loves my mama.

235
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,520
you will save me from this,okay?

236
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,600
you will save me from this or...

237
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,390
you will save me.

238
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,640
hey,uh,chief,you haven't heard from addison,have you?

239
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,110
she's not answering any phones.

240
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,820
actually,she needed a day off.

241
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:13,950
something about finding another woman's panties in the pocket of your tux.

242
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,130
oh,that's-- that's not how i wanted her to find out.

243
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,710
you don't leave another woman's panties in your tux unless you want her to find 'em.

244
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,350
- i know,i know.
- look,i know a thing or two about affairs.

245
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,400
i even know a thing or two about affairs with women named grey.

246
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,150
it's not an affair.

247
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,590
see,i was gonna tell her.

248
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,480
addison--i was gonna tell her today.
i was gonna end it.

249
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,390
- look,give her some space.
- no.

250
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,350
- give her some time.
- no.

251
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,870
that's not it.
no.

252
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,890
no,i gotta-- i gotta talk to her today.

253
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,010
if something's over,it's just gotta be over.

254
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,340
meredith,she's-- she's not an affair.

255
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,620
ruthie,i don't think i want this surger you have to have the surgery,ben.

256
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,450
right.

257
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,710
you're very pretty,but you look kinda tired,

258
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,000
and i think maybe you should change your hair conditioner.

259
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,640
- that was rude,benjamin.
- it is?

260
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,530
no,actually,it's true,and it's refreshing.

261
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,730
- do you have sex with that brain surgeon?
- benjamin.

262
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,440
it's okay.
nope,i haven't.

263
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,790
not today,anyway.

264
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,900
i would.
he's hot...

265
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,330
and arrogant in way that's still sexy.

266
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,450
i would totally have sex with him if i could.

267
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,100
looked like you could.

268
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,780
so what'the holdup?

269
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,950
are you trying to seduce me?

270
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,280
i was just wondering--'cause i got a lot of work to do-- mm-hmm.

271
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,840
but,uh,i was just wondering about,uh,the panties-- the panties that are yours--

272
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,220
and how they ended up on the bulletin board.

273
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,510
black,lacy panties on the board.

274
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,760
- you are trying to seduce me.
- no.no,i'm not.

275
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,870
i'm just wondering how,uh,panties that i haven't seen before--

276
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,920
and i've seen your panties a lot of days in a r now--

277
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,140
i'm just wondering how black panties that apparently belong to you

278
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,180
and i've never seen end up on the bulletin board.

279
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,450

280
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,430

281
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,130

00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:19,170

283
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,520

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,570

00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,920

287
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:34,700

i don't know.

289
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,310

00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,930

00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,800
- it's fine,dr.bailey.
- he's my intern.

292
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,440
i say it's not fine.

293
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,530
no.

294
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,600
what's not clear?

295
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,920
what's not clear to me is why you won't talk to izzie.

296
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,280
- that's what's not clear.
- really?

297
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,740
you want to push me on this today?

298
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,120
today you want to push me?

299
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,810
what do we got,jill?

300
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,220
harley hernandez,14,was street luging when he lost control and hit a car.

301
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,930
witnesses say he was catapulted at least 20 feet into the air,

302
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,790
landed on a pile of tree trimmings.

303
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:06,850
broken pvis apparentas are,i would gu and then suddenly--wham.

304
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,720
it's all right,harley.
you're at the hospital.

305
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,440
we're gonna take care of you now,okay?

306
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,520
hospital?
what's the matter with me?

307
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,870
you're an idiot.
that's what's the matter.

308
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,420
- dad.
- sir.sir,please back away.

309
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,760
your friends are idiots,and you don't use the sense god gave you!

310
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,550
that's what's the matter with you!

311
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,740
sir,you're blocking our path.
please!

312
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,180
you okay?
sorry about that.

313
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,890
- sir,ir.
- you son of a bitch.

314
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,890
- where's my son?
- we took him in there.

315
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,920
- he was blocking the paramedics.
- no,he is terrified.

316
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,390
his child is a tree!

317
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,450
alex,listen to me.

318
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,920
you will not get physical with another human being on my watch ever again,

319
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,550
you will not question my authority,

320
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,410
and you will not defend your little girlfriend for killing a man!

321
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,810
are we clear?!

322
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,660
she's not my girlfriend.

323
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,480
as you know,i'm sure,he graduated first in his class from tulane.

324
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,850
i-i did know that.

325
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,500
actually,i graduated first in my class at stanford.

326
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:21,330
so you are planning to pursue a less time-consuming specialty--

327
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,880
obstetrics,perhaps,or family medicine?

328
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,760
oh,i'm in the surgical program.

329
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,570
but after you're married.

330
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,070
married?
uh,i'm sorry.married?

331
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,280
come,cristina.

332
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,650
you must have considered the possibility.

333
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,960
you're no spring chicken.

334
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:39,020
i don't know a young woman who wouldn't want to marry my preston given half the chance.

335
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,910
he's handsome.
he's brilliant.

336
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,270
he is the best thing i've ever done in my life.

337
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,170
he is the most important thing in the world to me.

338
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,830
oh.okay.

339
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,390
oh,burke.
burke.burke's here.

340
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,920
preston is-- preston burke is here.

341
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,960

344
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,690
i wanted to get some,uh,i-- stretch my legs,mama.

345
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,110
but you're not suppose to stretch your legs.

346
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,540
you're supposed to be resting.

347
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,330
right.

348
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,790
but i wanted to have,uh,some air...

349
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,880
some stretching,some air and some coffee.

350
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,440
anybody want any coffee?

351
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,400
we already have coffee.

352
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:29,910
- please have a seat.
- right.just a second.

353
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,850
- you did this.
- did what?

354
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,640
cristina,listen to me.

355
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,300
it's not that i don't like you.

356
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,910
i think you're a very smart,very attractive young woman.

357
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,000
- but you're selfish.
- i beg your pardon.

358
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:45,370
oh,you pulled him out of aickbed because you were uncomfortable.

359
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,890
that's selfish.

360
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,640
you're selfish and my son is giving.

361
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:57,790
and the combination,well,it's not gonna last,not much longer.

362
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,330
hey,hey,hi.
all right.all right.

363
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,180
i brought you a scone,mama.

364
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,610
his kidney's gone.

365
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,230
there's no way to save it.

366
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,180
just focus on keeping the renal artery under control.

367
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,340
i have another bleeder.

368
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,940
okay,pace yourself,everybody.

369
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,860
we got long way to go.

370
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,790
- we have enough blood standing by?
- yes,sir.

371
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,560
is that a tree?

372
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:29,080
his mother rivals my mother,and that is saying something.

373
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,040
they're ating around both othem,

374
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,280
dark and evil.

375
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,800
you're blocking my view,george.

376
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,760
i miss dirty stripper cristina.

377
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,020
she was fun...
a lot less angry.

378
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:42,620
next time i see her,if she even looks at my sideways,i'm telling her what i think.

379
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,750
she wants to call me racist?

380
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,670
- wh--
- yeah.okay?

381
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,570
i'll call her sexist.

382
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,800
change my career after i'm married?

383
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,900
what is this,1953?

384
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,090
if she comes at me,i'm goin' there.

385
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,890
i think you should.

386
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,400
i think we all should just go there.

387
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,310
you know,tell the truth,spit it out,go with your gut,follow your instincts.

388
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,520
i miss philandering whore meredith.

389
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,590
she was trashy and much less idyllic.

390
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,870
do women have two sets of panties?

391
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,210
you know,two sets they wear for different occasions?

392
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,800
i made a choice.

393
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,170
i'm picking derek.

394
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,180
finn is great.
but derek is...

395
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,690
derek.
and...

396
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,320
- i'm following my gut.
- yeah,whatever.

397
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,990
i-i want my patient back.

398
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,600
you know,the one you stole after...
mama cornered me?

399
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,140
well,that's fine.

400
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,520
it's my day to check on izzie anyway.

401
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,880
you paged me?

402
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:40,980
your patient was caught hoplifting chocolates from the hospital gift shop.

403
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,750
what?

404
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,360
i'd never done that before.
it was exhilarating.

405
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,990
and now she's planning to leave.

406
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,580
leave?
you can't le-- she can't leave.

407
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,540
you're sick.

408
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,910
you should be sleeping and resting.

409
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,030
- and preparing for death?
- preparing for surgery.

410
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,870
- there's a difference.
- maybe.maybe not.

411
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:01,180
that's what they mean when they give you a 60% chance of surval.

412
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:04,920
it means that 4 out of 10 people die whether they have the surgery or not.

413
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,910
i have lived my entireife pent-up,repressed,stifling every impulse,

414
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,790
foowing every rule,and now i'm done.and you know what?

415
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,560
you should be,too.
we should all be done.

416
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,990
- so you're leaving?
- i'm claiming my life,doctor.

417
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,450
i can't do that from a hospital bed.

418
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,490
and you know you'll die.

419
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,940
maybe.

420
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:27,410
but at least when i do,i'll know that i have lived.

421
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,630
oh,god,this is good.

422
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,920
izzie?

423
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,000
wow.

424
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,110
okay.

425
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,410
- finn.
- hi.

426
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,560
wh-what are you doing home?
i thought you were working.

427
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,230
i am.
i'm--i was.i-i still am.

428
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,610
i just came home to check on izzie.

429
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,880
oh,so did i.

430
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,920
i brought her lunch.

431
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,840
you brought izzie lunch.

432
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,750
when my wife died,uh...

433
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:09,520
there really wasn't anything anne could say,but,uh...

434
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,780
the bringing of food actually helped.

435
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,110
it w the only thing that helped.

436
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,180
- you brought izzie food.
- yeah.

437
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,570
even though you didn't think i was here.

438
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,200
is--is that okay?

439
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,020
yeah.
it's amazing,actually.

440
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,150
you're amazing...

441
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,130
sweet and thoughtful and sensitive.

442
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,790
meredith,i don't want to pressure you.

443
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,130
you have a decision to make,and i want you to take all the time you need.

444
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,070
but i do want to make one thing clear.

445
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,800
what's that?

446
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:43,190
i'm not all that sensitive.

447
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,160
so...

448
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,910
so...

449
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,220
have a nice day of work.

450
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,140
mr. hernandez.

451
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,800
h-how is he?
is he okay?

452
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,170
i mean,you've been operating for hours.

453
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,810
there is extensive damage.

454
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,840
we've had to remove one of his kidneys and a portion of his bowel.

455
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,930
but the tree's out.
i mean,you got it out,and he's okay.

456
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,470
okay,mr. hernandez,the branch actually is still there.

457
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,620
we're operating around it,which is part of what's taking so much time.

458
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,950
his mother's not here yet.
i mean...

459
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,120
you think-- you think he'll be okay by the time she gets here?

460
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,930
i-i'm sorry,i do have to get back in there.

461
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,110
but i just wanted to give you an update.

462
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,320
that he's still alive.

463
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,290
yes,that he's still alive.

464
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,940
okay.
okay.

465
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,070
izzie.
how you doin',sweetie?

466
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:08,680
- i brought you some muffins.
- okay.

467
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,900
i made a lot,and i was...

468
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,410
running out of room,and i thought maybe...

469
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,250
you would like some.

470
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,440
i'm a good baker.

471
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,480
yeah.
absolutely.thank you.

472
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,800
dr.stevens.

473
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,380
please don't call me "doctor."
okay...

474
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,740
please don't call me "mrs. shepherd."

475
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,450
that's funny.

476
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,060
- she's drunk.
- this is true.

477
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:39,740
so did you know about the slutty sex your slutty friend had with my...

478
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,410
super slutty husband?

479
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,620
you should have a muffin.

480
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,530
they're really good,and...

481
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,750
they'll help you.

482
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,930
i may be beyond help

483
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,550
yeah.me,too.

484
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,770
don't let hedrive,joe.

485
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,480
good.

486
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,090
but i knew.
i knew that you...

487
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,980
she's still here.

488
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,770
never leaves.

489
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,140
she never even pees.

490
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,390
i'm not entirely sure she's human.

491
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,240
finn brought izzie lunch.

492
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,360
oh,you went to see izzie?

493
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,590
yeah,she wasn't home.

494
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:24,000
but i'm taking that as a good thing,'cause at least the baking has stopped.

495
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:27,110
but my point is that finn brought izzie lunch.

496
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,870
he's that guy-- the guy who brings your roommate lunch when she's sad.

497
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,930
so,uh,you didn't end it?

498
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,210
he's the guy who brings your roommate lunch when she's sad.

499
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,280
so i'm gonna end it with derek.

500
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,770
whatever.

501
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,980
you know,i am not selfish.

502
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,420
i am by his side.

503
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,360
i-i took off all my clothes this morning.
that's not selfish.

504
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,430
and i'm going in for surgery.

505
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,160
selfish people don't save lives.
for surgery.

506
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,270
- george.
- what?

507
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,770
you're flirting with that nurse.

508
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,900
i'm young.
i'm healthy.

509
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,240
i got a life to live.

510
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,760
is this about the panties?

511
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,270
are you still jealous?

512
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,460
i'm not jealous.

513
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,710
i'm just living my life.

514
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,290

515
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,670
do you have a boyfriend?

516
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,740
do you have a boyfriend?

517
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,550
he's gonna keep asking till you answer.

518
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,650
yes,i have a boyfriend.
can you look here?

519
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,830
if i had a boyfriend,i would definitely not be as angry as you.

520
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,710
why are you so angry?

521
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,580
is it because you're frigid?

522
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,760
or he's frigid?

523
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,250
- or--
- nobody's frigid.

524
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,910
my boyfriend's mother called me selfish,okay?

525
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,350
are you selfish?

526
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,680
- 'cause you do seem kind of self-obsessed to me.
- ben.

527
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,250
hey,i'm a surgeon.

528
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:47,420
in order to be a surgeon,a certain amount of self-obsession is necessary.

529
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,620
my boyfriend gets that.

530
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,440
if his mother doesn't,it's her problem.

531
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,700
i used to have a boyfriend.

532
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,330
when i got the tumor,he understood.

533
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,060
he tried to understand.

534
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,610
he loved me.

535
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,710
but his mother didn't.

536
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,670
my offending everyone offended her.

537
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,230
and he said he didn't care what his mother thought.

538
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,350
but in the end,he did care.

539
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,440
'cause now it's two years later,and i'm having brain surgery,

540
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,330
and only my fat sister ruth is with me.

541
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,510
benjamin...

542
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,280
that was kinda rude.

543
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,170
sorry.

544
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,980
when the tumor's removed,is it gonna bring his old personality back?

545
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:35,280
if we get the tumor out and benjamin lives,anything else is icing on the cake.

546
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,630
i'm locking down the external fixator.

547
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,310
there's no active bleeding,and the trajectory is clear.

548
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,960
karev,i want you to hold pressure on the liver.

549
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,800
put your hands down in here,and don't move.

550
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:51,790
you with the saw,

551
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,030
don't make aove until we get our hands on every vital organ around the tree trunk.

552
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,710
the parents-- have they said their good-byes?

553
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,080
mom's not here yet.

554
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,290
and the father was too busy blaming him to say good-bye.

555
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,730
speak when you're spoken to,karev.

556
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,340
i've had enough out of you today.

557
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,060
all due respect,dr.bailey,i think you got me mixed up with izzie stevens.

558
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,650
all right,everybody.
take your positions.

559
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,190
cut carefully.

560
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,900
we'll get this thing out in pieces.

561
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,160
you see that right there?

562
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:27,120
it's too close to the cavernous sinus.

563
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,250
suction.

564
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,640
i've got a bleeder.

565
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,090
the brain is starting to swell.

566
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,940
- v-fib.
- his heart can't take it.

567
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,680
yang,get in there with those paddles.
move.now.go.

568
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,150
clear.

569
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,130
renal artery's collapsed.

570
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:45,990
i thought you had that.

571
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,030
hepatic artery's gone.

572
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,940
b.p.is dropping.
all right,he's bleeding.

573
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,600
damn it,he's bleeding fast.
laps.

574
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,780
- come on.come on.
- no change.

575
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,160
epi and atropine are in.

576
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,540
- still in v-fib.
- shock him again.

577
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:10,630
i've decided that i'm gonna get really fat,

578
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:14,300
just as a stopgap,just until i figure out another plan.

579
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:23,910
i'm gonna eat all of these muffins,and i'm gonna get really,gloriously fat.

580
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:28,880
it's over.over.over.

581
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,370
i'm talking about the last third of my life,miranda.

582
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:35,490
how can that just be over?
how does that just end...

583
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,440
over a skanky pair of panties and...

584
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,270
- a bad tux?i am desir,amanda
- miranda.

585
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,410
right.

586
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,480
joe...

587
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,770
i'm desirable,right?

588
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,060
i have a boyfriend.

589
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:53,360
be that as it may,i don't need me to tell you how wildly attractive i am-- wildly attractive.

590
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,870
you are...

591
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:58,520
and your wildly attractive cab is here.

592
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,580
it is?

593
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,370
you told me to call you a cab at 10:00.

594
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,090
it's 10:00.

595
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,030
i guess that's for the best,huh?

596
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,370
i would say so.

597
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,710
hey.

598
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,590
can i buy you a drink?
i have a lot of them.

599
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,890
i'm trying one of everything.

600
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,680
hey.
hey,aren't you the cake lady from this morning?

601
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,060
aren't you supposed to be having surgery?

602
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,640
oh,well,that hasn't been decided yet.

603
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,780
so you're a doctor?

604
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:27,230
yes,i'm a doctor.

605
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,740
does that mean you can't drink with me?

606
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,650
not at all.

607
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,730
joe.

608
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,530
george...
you're gonna kill someone.

609
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,470
what are you doing?
i'm workin' it.

610
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,330
callie can be bad,so can i?

611
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,890
hey,watch it.

612
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,490
george...
callie is hot.

613
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,670
she's,like,really sexy,like,almost dirty-hot,and she's hot for you.

614
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,790
maybe you could keep using the darts as weapons,

615
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:05,860
or you could go get lucky with the sexy,hot,dirty girl.

616
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,590
where is hgoing?

617
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,670
to get laid.

618
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,730
god,you know,there is something wrong in the world when bambi's getting laid,

619
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,930
and i can't get five minutes alone with burke.

620
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,330
- what are you doing?
- day's over.

621
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,550
flippin' a coin.

622
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,880
call it.

623
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,730
the brain surgeon should be heads.

624
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,460
right.

625
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,540
choice made.

626
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,040
oh,that's it?

627
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,030
you're gonna base your choice on flipping a coin?

628
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,540
i'm taking a cue from benjamin.

629
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,910
impulsive,hont-- it's my new motto.

630
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,450
benjamin died.

631
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,650
he wasn't impulsive,meredith.
he wasn't honest.

632
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,590
he was sick and brain damaged.

633
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,990
and now he's dead.

634
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,110
mr. hernandez.

635
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,370
uh,may i?

636
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,730
you--you okay?

637
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:19,890
your son,he's gonna be fine.

638
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,480
he was off with his friends.

639
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,640
i let him go off with that thing.

640
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:29,460
i knew better.
i knew better.

641
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,040
his friend,he has this driveway up on a hill.

642
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,710
i just keep picturing him.

643
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,000
i keep picturing him going down that hill and...

644
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,120
and i didn't stop him,and i shouldstopped m.

645
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,510
kids spin outta control sometimes.

646
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,990
they...
spin outta control.

647
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,100
- you can't--
- yes,you can.

648
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,170
you can control them.

649
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,400
it's your job as a parent to control them.

650
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:07,880
ever sincehe divorce,i only get to see him every other weekend.

651
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,410
i never woulda bought him that luge.

652
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,740
i never woulda let him go off on his own that way before.

653
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,830
i went soft.

654
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:22,890
i went soft when he needed me to be the father.

655
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,040
i wish i'd had more fun.

656
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,360
i didn't want to be a ut.

657
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,710
didn't want to be a tramp.

658
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,090
didn't have any fun.

659
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,360
my ex-husband,he had fun--

660
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,990
all sorts of fun with all sorts of women who were a lot more fun than me.

661
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,030
nobody ever called him a slut.

662
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,500
why is that?

663
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,100
men can do it,but women can't.

664
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,180
women can.
i know some who do.

665
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,660
not without getting called names.

666
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,870
what do you care what people call you?

667
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,300
i get called an ass.
i don't care.

668
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,780
i don't think you're an ass.

669
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:59,650
i don't think you're a slut.

670
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,170
do y have a girlfriend,alex?

671
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,970
no,no girlfriend.

672
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,960
so you're single?

673
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:11,190
s,definitely.

674
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:14,680
- i'm single.
- i'm single,too.

675
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:20,860
and i'm very bad at this,never having had any practice.

676
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,330
so,um,i am...

677
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:30,310
i'm gonna go into the bathroom,and if i find myself alone in there after two minutes,

678
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,700
i'll just touch up my makeup and come back out.

679
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:40,060
but should you have any interest in fulfilling the wish of a potentially dying woman,

680
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,650
you know where i'll be.

681
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,170
getting some exercise,dr.torres?

682
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:26,570
Yes, yes, sir. Chief whatever.

683
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,880
- hi.
- hi.

684
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:54,670
finn.

685
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,680

686
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,540
thanks for coming.

687
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,050
both of you,thanks for coming.

688
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:03,570
so here's the thing...

689
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,260
i like you.

690
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,860
and i like you.

691
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,740
and i thought i had a choice to make.

692
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:12,200
i thought i had to decide.

693
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:16,500
but i think i owe myself the chance to consider my options.

694
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,020
- options?
- options?

695
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,410
there's this thing that allows for the considering of options.

696
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,050
in the olden days,they called it dating.

697
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,030
- dating.
- yes.

698
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,670
i'd like to try that.

699
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,600
- you wanna try dating.
- yes.

700
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,420
- both of us?
- yes.

701
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,080
and i understand if you're not up for it.

702
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,830
but i really hope you are.

703
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,300
you bowing out?

704
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:53,130
no.you?

705
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,750
i don't think so.

706
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:01,450
you're here first,you get all the best cases.

707
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,100
trauma comes in the middle of the night,you get first dibs.

708
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,220
exactly.

709
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,840
yeah,i respect it,i do.

710
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,830
and also,i can't have it.

711
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,220
and you know that.

712
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,350
you're throwing me out?

713
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,550
got no choice.

714
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:18,130
this violates all sorts of codes,and you know it.

715
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,080
so i have to go,but you're allowed to live in your office?

716
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,400
you noticed that,huh?

717
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,330
yeah,i'm pretty observant.

718
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:30,220
guess if i'm throwing you out,i have to follow my own rule.

719
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,100
okay,i'm jealous.

720
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:37,410
but i have a right to be jealous,because i don't want other guys touching your panties.

721
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,890
great.
that's great.

722
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:48,750
- you might wanna clear that up.
- yes,sir.

723
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,510
You heading out,dana?

724
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,320
gotta get back to the hospital,joe.

725
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,350
gotta go kick this cancer's ass.

726
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,930
okay.

727
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,330
Joe, ??

728
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,770
hey,alex.

729
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,690
uh,about today--

730
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,090
dr.bailey,you were right.

731
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,250
i-i shouldn't be getting physical with patients.

732
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:19,590
the body is a slave to its impulses.

733
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,000
i don't know if it's gonna get y better,mama.

734
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:29,550
well,i do,baby.
i do know.

735
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,630
cristina,it's late.

736
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,430
preston needs his sleep.

737
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,810
but the thing that makes us human...

738
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,860
i'm sorry,mrs. burke.

739
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:47,970
i was just coming in to see if either of you needed anything before i went home for the evening.

740
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,310
is what we can control.

741
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,590
we're fine.

742
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,510
good night,preston.

743
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,500
sleep well.

744
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:08,370
hang in there.

745
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,100
after the storm...
after the rush...

746
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,930
after the heat of the moment has passed...

747
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,510
- the panties?
- yeah.

748
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:23,210
- not mine.
- yeah?

749
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,110
- the jealousy?
- yeah.

750
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,190
insanely hot.

751
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:34,790
what's with the suitcase?

752
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:40,820
we can cool off and clean up the messes we've made.

753
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:47,800
i'm busy,you guys.
leave me alone.

754
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,290
izzie.

755
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,280
i went soft.

756
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,460
i...

757
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:22,820
had a baby,and i swore it wouldn't change me,it does change you.

758
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:28,970
i got tired,i got busy,and i stopped teaching.

759
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:33,480
i stopped teaching when you needed a teacher the most.

760
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,430
- you couldn't have stopped me.
- yes,i could've.

761
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:40,890
you couldn't have stopped you,but i could have.

762
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:43,950
and in the past,i would have.

763
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,880
i went soft.

764
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:55,010
and i'm partly to blame for what happened,so...

765
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:00,370
i want you to come back.

766
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,710
you will talk to thief.

767
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:12,270
we'll work it out,because you're talented,and you're capable,and we all make mistakes,

768
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:17,660
and-- and it's enough muffins.

769
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:24,210
we can try to let go of what was...

770
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,280
i thought you were room service.

771
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,800
i feel terrible.

772
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,800
i'm not proud of what i did.

773
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,300
you deserve better.

774
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:48,900
and i'm sorry about the...

775
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:52,300
sorry about the panties...

776
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,730
and the prom.

777
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,910
i-i'm sorry i did that.

778
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,510
yeah.

779
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,340
i'm sorry you did that,too.

780
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,090
our marriage is over.

781
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,590
yeah,i guess it is.

782
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,920
it's a my fault.

783
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:26,590
god,this is incredibly sad.

784
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,420
i'm incredibly sad.

785
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,700
and then again...

786
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,380
oh.

787
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,030
well,this is awkward.

788
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,380
i feel much better now.
