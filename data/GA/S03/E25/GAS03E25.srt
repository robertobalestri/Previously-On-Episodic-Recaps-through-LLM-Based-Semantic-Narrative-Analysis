1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,488
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,603 --> 00:00:04,449
You people are taking a test
that will determine the course

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:05,961
of your entire medical careers.

4
00:00:05,962 --> 00:00:07,090
You want a big wedding ?

5
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:07,466
Yes.

6
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:09,876
I know you think I have feelings
for you, but I don't.

7
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:12,175
Search and rescue found
those lost climbers.

8
00:00:12,176 --> 00:00:13,102
One's still missing.

9
00:00:13,103 --> 00:00:15,809
Tell me the truth. Do you remember ?
Do you know who you are ?

10
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:17,990
He's making his recommendation
to the board tomorrow

11
00:00:17,992 --> 00:00:20,148
for chief of surgery and chief resident.

12
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:22,634
- You're adopting ?
- She hasn't actually picked us yet.

13
00:00:22,636 --> 00:00:24,213
This heartburn, it's like it...

14
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:25,291
Oh, no.

15
00:00:25,295 --> 00:00:25,951
Fourth climber.

16
00:00:25,956 --> 00:00:27,991
Is that an ax in his head ?

17
00:00:27,996 --> 00:00:32,702
- If Richard finds out that you're
carrying another man's baby...
- Somebody help !

18
00:00:36,825 --> 00:00:39,791
<i>Being chief is about responsibility.<i>

19
00:00:40,115 --> 00:00:44,192
Every single surgical patient in the
hospital is your patient,

20
00:00:44,568 --> 00:00:46,850
whether you're the one
who cut them open or not.

21
00:00:46,868 --> 00:00:49,300
Come on. She's lost a lot of blood.
The scalpel stops with you.

22
00:00:49,306 --> 00:00:53,063
Start 2 large bore I.V.S
and bolus 2 liters L.R.

23
00:00:53,065 --> 00:00:55,302
You need to be able
to look at a family...

24
00:00:55,365 --> 00:00:56,780
Ready ? One, two...

25
00:00:56,788 --> 00:01:00,603
and tell them your team did everything
they could to save someone's child...

26
00:01:00,608 --> 00:01:02,642
get me a stat E.K.G. And a
portable chest, Brooke.

27
00:01:02,648 --> 00:01:04,680
She's 34 weeks pregnant with twins.

28
00:01:04,687 --> 00:01:05,470
Their husband...

29
00:01:05,477 --> 00:01:07,003
you guys, why don't you go have a seat

30
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:08,790
- in the waiting room ?
- We're not leaving her.

31
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:11,181
Their wife.

32
00:01:12,897 --> 00:01:13,782
What happened ?

33
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:14,951
I don't know.

34
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:17,031
I found her unconscious.
You get caught up...

35
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,690
taking care of other people'families.

36
00:01:20,697 --> 00:01:23,111
She's lost blood, a lot of blood.

37
00:01:23,138 --> 00:01:24,792
And the responsibility,

38
00:01:25,648 --> 00:01:26,451
it makes you...

39
00:01:26,457 --> 00:01:29,201
I didn't even know she was in the
hospital. What was she doing here ?

40
00:01:29,397 --> 00:01:32,991
You take care of other
people's families...

41
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:37,792
<i>and you sacrifice your own.<i>

42
00:01:38,406 --> 00:01:41,592
I thought I was gonna hate this party
game thing, but it's kinda great.

43
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:43,642
Can we set her on fire after ?

44
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:44,931
No, we cannot.

45
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:47,280
Okay, these wedding vows
are not all gonna fit on here.

46
00:01:47,288 --> 00:01:48,392
Okay, then write smaller.

47
00:01:48,396 --> 00:01:50,852
Be still, please. "Vow"
just became "cow."

48
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:52,413
You don't need vows on your hand.

49
00:01:52,418 --> 00:01:54,102
When you get up there,
just speak from the heart.

50
00:01:54,396 --> 00:01:57,193
Izzie, the heart is an organ.

51
00:01:57,405 --> 00:02:00,630
It pumps, it circulates blood,
it gets clogged from time to time.

52
00:02:00,635 --> 00:02:02,232
It does not, however, speak.

53
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:03,813
It doesn't have tiny little lips on it.

54
00:02:03,926 --> 00:02:05,462
Well, you're all "glass totally empty."

55
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:09,641
I'm gonna like being married.
It's the wedding part that's ridiculous.

56
00:02:12,188 --> 00:02:13,921
- Party's over.
- Damn.

57
00:02:13,947 --> 00:02:17,151
Hey, mine didn't go off. Piece of crap.

58
00:02:19,746 --> 00:02:20,802
You can do this, right ?

59
00:02:20,845 --> 00:02:23,381
Become a piece of chattel ?
Sure. Looking forward to it.

60
00:02:24,138 --> 00:02:27,202
I mean, no matter what, you're
walking down that aisle today.

61
00:02:27,207 --> 00:02:29,533
I need you to go down that aisle.

62
00:02:29,988 --> 00:02:31,810
Is the toilet paper cutting off
your circulation ?

63
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,891
You marrying Burke, it's a sign.

64
00:02:33,956 --> 00:02:36,762
It's a sign that people like
you and me can do this...

65
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:39,172
be healthy, be happy.

66
00:02:39,315 --> 00:02:40,480
You marrying Burke

67
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,530
restores my faith in me.

68
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:46,540
I get it. My wedding's about you.

69
00:02:46,646 --> 00:02:47,833
- Yes.
- Okay.

70
00:02:48,246 --> 00:02:49,412
You can do this, right ?

71
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:50,610
I can do this.

72
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:51,383
Okay.

73
00:02:54,637 --> 00:02:56,111
They found the fourth climber.

74
00:02:56,428 --> 00:02:58,500
Vitals are stabilizing
after fluids, but...

75
00:02:58,505 --> 00:03:00,111
- I thought he was dead.
- He was according to his friends.

76
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,271
Did the C.T. show a bleed ?

77
00:03:01,888 --> 00:03:02,983
We haven't done a C.T. yet.

78
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:04,281
I don't understand. You said
there's a head trauma.

79
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:06,740
There's been a little head trauma.

80
00:03:06,745 --> 00:03:08,413
ice ax to the head.

81
00:03:09,385 --> 00:03:11,343
What the hell happened
up on that mountain ?

82
00:03:11,346 --> 00:03:12,461
That's a good question.

83
00:03:19,045 --> 00:03:21,260
You don't think it could be
uterine cancer, do you ?

84
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:22,991
It runs in the familly.

85
00:03:22,998 --> 00:03:24,071
No, it's not...

86
00:03:25,476 --> 00:03:28,023
she was in earlier. She was
in a fender bender.

87
00:03:29,538 --> 00:03:32,423
My wife came into my hospital,
and you neglected to tell me ?

88
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:34,201
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

89
00:03:34,335 --> 00:03:35,720
We're still married.

90
00:03:35,796 --> 00:03:39,150
She's unconscious. There are medical
decisions to be made.

91
00:03:39,248 --> 00:03:42,631
- Legally I have a right to know.
I have a right...
- She might...

92
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:45,362
be having a miscarriage.

93
00:03:46,907 --> 00:03:47,961
She's pregnant.

94
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,261
I need to know what time
your chest pain started.

95
00:03:55,286 --> 00:03:56,340
I don't know.

96
00:03:56,615 --> 00:03:57,692
Yesterday afternoon.

97
00:03:58,236 --> 00:04:00,653
What time exactly ?
This is important.

98
00:04:01,835 --> 00:04:03,351
Around 3:00.

99
00:04:04,756 --> 00:04:06,492
What's wrong with me ?

100
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:08,700
I'm gonna explain everything
to you. I promise.

101
00:04:08,705 --> 00:04:11,961
But right now we need to get you
up to the surgical floor.

102
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:14,401
Surgery ? But...

103
00:04:14,445 --> 00:04:18,021
- What about my babies ?
- I think those babies are coming out
today.

104
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:21,913
But I-I haven't decided. I...

105
00:04:22,315 --> 00:04:23,973
I haven't chosen the parents.

106
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:26,313
I need time to decide.

107
00:04:27,246 --> 00:04:30,592
You don't need to decide
anything right now.

108
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:33,963
Right now the most important thing
is making sure that you are okay.

109
00:04:34,976 --> 00:04:35,683
All right ?

110
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:40,452
Burke.

111
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:44,872
Ah, I've got a surgery, but it shouldn't
be more than four hours, five tops.

112
00:04:44,878 --> 00:04:45,891
I can scrub in.

113
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:46,592
How's Rina ?

114
00:04:46,595 --> 00:04:50,091
I need to get a C.T. angio, but I'm
pretty sure it's a tear in her aorta.

115
00:04:50,318 --> 00:04:51,371
Her heart is about to blow.

116
00:04:51,376 --> 00:04:54,040
Most dissecting aortas burst
within 48 hours.

117
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:56,750
Which means we have less than 12 hours
to fix it before she's dead.

118
00:04:56,758 --> 00:04:59,082
- So you need me to get the babies out.
- So I can save her life.

119
00:04:59,095 --> 00:05:00,701
You have an aortic dissection ?

120
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:05,550
Hey, I promise I will make it
to the chapel in time.

121
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:06,690
I...

122
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:12,430
Okay. Listen up. Uh, O'Malley,
you're with Shepherd and Sloan.

123
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:15,120
Stevens, you're with Burke.
Karev, Addison. Go.

124
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,990
Grey... you are with the chief's wife.

125
00:05:18,995 --> 00:05:20,671
- The chief's wife ?
- Is pregnant.

126
00:05:20,677 --> 00:05:24,380
Yes, I did say pregnant. I recommend
that you lose the shocked look and try

127
00:05:24,385 --> 00:05:27,341
for something a little more dignified.
Go.

128
00:05:29,237 --> 00:05:30,162
Who am I on ?

129
00:05:30,255 --> 00:05:32,770
Uh, I didn't page you. Go home.
Get some sleep.

130
00:05:33,006 --> 00:05:34,603
Yeah, but I'm here already, so...

131
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:37,121
You're getting married
in less than 12 hours.

132
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:37,963
Give us room.

133
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:41,393
Well, uh, Burke's getting married, too,
and he gets to operate.

134
00:05:41,395 --> 00:05:43,741
There's only one Preston Burke.

135
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,411
There's only one Cristina Yang.

136
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:48,130
I've given you the day off,
the whole day.

137
00:05:48,136 --> 00:05:49,902
It's a kindness. Take it.
It's your wedding day.

138
00:05:49,908 --> 00:05:51,773
- There'll always be more surgeries.
- But...

139
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:53,613
really, what would you rather be doing,

140
00:05:53,616 --> 00:05:56,171
preparing a patient or preparing
for your wedding ? Go home.

141
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:02,402
<i>Saison 3 Episode 25
"Didn't we almost have it all ?"</i>

142
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:06,283
I never got the sense you really
wanted the job.

143
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:10,650
Seems to me you got in the race
to play out some kind of unfinished

144
00:06:10,722 --> 00:06:12,508
business you had with Derek.

145
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:17,624
I was in this to win, sir.

146
00:06:17,796 --> 00:06:19,333
I don't know if he's your new chief,

147
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:22,300
but if he is, he got there because
I made him fight for it.

148
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:24,200
You made them all fight for it.

149
00:06:26,868 --> 00:06:28,460
So I'm not gonna be chief.

150
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:30,191
No you're not.

151
00:06:32,527 --> 00:06:33,871
They recovered Lonnie's body ?

152
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,722
Not his body. He's alive.

153
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:40,823
So why don't you tell me what really
happened up there on the mountain ?

154
00:06:48,488 --> 00:06:51,832
W-we're half way up this ice wall.
There's a...

155
00:06:52,686 --> 00:06:53,731
there's a ledge

156
00:06:53,757 --> 00:06:57,140
a couple of huned feet above us.
We figured we'd set up the tents,

157
00:06:57,398 --> 00:06:58,743
wait out the storm.

158
00:06:59,707 --> 00:07:02,592
Only Lonnie's insisting
we go down the mountain.

159
00:07:03,078 --> 00:07:05,922
I told him, we gotta dig in, sit tight.

160
00:07:06,368 --> 00:07:08,923
He started freaking out, keeps saying
down's the way to go.

161
00:07:09,106 --> 00:07:10,583
And then he starts climbing down.

162
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:12,060
We were tied together.

163
00:07:12,248 --> 00:07:13,781
- And just like that...
- We're falling.

164
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,682
I swing out with my ice ax,

165
00:07:16,828 --> 00:07:18,961
just trying to catch a rock.

166
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:22,910
And I clip Lonnie in the
back of the head.

167
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,601
Ax just...

168
00:07:25,127 --> 00:07:26,220
snags.

169
00:07:28,145 --> 00:07:29,482
We thought he was dead.

170
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:34,613
It was an accident.

171
00:07:40,935 --> 00:07:42,102
What happened ?

172
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:45,030
You've been unconscious for a while.

173
00:07:47,037 --> 00:07:48,901
- What about...
- He knows.

174
00:07:49,097 --> 00:07:50,981
Adele, you lost a lot of blood.

175
00:07:50,986 --> 00:07:52,252
I'm gonna try to find a heartbeat.

176
00:07:53,115 --> 00:07:55,210
You should prepare yourself.

177
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:04,582
Heartbeat.

178
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:08,761
It's a little slower, than I'd like,

179
00:08:08,787 --> 00:08:12,801
but once we tank you with
liquids and a transfusion,

180
00:08:12,936 --> 00:08:14,470
it might get stronger.

181
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:18,401
I've gotta rush off to surgery, but I
will back with you the minute I'm done

182
00:08:18,406 --> 00:08:19,191
- Okay ?
- Thank you.

183
00:08:19,196 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay.

184
00:08:26,096 --> 00:08:27,632
Adele, why didn't you tell me ?

185
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,401
Come on, Richard.

186
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:33,060
What do you think you would've done,

187
00:08:33,677 --> 00:08:35,292
congratulate me ?

188
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:39,993
I'm sure you have work to do.

189
00:08:48,765 --> 00:08:49,801
I'm good right here.

190
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:53,301
The peds resident's on call. He'll be
in the O.R. for Rina's delivery.

191
00:08:53,385 --> 00:08:55,550
Great. Just make sure
they notified the nicu.

192
00:08:56,948 --> 00:08:57,522
Hi.

193
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:01,241
Sorry for interrupting. The nurse
said that you're Dr. M-Montgomery.

194
00:09:01,286 --> 00:09:02,863
Yes. Can I help you with something ?

195
00:09:02,957 --> 00:09:04,092
I'm Jeff Pop

196
00:09:05,447 --> 00:09:06,400
Rebecca's husband ?

197
00:09:32,486 --> 00:09:33,580
Rebecca?

198
00:09:46,777 --> 00:09:47,681
Rebecca ?

199
00:09:49,086 --> 00:09:50,063
Hi, Jeff.

200
00:09:52,847 --> 00:09:53,720
You...

201
00:09:56,007 --> 00:09:57,020
your face...

202
00:10:00,107 --> 00:10:01,022
but it's you.

203
00:10:08,577 --> 00:10:10,113
I'm so sorry, baby.

204
00:10:14,057 --> 00:10:15,743
I should've never let you go.

205
00:10:17,558 --> 00:10:19,021
I'll never let you go again.

206
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:23,043
- Hey.
- I have a surgery.

207
00:10:23,047 --> 00:10:25,353
- I heard you're the best man.
- Yeah.

208
00:10:27,338 --> 00:10:29,802
- Maid of honor, best man, kinda perfect.
- Yeah.

209
00:10:30,075 --> 00:10:32,242
I know I haven't been myself lately, but

210
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:34,783
I'm me again, so I was thinking maybe
you should sleep over, because

211
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:37,142
the me that I am is horny for
the you that you are.

212
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:38,603
I met a woman last night.

213
00:10:40,537 --> 00:10:42,740
- You met a woman last night ?
- At Joe's.

214
00:10:43,188 --> 00:10:44,010
Nothing happened.

215
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:47,252
She was pretty, I noticed,
and we talked.

216
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,692
- You met a woman last night ?
- Yeah.

217
00:10:50,146 --> 00:10:51,553
- So should I be worried or something ?

218
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:53,240
Should you be worried
that I met a woman ?

219
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:54,011
No.

220
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,960
Should you be worried that,

221
00:10:56,485 --> 00:10:59,773
for me, flirting with that woman
was the highlight of my week ?

222
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:02,032
Yeah, you should be worried
or something.

223
00:11:05,426 --> 00:11:06,563
I don't understand.

224
00:11:07,295 --> 00:11:08,201
It's not you.

225
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:11,303
No, I understand that part. What
I don't understand is why.

226
00:11:11,607 --> 00:11:12,682
I need this job,

227
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,101
Richard. I need it more than the others.

228
00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:16,013
- Addison...
- No, I need a reason

229
00:11:16,015 --> 00:11:17,170
to stay here.

230
00:11:17,346 --> 00:11:19,632
I need a reason to get up in
the morning. I need to wake up

231
00:11:19,697 --> 00:11:22,920
and not care that it's raining
or that I'm 39 and alone.

232
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:25,253
I need the job, Richard.

233
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:26,871
That's why.

234
00:11:28,148 --> 00:11:30,283
If you need a job to give you a life,

235
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,323
you either need a new job

236
00:11:32,598 --> 00:11:33,672
or a new life.

237
00:11:42,456 --> 00:11:46,130
I'm thinking four hours tops
to repair this heart,

238
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,593
if all goes well.

239
00:11:48,058 --> 00:11:49,301
You're a lucky man, Burke.

240
00:11:50,197 --> 00:11:51,172
Cristina's great.

241
00:11:51,255 --> 00:11:52,951
She's there, she's sure.

242
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:54,653
She's willing to commit.

243
00:11:55,697 --> 00:11:56,671
You're a lucky man.

244
00:11:58,068 --> 00:11:58,943
And you're not ?

245
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,611
There he is.

246
00:12:02,718 --> 00:12:04,361
T-minus five hours.

247
00:12:04,368 --> 00:12:06,771
And how's the best man ?
Up to the challenge ?

248
00:12:06,775 --> 00:12:08,922
I was an excellent best man.

249
00:12:09,158 --> 00:12:12,241
You know, the worst case scenario
is I sleep with your wife in ten years.

250
00:12:14,297 --> 00:12:15,201
Okay.

251
00:12:20,088 --> 00:12:22,033
I just checked. Chief resident
hasn't been posted yet.

252
00:12:22,268 --> 00:12:23,091
No, no. I wasn't looking

253
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:24,303
- for chief resident.
- Yeah, you were.

254
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:26,420
Yeah. Okay, I was.

255
00:12:32,617 --> 00:12:33,443
George...

256
00:12:33,557 --> 00:12:36,042
- Hey.
- What I'm about to say is, is crazy.

257
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:38,661
And, I-I-I am not responsible.

258
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:41,710
I-I am saying this against my will.
Because I am a surgeon,

259
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:44,762
okay ? I-I-I love my job. I love
my life exactly as it is.

260
00:12:44,768 --> 00:12:46,783
Okay ? Exactly as it is. Do you
understand what I'm saying ?

261
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:47,691
Not really

262
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:51,421
I-I have no desire to house a human
being in my body for 9 long months

263
00:12:51,427 --> 00:12:54,690
and then...and then...and then push it
out and raise it. Okay ? None.

264
00:12:54,755 --> 00:12:55,353
Zero.

265
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:57,730
- Okay.
- Except housing a human

266
00:12:57,965 --> 00:13:00,312
for nine long months is all
that I can think about.

267
00:13:00,317 --> 00:13:05,361
It... it... the thoughts are invading the
surgeries that I love, and it's... it's...

268
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:08,991
it's... it's hormonal.
It's... and horrible.

269
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,511
But it is happening...

270
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:13,373
to me.

271
00:13:14,536 --> 00:13:16,982
You want to have a baby ?

272
00:13:17,966 --> 00:13:19,092
Apparently.

273
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:22,132
There's a guy with an ax in his head.

274
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,191
- Right.
- So go.

275
00:13:24,195 --> 00:13:27,040
I'm a freak. Just go. Just run. Just...

276
00:13:27,055 --> 00:13:29,030
- thank you.
- Please.

277
00:13:29,665 --> 00:13:31,243
Go. I'm fine.

278
00:13:33,098 --> 00:13:35,333
Take your pill... and drink your water.

279
00:13:35,677 --> 00:13:38,490
Richard, you know you wanna go out
that door and start bossing some

280
00:13:38,497 --> 00:13:41,370
- people around.
- Take your pillule Adele.

281
00:13:44,996 --> 00:13:45,992
See ?

282
00:13:46,975 --> 00:13:49,883
I can do my bossing
right from this chair.

283
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:57,721
Go ahead, Richard, ask.

284
00:13:58,527 --> 00:14:02,451
- I know you are dying to know whose
baby th...
- not really my place.

285
00:14:04,185 --> 00:14:05,340
Mrs. Webber...

286
00:14:05,388 --> 00:14:07,183
your room is ready.

287
00:14:07,185 --> 00:14:08,680
Excuse me, but

288
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:12,051
what do you want to do about the
announcement for chief of surgery ?

289
00:14:14,498 --> 00:14:16,170
Look, I will be right back.

290
00:14:17,186 --> 00:14:18,662
I promise.

291
00:14:23,006 --> 00:14:24,773
We've met before.

292
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:27,272
You probably don't remember.

293
00:14:27,377 --> 00:14:28,411
You were little.

294
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:34,193
My husband always flirted
with your mother.

295
00:14:36,597 --> 00:14:39,481
I didn't want to see that, so...

296
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:41,890
I watched you a lot,

297
00:14:42,235 --> 00:14:43,793
watched you grow up.

298
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:45,390
You turned out well.

299
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,941
I'm sorry about your mother.

300
00:14:48,568 --> 00:14:49,521
I'm...

301
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:52,183
sorry about my mother, too.

302
00:14:53,596 --> 00:14:55,133
It wasn't your fault.

303
00:14:55,246 --> 00:14:57,491
Maybe it wasn't anyone's fault.

304
00:14:57,868 --> 00:15:03,191
You get married at 25 thinking,
this is it, happily ever after.

305
00:15:03,547 --> 00:15:06,232
Maybe there is no happily ever after.

306
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:10,910
It's stunning.

307
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:12,740
It's a little...

308
00:15:13,105 --> 00:15:14,621
Is it supposed to be so tight ?

309
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:16,723
Well, it's a choker.

310
00:15:17,807 --> 00:15:18,922
It's beautiful.

311
00:15:19,446 --> 00:15:22,503
It's really, really beautiful.

312
00:15:23,476 --> 00:15:25,341
I just don't know if it's me.

313
00:15:26,506 --> 00:15:30,290
Five generations of Burke women have
worn this on their wedding day.

314
00:15:30,626 --> 00:15:32,141
It's a way of...

315
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,051
joining our family,

316
00:15:34,056 --> 00:15:35,842
becoming a Burke.

317
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:36,973
A Burke.

318
00:15:38,617 --> 00:15:42,771
I'm afraid I missjudged you early on.
I thought you were selfish.

319
00:15:42,895 --> 00:15:46,241
But you've given way to Preston's
ideas about the wedding,

320
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:49,361
and you've been flexible
about the things that are...

321
00:15:50,776 --> 00:15:52,602
most important to him.

322
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:54,892
And that is wonderful.

323
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:57,542
It's just...

324
00:15:58,836 --> 00:16:01,492
what were you planning to do
about your eyebrows ?

325
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,901
N-nothing.

326
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:10,012
How's she doing ?

327
00:16:10,415 --> 00:16:12,880
B.P.'s 92 over 56.

328
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,421
How'd the reunion go with
Jane Doe's husband ?

329
00:16:15,427 --> 00:16:18,693
Whatever. He cried like a baby.
She looked bored.

330
00:16:18,696 --> 00:16:20,831
Don't go overboard with
compassion, Karev.

331
00:16:20,838 --> 00:16:23,013
She's not even sure if she wants
to stay with the guy.

332
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,011
- It's complicated
- It's not actually...

333
00:16:25,015 --> 00:16:26,050
complicated.

334
00:16:26,657 --> 00:16:28,442
- They're married.
- She took a vow.

335
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:30,311
You don't mess with vows.
Married is married.

336
00:16:30,608 --> 00:16:33,390
Game over. So freakin'over.

337
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:36,872
Just an opinion.

338
00:16:37,345 --> 00:16:38,652
Pressure's dropped to 60.

339
00:16:38,656 --> 00:16:40,343
She's bleeding out. Addison,
how much longer ?

340
00:16:40,348 --> 00:16:41,462
Rupturing the membrane now.

341
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,683
- I just need 2 minutes
to get these babies out.
- Make it one.

342
00:16:43,696 --> 00:16:46,183
She's flatlined. Stevens,
start compressions.

343
00:16:46,516 --> 00:16:48,033
Got the first one out. Clamp.

344
00:16:48,037 --> 00:16:49,212
Come on come on.

345
00:16:50,215 --> 00:16:52,662
- Second baby's out. Okay, go.
- Boki, 10-blade.

346
00:16:58,906 --> 00:17:01,381
Poor guy... he just wanted to climb
a mountain, and he ends up with an

347
00:17:01,397 --> 00:17:02,771
ax in his head.

348
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:04,431
Well, he shouldn't have tried
turning back.

349
00:17:04,438 --> 00:17:06,640
The group is going up,
you move with the group.

350
00:17:06,645 --> 00:17:08,221
- Okay, drill, please.
- He panicked.

351
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,360
You have a right to turn back
if you're scared.

352
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:11,220
No, you don't.

353
00:17:11,225 --> 00:17:12,171
You chose to climb a mountain.

354
00:17:12,176 --> 00:17:14,250
You can't change your mind
in the middle of the climb.

355
00:17:19,896 --> 00:17:22,053
- Okay.
- Now we pull it out ?

356
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:26,262
Ah, yeah, but the ax went in as they
fell, so there will be some tearing,

357
00:17:26,386 --> 00:17:28,040
it should be a shallow wound,

358
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:30,543
- and it should come out easily.
- You got it ?

359
00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:34,912
All right, everybody. Here we go. Ready?

360
00:17:35,058 --> 00:17:39,150
Okay, one, two... three.

361
00:17:44,656 --> 00:17:46,063
That's strange.

362
00:17:46,908 --> 00:17:52,873
One... two. Three !

363
00:17:57,887 --> 00:18:00,683
- That's a clean cut.
- I thought you said there was gonna
be tearing.

364
00:18:00,837 --> 00:18:02,833
I know. It doesn't make sense.

365
00:18:04,788 --> 00:18:06,493
You are a lucky guy.

366
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,322
Yeah.

367
00:18:08,077 --> 00:18:10,153
Or the ax didn't go in there
by accident.

368
00:18:14,205 --> 00:18:15,651
It's probably unfair,

369
00:18:16,087 --> 00:18:18,221
but I hold you to a higher standard.

370
00:18:19,605 --> 00:18:21,470
And you let me down this year, Preston.

371
00:18:21,705 --> 00:18:22,920
After you got shot,

372
00:18:23,587 --> 00:18:24,613
the tremor...

373
00:18:25,975 --> 00:18:29,042
this job is about making
the tough calls.

374
00:18:30,118 --> 00:18:31,830
Sometimes the toughest call
you can make

375
00:18:31,848 --> 00:18:33,540
is admitting when you're
in over your head.

376
00:18:34,425 --> 00:18:35,661
You don't do that.

377
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:38,541
You know a lot, Preston.

378
00:18:39,866 --> 00:18:42,153
You're one of the best surgeons
I know...

379
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,333
one of the best men.

380
00:18:46,216 --> 00:18:47,761
But you're not perfect.

381
00:18:49,267 --> 00:18:51,672
You don't know everything.

382
00:18:56,585 --> 00:18:58,331
I want to give you the job.

383
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:01,973
I want to.

384
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:05,812
But I can't.

385
00:19:11,938 --> 00:19:12,963
Preston.

386
00:19:14,098 --> 00:19:15,382
I have a wedding to get to.

387
00:19:19,857 --> 00:19:20,911
Thank you.

388
00:19:20,918 --> 00:19:22,721
Yeah. The babies are doing great.

389
00:19:22,748 --> 00:19:23,950
They're in the nicu.

390
00:19:24,025 --> 00:19:25,543
How are you doing up there, Preston ?

391
00:19:25,728 --> 00:19:28,901
- Close call, but she's stabilized.
- Good work, Dr. Burke.

392
00:19:28,938 --> 00:19:32,751
We may actually get you to the church
on time. You nervous ?

393
00:19:33,116 --> 00:19:34,502
No, not really.

394
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:37,151
More, uh... excited.

395
00:19:39,277 --> 00:19:42,442
Except by my vows. I wrote them myself,

396
00:19:42,588 --> 00:19:44,772
and... I don't know.

397
00:19:44,897 --> 00:19:46,681
They may be too...

398
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:49,682
- I want'em to be right.
- Well, let's hear'em.

399
00:19:50,896 --> 00:19:51,431
What, now ?

400
00:19:51,497 --> 00:19:54,170
Hey, you've got a room full
of women. Try it out on us.

401
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:05,450
Cristina...

402
00:20:07,096 --> 00:20:08,423
I could promise...

403
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:12,550
to hold you...

404
00:20:13,866 --> 00:20:15,342
and to cherish you.

405
00:20:15,488 --> 00:20:16,921
I could promise

406
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,461
to be there in sickness and in health.

407
00:20:20,626 --> 00:20:21,791
I could say...

408
00:20:23,106 --> 00:20:25,122
till death do us part.

409
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,143
But I won't.

410
00:20:28,516 --> 00:20:29,861
Those vows

411
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:31,741
are for...

412
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:33,930
optimistic couples,

413
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,592
the ones full of hope.

414
00:20:35,997 --> 00:20:37,361
And I do not stand here

415
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:38,793
on my wedding day

416
00:20:39,256 --> 00:20:40,852
opmistic

417
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:42,520
or full of hope.

418
00:20:42,837 --> 00:20:44,181
Okay, um...

419
00:20:45,705 --> 00:20:48,013
I am not optimistic.

420
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:50,112
I am not hopeful.

421
00:20:50,997 --> 00:20:52,303
I am sure.

422
00:20:54,388 --> 00:20:55,562
I am steady.

423
00:20:57,127 --> 00:20:58,182
And I know.

424
00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:02,223
I am a heart man.

425
00:21:04,445 --> 00:21:05,841
I take'em apart.

426
00:21:06,738 --> 00:21:08,173
I put 'em back together.

427
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:11,292
I hold them in my hands.

428
00:21:12,777 --> 00:21:14,803
I am a heart man.

429
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:19,422
So of this I am sure...

430
00:21:20,928 --> 00:21:22,692
you are my partner...

431
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:25,651
my lover...

432
00:21:26,508 --> 00:21:28,200
my very best friend.

433
00:21:29,648 --> 00:21:32,453
My heart... my heart... beats for you.

434
00:21:32,788 --> 00:21:34,730
And on this day,

435
00:21:35,148 --> 00:21:37,050
the day of our wedding,

436
00:21:37,177 --> 00:21:39,252
I promise you this...

437
00:21:40,025 --> 00:21:41,753
I promise you

438
00:21:42,048 --> 00:21:44,831
to lay my heart in the palm
of your hands.

439
00:21:48,018 --> 00:21:49,171
I promise you...

440
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:50,193
me.

441
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:00,112
Too trite ? 

442
00:22:00,246 --> 00:22:02,150
- Because I can rewrite it...
- No.

443
00:22:03,235 --> 00:22:04,710
No. It's...

444
00:22:05,828 --> 00:22:07,693
I think I speak for...

445
00:22:09,505 --> 00:22:11,602
every woman in this room

446
00:22:11,606 --> 00:22:13,580
when I say dump her.

447
00:22:13,586 --> 00:22:15,123
Dump Yang and marry me.

448
00:22:25,097 --> 00:22:25,820
Hey.

449
00:22:27,648 --> 00:22:28,330
Hey.

450
00:22:28,688 --> 00:22:31,881
- Hey. Oh, god. Did I miss a page ?
- No, no, no, no, no.

451
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:33,503
Everything's okay.

452
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:37,503
What ?

453
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:39,683
Is this really what you want ?

454
00:22:41,975 --> 00:22:44,451
'cause if it's really what you want,
we could do it.

455
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:50,502
- Really ?
- Yeah.

456
00:22:53,566 --> 00:22:55,800
- Okay, wait. Really ?
- Really.

457
00:22:56,266 --> 00:22:58,053
Oh, my god.

458
00:22:58,056 --> 00:22:59,412
Oh, my god. Really ?

459
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:12,361
She looks like Rebecca.

460
00:23:13,028 --> 00:23:15,233
Well, at least what Rebecca
used to look like.

461
00:23:16,748 --> 00:23:17,851
But still.

462
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:20,720
Around the eyes.

463
00:23:20,918 --> 00:23:21,581
Yeah.

464
00:23:22,245 --> 00:23:23,890
I thought I'd give her some space.

465
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:25,882
She seemed a little overwhelmed.

466
00:23:32,758 --> 00:23:35,260
The ferry crash was on the news
everywhere.

467
00:23:35,795 --> 00:23:37,372
Your wife goes missing...

468
00:23:37,538 --> 00:23:39,093
how could you not look for her ?

469
00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:43,052
I thought she left me.

470
00:23:46,047 --> 00:23:47,733
We got into a fight that night.

471
00:23:47,915 --> 00:23:50,413
She was trying to tell me how
unhappy she was and...

472
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:51,993
I shut her down.

473
00:23:54,626 --> 00:23:58,672
Yeah, I didn't look for her when she
was missing, but what's worse is...

474
00:23:59,616 --> 00:24:01,503
I didn't see her when she was there.

475
00:24:03,086 --> 00:24:06,061
I can't imagine what it must have
been like for her,

476
00:24:06,337 --> 00:24:09,103
what her face must have
looked like all broken.

477
00:24:09,146 --> 00:24:10,613
She was beautiful.

478
00:24:20,165 --> 00:24:21,430
I love her.

479
00:24:22,326 --> 00:24:23,302
You know ?

480
00:24:40,456 --> 00:24:41,452
Meredith.

481
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:44,822
You are not gonna believe...

482
00:24:44,945 --> 00:24:47,192
Derek met a girl...

483
00:24:47,325 --> 00:24:48,291
in a bar.

484
00:24:48,718 --> 00:24:50,253
And he flirted with her.

485
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:51,233
And he told me.

486
00:24:51,317 --> 00:24:53,491
You know, no big deal.
Just thought I should know.

487
00:24:53,496 --> 00:24:54,202
Meredith.

488
00:24:54,258 --> 00:24:55,643
I'm not exaggerating.

489
00:24:55,648 --> 00:24:57,893
He didn't even hint. He just
flat out told me.

490
00:24:57,908 --> 00:25:01,132
Meredith, you know how sometimes it's
about you, and sometimes it's about me ?

491
00:25:01,136 --> 00:25:04,892
This is really, really about me.

492
00:25:06,787 --> 00:25:08,630
Mama took my eyebrows.

493
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:12,403
She took my eyebrows,
and now I am a Burke.

494
00:25:17,665 --> 00:25:18,802
Lonnie's stable...

495
00:25:20,138 --> 00:25:22,882
but the damage he sustained
is significant.

496
00:25:23,368 --> 00:25:24,730
But is he gonna wake up ?

497
00:25:25,677 --> 00:25:26,813
Do you want him to?

498
00:25:26,886 --> 00:25:27,752
What ?

499
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:30,893
The ax in his head was put
there deliberately.

500
00:25:31,385 --> 00:25:34,891
I just wanted to give you three guys
another opportunity to tell me the truth.

501
00:25:40,345 --> 00:25:41,593
- It wasn't...
- Shut up, Andy.

502
00:25:41,595 --> 00:25:44,551
- But we can't just sit here...
- I said shut up, Andy.

503
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:47,540
Is that how you let him talk to you
at 14,000 feet ?

504
00:25:48,318 --> 00:25:51,582
I have to talk to his family.
You guys can talk to the cops.

505
00:26:00,948 --> 00:26:01,862
Dr. Bailey.

506
00:26:02,556 --> 00:26:03,453
Yeah. What ?

507
00:26:04,476 --> 00:26:06,872
Cristina needs to cut something.

508
00:26:07,828 --> 00:26:10,760
I can't really explain it
in a way that won't make you glare.

509
00:26:11,608 --> 00:26:11,901
But...

510
00:26:12,577 --> 00:26:13,610
they took her eyebrows

511
00:26:13,977 --> 00:26:15,032
and they called her a Burke.

512
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,353
She really needs
to cut somebody open.

513
00:26:17,857 --> 00:26:18,641
Yang...

514
00:26:20,138 --> 00:26:23,381
go... do...
getting married things.

515
00:26:24,227 --> 00:26:25,541
Get out of this hospital.

516
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:30,391
I mean...

517
00:26:32,446 --> 00:26:33,810
I...

518
00:26:34,788 --> 00:26:36,481
you have to let me cut,

519
00:26:36,938 --> 00:26:40,720
because I am standing here
eyebrowless with no dignity left.

520
00:26:40,745 --> 00:26:42,681
I am a surgeon, dr. Bailey.

521
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:45,143
But right now I don't feel like one.
I feel...

522
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:47,372
like...

523
00:26:48,865 --> 00:26:50,453
somebody else.

524
00:26:51,436 --> 00:26:52,570
Do you know what that's like,

525
00:26:53,786 --> 00:26:55,422
not to feel like yourself ?

526
00:27:04,937 --> 00:27:05,482
What's going on?

527
00:27:05,547 --> 00:27:07,833
She started cramping and then
she got really diaphoretic.

528
00:27:08,638 --> 00:27:12,832
Alert O.B. to a possible D & C due to
an incomplete miscarriage.

529
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:14,063
Adele,

530
00:27:14,228 --> 00:27:16,801
you could have a placental abruption
due to the trauma.

531
00:27:16,985 --> 00:27:18,693
We've got to get you
to into an O.R. now.

532
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:20,152
Let's move, people !

533
00:27:27,097 --> 00:27:29,883
Sir, dr. Shepherd is here.

534
00:27:31,987 --> 00:27:33,113
Thank you.

535
00:27:36,097 --> 00:27:37,453
Richard, are you sure
you want to...

536
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:40,442
you don't have to do this today.

537
00:27:44,148 --> 00:27:45,042
Yes, I do.

538
00:27:51,475 --> 00:27:53,163
She went into early D.I.C.

539
00:27:53,608 --> 00:27:56,271
I gave her blood, platelets, F. F. P,

540
00:27:57,297 --> 00:28:00,932
pregnancy at 52 is dangerous.
I tried everything. I

541
00:28:01,286 --> 00:28:02,222
couldn't save...

542
00:28:21,797 --> 00:28:22,891
I thought...

543
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:25,432
I thought...

544
00:28:26,528 --> 00:28:28,432
for a second, I thought I'd lost you.

545
00:28:34,457 --> 00:28:38,063
Do you want to... call somebody ?
I can...

546
00:28:38,376 --> 00:28:39,570
No, no one.

547
00:28:40,275 --> 00:28:42,702
Well, the father of the baby,
maybe you want to...

548
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:45,732
He doesn't even know about it.
I didn't tell him.

549
00:28:46,515 --> 00:28:47,421
I, um...

550
00:28:47,837 --> 00:28:49,531
I think I misjudged him.

551
00:28:51,228 --> 00:28:53,572
I thought he'd go running
for the hills.

552
00:28:54,238 --> 00:28:55,712
But actually...

553
00:28:57,367 --> 00:28:59,751
He's a much better man
than I thought.

554
00:29:01,137 --> 00:29:04,550
He'll get over his initial judgments,
and he'll...

555
00:29:04,955 --> 00:29:06,293
sit with you...

556
00:29:08,388 --> 00:29:10,723
and he'll make you drink
your water.

557
00:29:17,576 --> 00:29:18,090
Look

558
00:29:19,338 --> 00:29:22,680
- Adele...
- It was a boy.

559
00:29:25,077 --> 00:29:26,362
I'm sorry.

560
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,783
All right, dr. Leonard, would you please
close for dr. Burke ?

561
00:29:37,907 --> 00:29:38,972
He has a wedding to get to.

562
00:29:39,608 --> 00:29:40,613
One cut,

563
00:29:40,808 --> 00:29:42,143
and then you're gone.

564
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:42,632
One.

565
00:29:43,287 --> 00:29:44,653
But... I still have to...

566
00:29:44,828 --> 00:29:46,761
Come on. You want your bride
waiting for you at the altar ?

567
00:29:46,896 --> 00:29:48,163
They don't like that.
Let's go.

568
00:29:49,877 --> 00:29:51,200
We gotta go now, Cristina.

569
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:53,953
Grey.

570
00:29:54,118 --> 00:29:55,593
Put the scalpel down, Cristina.

571
00:30:02,977 --> 00:30:04,493
You can still do this, right ?

572
00:30:11,298 --> 00:30:11,763
What?

573
00:30:12,776 --> 00:30:13,503
Hold on a minute.

574
00:30:20,405 --> 00:30:23,351
I just wanted to make sure
no one's around so I can say this.

575
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,072
- I think we've said everything
we need to say.
- Shut up.

576
00:30:26,796 --> 00:30:27,771
I am an optimist.

577
00:30:29,656 --> 00:30:30,900
I am hopeful.

578
00:30:32,215 --> 00:30:32,900
I am not sure.

579
00:30:32,936 --> 00:30:34,753
- Look, I can do this myself.
- Let me speak.

580
00:30:38,987 --> 00:30:42,293
Because I'm your best friend
and because I love you,

581
00:30:43,178 --> 00:30:45,743
if what you want is to be with Callie,

582
00:30:46,498 --> 00:30:49,121
then I will do everything
in my power to support you

583
00:30:50,245 --> 00:30:52,512
and help you
make your marriage work.

584
00:30:54,747 --> 00:30:56,843
But because
I'm your best friend

585
00:30:58,097 --> 00:31:00,202
and because I love you...

586
00:31:02,188 --> 00:31:03,131
I also

587
00:31:03,556 --> 00:31:04,770
have to say...

588
00:31:07,387 --> 00:31:09,783
that I'm in love with you.

589
00:31:13,098 --> 00:31:14,931
I'm in love with you.

590
00:31:16,715 --> 00:31:21,512
I can't promise the future,
I can't promise perfection because

591
00:31:21,758 --> 00:31:25,192
we're us and I'm me
and who knows what will happen.

592
00:31:27,528 --> 00:31:28,761
But in my heart...

593
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,541
I am sure.

594
00:31:34,315 --> 00:31:35,930
I'm in love with you, George.

595
00:31:36,526 --> 00:31:38,533
And I hope you're in love with me, too.

596
00:31:45,675 --> 00:31:46,370
Say something.

597
00:31:47,967 --> 00:31:48,701
What time is it ?

598
00:31:48,986 --> 00:31:49,730
You got 30 minutes.

599
00:31:49,788 --> 00:31:51,502
Oh, crap. I'm gonna be late
for my own wedding.

600
00:31:51,617 --> 00:31:52,711
No, we're not.

601
00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:57,162
Dr. Burke asked me
to check on you.

602
00:31:58,555 --> 00:32:04,012
Let's see. Your, post-op x-rays look
good. We'll discuss releasing you.

603
00:32:04,145 --> 00:32:05,653
- Any change in Lonnie ?
- Andy ?

604
00:32:05,827 --> 00:32:06,263
Who are you?

605
00:32:07,465 --> 00:32:08,511
He's my lawyer.

606
00:32:10,127 --> 00:32:12,332
- That was fast.
- Don't you dare judge me.

607
00:32:13,825 --> 00:32:14,823
You weren't there.

608
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:20,032
We thought... he was almost dead.
No way he was gonna make it.

609
00:32:20,737 --> 00:32:22,890
He was in so much pain.

610
00:32:25,687 --> 00:32:26,583
So I...

611
00:32:28,467 --> 00:32:31,040
- picked it up...
- Andy, shut up.
- No !

612
00:32:32,108 --> 00:32:34,382
I'm not gonna shut up.

613
00:32:37,108 --> 00:32:38,792
I put him out of his misery.

614
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:45,123
And if I was back there right now...

615
00:32:46,788 --> 00:32:47,692
I'd do the same thing.

616
00:32:49,866 --> 00:32:50,733
He was my friend.

617
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:53,833
He is my friend.

618
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,002
I put him out of his misery.

619
00:33:03,498 --> 00:33:04,443
Anyone got any deodorant ?

620
00:33:04,547 --> 00:33:06,600
You're not putting my deodorant
in your hairy armpits.

621
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:07,021
Don't move.

622
00:33:07,145 --> 00:33:09,791
You're gonna have a unibrow.
And I have some in my locker.

623
00:33:10,026 --> 00:33:11,840
Uh, closed ? Open ?

624
00:33:12,137 --> 00:33:12,863
Closed.

625
00:33:14,477 --> 00:33:14,912
Perfect.

626
00:33:15,115 --> 00:33:15,671
Dashing.

627
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:17,000
- Thanks.
- You look great.

628
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,062
- Moment of truth, people.
- Those our scores ?

629
00:33:20,347 --> 00:33:20,670
Grey.

630
00:33:21,556 --> 00:33:22,032
Karev.

631
00:33:22,527 --> 00:33:23,913
Yang, Stevens

632
00:33:24,396 --> 00:33:25,052
whoo-hoo !

633
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:25,640
O'Malley.

634
00:33:25,865 --> 00:33:26,411
Yes !

635
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:27,560
right here, baby.

636
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:29,413
Yes. Thank god.

637
00:33:31,146 --> 00:33:32,142
Did you pass ?

638
00:33:32,228 --> 00:33:34,203
You bet your married booty, I did.

639
00:33:35,867 --> 00:33:37,010
How'd you do ? Did you pass ?

640
00:33:37,656 --> 00:33:38,262
Yeah.

641
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:41,523
- I'll talk to you at the church.
- Okay

642
00:33:44,078 --> 00:33:46,643
- All right. Let's go.
- Excuse me.

643
00:33:48,108 --> 00:33:48,851
Meredith.

644
00:33:49,368 --> 00:33:50,422
I'll meet you at the chapel.

645
00:33:50,876 --> 00:33:52,081
Iz, will you take the dress ?

646
00:33:52,766 --> 00:33:53,753
- I'll be right there.
- Okay.

647
00:34:01,696 --> 00:34:02,671
I like the suit.

648
00:34:02,788 --> 00:34:05,691
- The suit is way better than the scrubs.
- Thanks.

649
00:34:06,007 --> 00:34:08,142
Hey, uh, I passed
my intern exam.

650
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:10,730
- Good ! That's good.
- Yeah.

651
00:34:15,276 --> 00:34:17,213
We got discharged,
me and the baby.

652
00:34:19,628 --> 00:34:22,353
Oh, come on, you just
you just had brain surgery.

653
00:34:22,376 --> 00:34:23,830
You're still...
you're still on antibiotics.

654
00:34:23,865 --> 00:34:25,972
My body's been signed off on by...

655
00:34:27,235 --> 00:34:29,812
plastics, cardio, orthopedics,
neuro and O.B.,

656
00:34:29,988 --> 00:34:31,463
And my... and also, my teeth

657
00:34:31,877 --> 00:34:32,813
got the blessing from...

658
00:34:33,348 --> 00:34:35,273
wait, I can say this...
prosthodontics.

659
00:34:35,346 --> 00:34:36,492
Yeah, but there's still your memory

660
00:34:36,526 --> 00:34:39,192
you know how I know my memory's fine ?
Because I can say prosthodontics.

661
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:42,621
- Yeah, but the baby...
- Discharged, by peds.

662
00:34:43,295 --> 00:34:44,133
Yeah, but...

663
00:34:50,977 --> 00:34:52,201
I have every reason to go.

664
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:57,092
And and yeah, I'm scared.
And yeah, this is moving at warp speed.

665
00:34:57,358 --> 00:34:59,602
And yeah, I'm freaking out,
but Jeff is good.

666
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:03,052
And Jeff isthe father of my child.
The man is out buying a car seat

667
00:35:03,345 --> 00:35:04,002
right now.

668
00:35:04,778 --> 00:35:06,142
And the minute he gets back...

669
00:35:09,046 --> 00:35:10,621
I have every reason to go,

670
00:35:11,305 --> 00:35:12,462
because medically...

671
00:35:13,725 --> 00:35:15,573
there's no need for me to stay.

672
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:18,262
Medically.

673
00:35:22,598 --> 00:35:24,373
Okay. Well, then
I'll just check the chart.

674
00:35:25,615 --> 00:35:27,032
- Damn it.
- We got, uh...

675
00:35:27,957 --> 00:35:28,440
what ?

676
00:35:28,787 --> 00:35:33,062
Are you... Do I have to spell
everything out for you ? I mean,

677
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:37,502
Did you sniff too much glue as a child ?
I'm asking you something here

678
00:35:39,248 --> 00:35:40,580
What do you want from me?

679
00:35:41,437 --> 00:35:42,773
I want...

680
00:35:44,507 --> 00:35:46,781
I want you to give me
a reason to stay...

681
00:35:48,925 --> 00:35:50,211
a real reason.

682
00:35:51,557 --> 00:35:55,610
I mean, Jeff's... Jeff's a decent guy,
a good, decent guy.

683
00:35:56,475 --> 00:36:02,070
But to him, I'm Rebecca, and I don't
know if I am rebecca anymore and...

684
00:36:03,548 --> 00:36:07,073
you know me. You knew... you knew
when I couldn't even speak who I was.

685
00:36:09,457 --> 00:36:12,172
You... you named me Ava,
and I was more me

686
00:36:12,736 --> 00:36:15,552
as Ava then I'll ever be as rebecca.

687
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:19,790
Look, I have every reason
to go back to my life.

688
00:36:21,707 --> 00:36:22,683
And I will.

689
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:26,653
Unless... you...

690
00:36:30,075 --> 00:36:36,472
Alex, I'm asking you to give me a
reason to stay here... A reason from you

691
00:36:39,058 --> 00:36:40,870
Jeff loves you. He's a...

692
00:36:41,648 --> 00:36:44,442
- He's a decent guy.
- Alex, give me a reason.

693
00:36:58,596 --> 00:37:02,183
I think you should stay
with the decent guy.

694
00:37:12,077 --> 00:37:15,811
If you want to break up with me
so you can see other women, just do it.

695
00:37:16,127 --> 00:37:19,633
Don't tell me you met another woman.
Just end it if that's what you want.

696
00:37:19,955 --> 00:37:21,642
I can't.
Sure you can.

697
00:37:21,876 --> 00:37:23,213
Here's how it goes...

698
00:37:23,925 --> 00:37:26,333
meredith, I don't want
to see you anymore.

699
00:37:26,498 --> 00:37:28,630
Meredith, I don't love you anymore.

700
00:37:28,698 --> 00:37:29,223
Meredith...

701
00:37:32,305 --> 00:37:35,822
I do love you.
Don't you see ?

702
00:37:37,325 --> 00:37:39,092
Don't you understand?

703
00:37:40,595 --> 00:37:44,672
You're the love of my life.
I can't leave you.

704
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:48,532
But you're constantly leaving me.

705
00:37:49,598 --> 00:37:52,103
You walk away when you want,
you come back when you want.

706
00:37:52,776 --> 00:37:53,941
Not everyone,

707
00:37:54,885 --> 00:37:57,563
not your friends,
but you leave me.

708
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:06,130
So I'm asking you... If you don't see a
future for us, if you aren't in this...

709
00:38:08,438 --> 00:38:13,740
please... please just end it,
because I can't. I'm in it.

710
00:38:16,195 --> 00:38:18,642
Put me out of my misery

711
00:38:23,285 --> 00:38:27,552
I... I can't. I... I...
Cristina is getting married.

712
00:38:28,185 --> 00:38:30,233
I have to go
make sure she gets married.

713
00:38:31,145 --> 00:38:35,252
- Meredith...
- I really need to make sure
she gets down that aisle.

714
00:38:37,126 --> 00:38:40,382
Let's go. We're running late.

715
00:38:54,336 --> 00:38:55,442
You okay ?

716
00:38:55,786 --> 00:38:57,953
I'm fine. I'm fine.

717
00:38:59,688 --> 00:39:03,472
You need anything ? Need a mint, huh ?
A getaway car ?

718
00:39:04,645 --> 00:39:07,660
If it's the chief thing, don't worry
about it. You deserve it.

719
00:39:07,917 --> 00:39:09,583
Richard didn't pick me
to be chief.

720
00:39:11,667 --> 00:39:13,120
We all assumed you...

721
00:39:14,517 --> 00:39:16,881
- Well, who did he pick ?
- I don't know. It wasn't me.

722
00:39:19,745 --> 00:39:23,290
You really don't...
look so good.

723
00:39:23,998 --> 00:39:26,011
Meredith and I
may not make it.

724
00:39:27,328 --> 00:39:29,783
I think I want it
more than she does.

725
00:39:30,316 --> 00:39:31,162
It's all about you today.

726
00:39:33,345 --> 00:39:36,292
- You really are a good best man.
- I try.

727
00:39:38,117 --> 00:39:39,011
Cristina.

728
00:39:43,988 --> 00:39:46,830
- Cristina ?
- I didn't run.

729
00:39:50,078 --> 00:39:51,211
You look beautiful.

730
00:39:52,928 --> 00:39:56,170
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you.

731
00:39:56,465 --> 00:39:58,663
Frankly, I always feared

732
00:39:59,175 --> 00:40:03,372
you were too emotionally
stunted to settle down.

733
00:40:05,616 --> 00:40:06,592
You can do this.

734
00:40:09,388 --> 00:40:11,323
I've always found it confusing.

735
00:40:11,848 --> 00:40:15,120
If you know both the bride and the
groom, which side do you sit on ?

736
00:40:15,888 --> 00:40:18,271
I just look for the hottest chick
in the room and sit next to her.

737
00:40:18,435 --> 00:40:21,041
- Stop.
- Wanna ditch the reception,
grab a drink instead ?

738
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:21,850
Stop it.

739
00:40:23,696 --> 00:40:24,613
You don't want me.

740
00:40:24,887 --> 00:40:26,773
- Maybe I do.
- No, you don't.

741
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,143
You want Ava.

742
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:33,362
She's not Ava anymore. She's Rebecca
now, and I barely know her.

743
00:40:34,436 --> 00:40:35,503
Look at me.

744
00:40:36,756 --> 00:40:40,363
Look at me.
You suck.

745
00:40:41,036 --> 00:40:45,223
To me, you suck.
I kind of... hate you.

746
00:40:45,707 --> 00:40:46,933
But, Alex,

747
00:40:47,395 --> 00:40:49,842
we do not get unlimited chances

748
00:40:50,355 --> 00:40:52,673
to have the things we want. And this

749
00:40:53,188 --> 00:40:55,831
I know... nothing is worse

750
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:59,171
than missing an opportunity
that could've changed your life.

751
00:40:59,698 --> 00:41:03,542
And no matter what her name is,
she'll always be Ava to you.

752
00:41:09,328 --> 00:41:10,713
Dr. Bailey.

753
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:15,962
- You didn't go to the wedding either.
- No.

754
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:22,721
I am... so sorry, George.

755
00:41:23,905 --> 00:41:29,042
So, um... what do I do now ?

756
00:41:30,495 --> 00:41:34,780
You fail your intern test,
you have two options. You can...

757
00:41:35,647 --> 00:41:39,450
walk away from being
a surgical resident altogether,

758
00:41:39,765 --> 00:41:43,232
or you can start
from the very beginning.

759
00:41:43,846 --> 00:41:45,823
Repeat my internship ?

760
00:41:47,975 --> 00:41:49,030
No

761
00:41:51,766 --> 00:41:52,480
I can't.

762
00:41:57,758 --> 00:41:58,681
I can't.

763
00:42:11,037 --> 00:42:15,080
did I...
did I fail you, george ?

764
00:42:15,427 --> 00:42:16,653
No.

765
00:42:19,958 --> 00:42:21,050
No.

766
00:42:23,726 --> 00:42:25,513
I failed you.

767
00:42:37,135 --> 00:42:40,913
Ooh. It looks so pretty
in there. I see Burke.

768
00:42:42,217 --> 00:42:45,923
- Yang the twins looks nice in that dress.
- Thank you.

769
00:42:46,407 --> 00:42:47,033
Sort of.

770
00:42:47,425 --> 00:42:48,503
I gotta go. Congrats

771
00:42:48,577 --> 00:42:51,120
- You're on call ?
- Wait, Alex. Did you see George in here ?

772
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:53,440
I don't see him.

773
00:42:53,987 --> 00:42:58,162
He's, uh... probably gonna be late.
We had kind of a big, emotional day.

774
00:42:58,538 --> 00:42:59,473
- Oh, really ?
- Yeah.

775
00:42:59,608 --> 00:43:02,162
Did something happen
between you two ? I mean...

776
00:43:02,267 --> 00:43:03,851
No. It's just that I was
named chief resident

777
00:43:04,465 --> 00:43:06,033
Plus we decided to have a baby,

778
00:43:08,365 --> 00:43:09,001
A baby ?

779
00:43:09,096 --> 00:43:10,790
Yeah, we're trying.
We tried today, in fact.

780
00:43:11,377 --> 00:43:14,113
- Wow.
- Yeah. Big day.

781
00:43:19,815 --> 00:43:21,392
This is it.

782
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:22,482
- Okay ?
- Yeah.

783
00:43:22,565 --> 00:43:24,821
- You have the bouquet. I have the ring.
- Yeah. Yeah.

784
00:43:25,476 --> 00:43:27,451
- You remember your vows ?
- Yeah. Okay. I wrote them on my...

785
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,091
Oh, my god

786
00:43:32,035 --> 00:43:32,702
I scrubbed in.

787
00:43:33,745 --> 00:43:36,110
I scrubbed in, and the vows were
on my hand. I scrubbed off my vows.

788
00:43:36,735 --> 00:43:37,660
Oh, okay.

789
00:43:38,127 --> 00:43:39,661
Hello ? I... I scrubbed off my vows.

790
00:43:39,787 --> 00:43:40,712
I... I can't... I can't do this.

791
00:43:40,757 --> 00:43:42,352
I don't have any... I don't have
anything on my hand !

792
00:43:50,388 --> 00:43:51,861
I should go see
what's going on.

793
00:43:52,477 --> 00:43:56,413
Well, Cristina wouldn't be Cristina
if she didn't need a little push.

794
00:43:57,476 --> 00:43:59,521
There are no words in my head. Okay ?
I have no vows.

795
00:43:59,648 --> 00:44:02,000
- No vows.
- It's okay. It's going to be okay.

796
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:04,291
You know what ? Stop saying that !
Will you say sometng else ?

797
00:44:04,818 --> 00:44:06,902
- Like what?
- Say something that is gonna help me.

798
00:44:06,998 --> 00:44:08,332
Okay, okay !

799
00:44:10,695 --> 00:44:12,131
Meredith, please. You know what ?
Say something.

800
00:44:12,196 --> 00:44:14,152
Say... you know what?
I don't know what. Say... say... okay.

801
00:44:14,558 --> 00:44:16,342
Say what I would say to you
if you were me.

802
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:18,511
- Okay.
- Good.

803
00:44:18,677 --> 00:44:19,673
- Got it.
- Good, go.

804
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:22,580
Stop whining.

805
00:44:23,416 --> 00:44:24,420
This is your wedding day.

806
00:44:24,627 --> 00:44:26,741
You will go down that aisle
and you will get married.

807
00:44:26,845 --> 00:44:29,412
If have to kick your ass every step
of the way to get you there,

808
00:44:29,556 --> 00:44:31,760
you will walk down the aisle.
You will get married.

809
00:44:31,805 --> 00:44:33,721
Do you hear me, Cristina ?
We need this.

810
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,291
We need you
to get your happy ending.

811
00:44:39,196 --> 00:44:40,851
- Okay, I'm ready.
- All right, then.

812
00:44:41,897 --> 00:44:42,821
My train.

813
00:44:44,386 --> 00:44:45,310
I'll go.

814
00:45:21,798 --> 00:45:23,411
Oh. I'm ready. I'm fine. I...

815
00:45:23,435 --> 00:45:24,993
Meredith talked me down.
Really, I'm fine.

816
00:45:25,015 --> 00:45:26,400
Go, go, go. I'll be right behind you.

817
00:45:28,698 --> 00:45:29,573
I'm sorry.

818
00:45:33,195 --> 00:45:34,272
I can do this.

819
00:45:34,275 --> 00:45:37,042
You know, I had a momentary freak out,
but now I'm fine. I can do this. Go.

820
00:45:37,145 --> 00:45:38,572
But you don't want to do this.

821
00:45:40,595 --> 00:45:43,112
I'm up there waiting for you
to come down the aisle,

822
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,170
and I knew you don't want to come.

823
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:49,581
I know you don't want to come but that
you'll come anyway because you love me.

824
00:45:52,088 --> 00:45:53,472
And if I loved you...

825
00:45:53,477 --> 00:45:56,140
if I loved you,

826
00:45:56,497 --> 00:45:58,421
not the woman that I'm trying
to make you be, not

827
00:45:58,425 --> 00:46:00,482
the woman that I hope you'll become,

828
00:46:01,638 --> 00:46:02,773
but you...

829
00:46:04,258 --> 00:46:05,353
if I did...

830
00:46:06,785 --> 00:46:08,761
I wouldn't be up there waiting for you.

831
00:46:11,618 --> 00:46:13,170
I would be letting you go.

832
00:46:17,647 --> 00:46:19,722
I am wearing the dress.

833
00:46:20,057 --> 00:46:21,143
I'm ready.

834
00:46:21,368 --> 00:46:24,861
And... and maybe I didn't want to
before, but I want to now.

835
00:46:24,868 --> 00:46:26,711
I really think I want this.

836
00:46:27,247 --> 00:46:28,492
And I really wish

837
00:46:28,897 --> 00:46:30,180
that you didn't think.

838
00:46:31,636 --> 00:46:33,053
I wish that you knew.

839
00:47:07,795 --> 00:47:09,463
It's over.

840
00:47:10,448 --> 00:47:12,203
You can all go home.

841
00:47:13,896 --> 00:47:15,143
It's over.

842
00:47:18,177 --> 00:47:19,901
It's so over.

843
00:48:28,777 --> 00:48:29,930
He's gone.

844
00:48:31,728 --> 00:48:33,802
I... I... I don't think he's gone.

845
00:48:33,978 --> 00:48:36,362
- Uh, his stuff is steel here.
- No, it isn't.

846
00:48:36,368 --> 00:48:39,203
His trumpet was here.

847
00:48:40,508 --> 00:48:43,040
His entire Eugene Foote collection...

848
00:48:43,468 --> 00:48:45,002
vinyls and cds...

849
00:48:45,316 --> 00:48:48,663
his grandmother's picture
was by the bed.

850
00:48:49,517 --> 00:48:53,880
His lucky scrub cap was
hanging on the door.

851
00:49:01,166 --> 00:49:02,821
He's gone.

852
00:49:05,638 --> 00:49:06,582
I'm...

853
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:09,433
I'm free.

854
00:49:12,666 --> 00:49:13,293
Damn it.

855
00:49:15,516 --> 00:49:16,141
Damn it.

856
00:49:17,207 --> 00:49:17,991
Damn it.

857
00:49:18,156 --> 00:49:19,032
Damn it.

858
00:49:20,038 --> 00:49:22,061
Oh, god. Get this off me.

859
00:49:22,447 --> 00:49:24,003
Take this off ! Take this off !

860
00:49:24,565 --> 00:49:25,362
Please, just...

861
00:49:28,116 --> 00:49:30,042
I can't...

862
00:49:31,428 --> 00:49:34,642
help me, help me, help me !

863
00:50:08,085 --> 00:50:09,300
Ah, nice.

864
00:50:09,436 --> 00:50:10,922
Do we get assigned lockers here or what ?

865
00:50:10,928 --> 00:50:12,112
Dude, it stinks in here.

866
00:50:12,115 --> 00:50:14,571
- What do you want ? It's a locker room.
- No, it's our locker room.

867
00:50:14,765 --> 00:50:16,091
You guys, look, bloody scrubs.

868
00:50:21,068 --> 00:50:21,501
Hi.

869
00:50:21,816 --> 00:50:22,312
Hi.

870
00:50:23,295 --> 00:50:26,220
- Come on, you guys.
Let's, let's go check out the cafeteria.
- Yeah.

871
00:50:29,757 --> 00:50:30,643
Hey.

872
00:50:32,136 --> 00:50:32,711
Hi.

873
00:50:33,028 --> 00:50:35,232
- We're the new interns.
- Yeah.

874
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:40,361
Well, you look seasoned and wise.
Um... got any advice ?

875
00:50:41,426 --> 00:50:42,421
No.

876
00:50:46,718 --> 00:50:50,121
Learn how to do an appendectomy
start to finish before your first day.

877
00:50:53,876 --> 00:50:55,203
- You're leaving ?
- Yeah.

878
00:50:55,958 --> 00:50:57,141
Better offer?

879
00:50:57,747 --> 00:51:02,081
Just, uh... you know, life.

880
00:51:04,068 --> 00:51:04,560
Yeah.

881
00:51:05,856 --> 00:51:08,342
Anyways, uh, good luck with...

882
00:51:09,057 --> 00:51:10,591
life, doctor...

883
00:51:12,845 --> 00:51:13,961
My name is George.

884
00:51:13,986 --> 00:51:16,031
I'm Lexie. Lexie Grey.

885
00:51:21,396 --> 00:51:22,600
Congratulations.

886
00:51:22,605 --> 00:51:24,121
You'll make a fine chief.

887
00:51:27,978 --> 00:51:28,763
Derek ?

888
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:31,261
I'm not the best man for this job.

889
00:51:32,868 --> 00:51:34,311
You're the best man for this job.

890
00:51:34,478 --> 00:51:35,993
What are you talking about, Derek ?

891
00:51:37,597 --> 00:51:40,132
A good chief learns from his mistakes.

892
00:51:40,137 --> 00:51:42,681
I'm still working on that. But you...

893
00:51:43,457 --> 00:51:46,242
if you had a chance to do it all over
again, you'd do it differently.

894
00:51:47,196 --> 00:51:47,833
Go ahead.

895
00:51:48,756 --> 00:51:49,952
Do it all over again.

896
00:51:51,497 --> 00:51:52,573
Be the best man.

897
00:51:53,546 --> 00:51:58,033
