1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,057
Previously on "Grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,232 --> 00:00:03,895
George's dad got admitted last night.

3
00:00:03,953 --> 00:00:05,878
I met a sister I never knew I had.

4
00:00:05,951 --> 00:00:08,825
Can you imagine...
Your whole family you know nothing about ?

5
00:00:08,871 --> 00:00:10,365
I'm just asking about your dad.

6
00:00:10,484 --> 00:00:12,763
Why do you care ?
You broke up with me, remember ?

7
00:00:12,928 --> 00:00:16,939
Mr. O'Malley has elected to have Dr. Hahn
perform his valve replacement.

8
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:18,546
- I can clear you for surgery.
- You're sure ?

9
00:00:18,612 --> 00:00:19,349
Yeah, absolutely.

10
00:00:19,397 --> 00:00:23,290
I need you to tell me why you
didn't want me in on your surgery.

11
00:00:23,342 --> 00:00:24,798
I'm afraid I just couldn't use you.

12
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:26,284
I can't see your mother anymore.

13
00:00:26,606 --> 00:00:28,973
It's time for you to retire, Richard.

14
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:30,290
I'm going to be chief.

15
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:32,130
I had a tremor and I didn't
say anything about it.

16
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:35,800
- We crossed the line.
- You dragged me across the line.

17
00:00:45,557 --> 00:00:48,351
He's with her.
He's with that woman... His wife.

18
00:00:48,528 --> 00:00:50,621
I don't think he is, not anymore.

19
00:00:50,658 --> 00:00:53,403
He is. I mean, why would he do that ?
He loves me.

20
00:00:54,527 --> 00:00:56,080
I mean, why would he go back to her?

21
00:00:56,267 --> 00:00:57,663
I gave up everything for him.

22
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:00,743
Mom.

23
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:05,082
Mom, look at me.

24
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:13,570
This happened... a very long time ago.
This is not happening now.

25
00:01:19,898 --> 00:01:22,383
It's because I have a daughter, isn't it ?

26
00:01:23,195 --> 00:01:27,280
He always said he didn't want kids.
I should never have had a kid.

27
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:48,843
What's gonna happen to them ?

28
00:01:48,947 --> 00:01:51,581
- What?
- Dr. Burke and dr. Yang...

29
00:01:51,795 --> 00:01:54,451
What are you gonna do to them,
their punishment ?

30
00:01:54,486 --> 00:01:57,143
- Dr. Bailey...
- There's a need for justice here.

31
00:01:57,766 --> 00:01:58,410
Justice ?

32
00:01:58,488 --> 00:02:02,203
Justice has no definition within the
four walls of a hospital, Dr. Bailey.

33
00:02:02,546 --> 00:02:05,020
- This isn't a court of law.
- I just wannna know what's gonna be done.

34
00:02:05,156 --> 00:02:08,662
Legally and technically, they've done
nothing wrong. Nobody died,

35
00:02:08,735 --> 00:02:11,773
there was no malpractice.
I haven't made a decision.

36
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:12,503
Excuse me.

37
00:02:12,956 --> 00:02:13,873
- He...
- He what ?

38
00:02:16,716 --> 00:02:17,782
Nothin'.

39
00:02:18,476 --> 00:02:21,761
Dr. Yang, you'll go back on the floor
with Dr. Bailey.

40
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:24,741
- Sir...
- Dr. Bailey, am I not understanding this ?

41
00:02:24,788 --> 00:02:27,160
Does this situation directly
harm you in some way?

42
00:02:28,427 --> 00:02:31,363
No, Sir.
I am fine.

43
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:33,191
Then get back to work.

44
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:41,773
Burke, you and Shepherd need to come
together on this tremor
as soon as possible.

45
00:02:41,817 --> 00:02:43,211
- He doesn't want my help.
- Derek...

46
00:02:43,306 --> 00:02:44,310
I don't want his help.

47
00:02:44,446 --> 00:02:48,161
That hand is worth $2 million.
I want it fixed,

48
00:02:48,327 --> 00:02:50,501
and I want it fixed yesterday.

49
00:02:50,576 --> 00:02:51,833
Figure it out.

50
00:02:52,316 --> 00:02:56,372
Listen, your brothers are good boys,
but they're not that responsible.

51
00:02:56,496 --> 00:02:57,601
It's a standard procedure.

52
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:58,911
It's just that,

53
00:02:59,338 --> 00:03:01,181
- if things go wrong...
- Dad...
- If

54
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:03,113
things go wrong,

55
00:03:03,506 --> 00:03:07,442
the life insurance papers are in the
second drawer in my nightstand...

56
00:03:08,016 --> 00:03:11,940
and my... magazines are in the garage

57
00:03:12,086 --> 00:03:13,823
- with the truck manuals.
- Your magazines ?

58
00:03:14,096 --> 00:03:17,093
Get'em outta there
so your ma doesn't see them.

59
00:03:17,735 --> 00:03:18,823
Your magazines ?

60
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:26,260
Good morning, Mr. O'Malley.
Just wanted to stop by before the surgery
and see how that collarbone was healing.

61
00:03:28,735 --> 00:03:32,751
George... You're not gonna say hello
to Dr. Torres ?

62
00:03:35,618 --> 00:03:37,660
I'm gonna see you for rounds, Dad.

63
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:45,582
If you had you told me that you were
developing a tremor, I could've run some tests.

64
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:49,752
The likelihood is that there's just some
compression of the structures around the injury.

65
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:51,780
- I can go in there...
- I don't want another surgery.

66
00:03:53,147 --> 00:03:55,183
- It could be a small clot. I just go in--
- Shepherd,

67
00:03:56,256 --> 00:03:59,571
I don't want another surgery.
The first one caused enough damage.

68
00:04:01,316 --> 00:04:02,172
I can do this.

69
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:05,912
That's what you said the last time.
Now I have a tremor.

70
00:04:10,305 --> 00:04:13,201
Maybe she'll be on "look but don't touch"
patrol, too. At least I'd have some company.

71
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:17,441
Whatever she gets, I hope it's bad,
Really bad.

72
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:18,653
She made a mistake.

73
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:19,653
- A mistake ?
- We all...

74
00:04:21,148 --> 00:04:24,983
She was gonna let Burke... Burke with
the shaky hand operate on my father.

75
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,780
Could you stop looking at me like that ?

76
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:38,353
It's creepy, and it makes me feel
like you haven't been fed.

77
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:48,182
- How's it going ?
- How's what going ?

78
00:04:48,898 --> 00:04:51,593
You and Burke, are you okay ?

79
00:04:52,628 --> 00:04:54,360
We're existing in total silence.

80
00:04:54,546 --> 00:04:58,381
- He's not talking to you ?
- I'm not talking to him either.

81
00:04:59,195 --> 00:05:00,701
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

82
00:05:00,805 --> 00:05:02,012
Stop  asking me that.

83
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,510
- I'm making an effort here.
- Please don't.

84
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:07,172
Rounds started 30 seconds ago.

85
00:05:08,827 --> 00:05:12,211
The chief may be confused about
punishment for you, but I'm not.

86
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:15,323
You're late again, you will find
another resident.

87
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:20,380
Dr. Bailey, can I have Grey ?

88
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:21,560
You can have'em all.

89
00:05:22,226 --> 00:05:23,983
Something you needed, Dr. Montgomery ?

90
00:05:24,018 --> 00:05:26,701
This is none of my business, but I just
thought you might want to be warned.

91
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:27,832
I'm sorry. I don't know...

92
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:31,021
Your sister Molly's just been admitted
for an emergency c-section.

93
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:32,300
Molly's not my sister.

94
00:05:32,397 --> 00:05:35,243
Okay, but technically, she is,
you have the same father.

95
00:05:35,276 --> 00:05:37,961
- And, uh, Susan--
- Susan Grey is definitely not my mother.

96
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:41,762
I appreciate you're trying to be nice
and everything, but I really don't
even need to know this,

97
00:05:41,826 --> 00:05:43,560
- So...
- Actually you do.

98
00:05:47,726 --> 00:05:48,701
- Hello, Meredith.

99
00:05:52,587 --> 00:05:53,682
Hi, mom.

100
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:56,843
Honey. Oh.

101
00:05:57,676 --> 00:06:00,210
I put out some breakfast in case you
kids haven't eaten yet.

102
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:01,750
- Score.
- Karev.

103
00:06:02,085 --> 00:06:03,923
Hey, ready for the big day, pops ?

104
00:06:04,036 --> 00:06:04,563
Mm, food.

105
00:06:06,705 --> 00:06:09,200
All right, let's make this fast,
people. I have a day.

106
00:06:09,298 --> 00:06:11,031
- Which one of the interns is mine ?
- It's mine.

107
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:12,331
He's family, and she's a candy striper.

108
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:13,770
- I'm ready.
- What if you did pick me ?

109
00:06:13,827 --> 00:06:14,553
What if you picked me?

110
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:15,320
Pick me !

111
00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:17,220
Guys, this is serious.

112
00:06:19,658 --> 00:06:20,291
Yang.

113
00:06:20,778 --> 00:06:22,143
- What ?
- What ?

114
00:06:22,587 --> 00:06:28,462
Dr. Hahn, Cristina is very good with cardio.
I'm sure you can use her for the day.

115
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:33,181
What are you waiting for, Yang ?
Present the case.

116
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:38,081
Harold O'Malley, 63, diagnosed with
esophageal cancer and severe aortic regurge,

117
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:40,423
he is scheduled for aortic valve
replacement this afternoon.

118
00:06:40,488 --> 00:06:42,872
Dude, I wanted that surgery, 
and she hands it to Yang.

119
00:06:42,897 --> 00:06:45,803
- I haven't had a cardiac case in ages.
- It's not a case. It's my father.

120
00:06:45,926 --> 00:06:49,431
I guess there's a double standard now.
Yang does something wrong, and
she gets rewarded. That's fair.

121
00:06:49,527 --> 00:06:49,991
Yeah.

122
00:06:52,607 --> 00:06:56,841
If you thumb suckers don't stop whining,
I swear I won't show you what's behind this door,

123
00:06:56,947 --> 00:06:59,632
and trust me, you want to see
what's behind this door.

124
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:07,073
Excuse me, Doctors, you're gonna have
to wait a few minutes. He's gotta pee.

125
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:09,021
Every five minutes, he's gotta pee.

126
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:10,121
I've always had a small bladder.

127
00:07:10,155 --> 00:07:11,743
I can't live like this any longer.

128
00:07:11,755 --> 00:07:13,841
You  ? I'm the one who has to
put up with your whining.

129
00:07:13,897 --> 00:07:15,080
Like the whining you're doing right now ?

130
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:17,083
Okay, you know what ?
If you don't move, it's gonna go all over your leg

131
00:07:17,207 --> 00:07:18,380
So what else is new ?

132
00:07:24,907 --> 00:07:27,722
Now which one of you thinks
that Yang got the better case ?

133
00:07:30,978 --> 00:07:32,630
That's what I thought.

134
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:41,343
Jake and Peter Weitzman,
35-year-old pygopagus

135
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:45,023
conjoined twins attached at
the lumbosacral junction.

136
00:07:45,128 --> 00:07:46,593
But not for long, right, Dr. Webber ?

137
00:07:46,645 --> 00:07:50,140
The Weitzmans came about six months ago
for a separation procedure.

138
00:07:50,217 --> 00:07:51,563
They opted out because of the risk.

139
00:07:51,648 --> 00:07:52,430
Pete chickened out.

140
00:07:52,498 --> 00:07:56,741
Well, forgive me for wanting to live
longer, even if it meant living with you.

141
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,470
Yeah ? Well, you wasted
six months of our lives...

142
00:07:58,508 --> 00:07:59,103
Oh, come on.

143
00:07:59,127 --> 00:08:00,210
- Thank you very much.
- Stop it.

144
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:01,638
You guys came back at the right time.

145
00:08:01,711 --> 00:08:03,704
We just scored New York's
top plastic surgeon.

146
00:08:03,846 --> 00:08:07,003
Mark Sloan, plastics, and you remember
Dr. Shepherd, your neurosurgeon.

147
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:11,110
- We, uh, we used to work
as a team, actually.

148
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:12,932
We worked together.
We were never actually a team.

149
00:08:12,957 --> 00:08:13,392
I hear ya.

150
00:08:13,466 --> 00:08:15,831
- Mr. Weitzman ?
- Call me Jake.
- Call me Pete.

151
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,652
Jake, Pete, um, why...
do you mind me asking why now

152
00:08:19,757 --> 00:08:22,200
when you thought the procedure
was too risky six months ago ?

153
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:24,042
- Well...
- Guys.

154
00:08:24,906 --> 00:08:26,060
Whoa.

155
00:08:26,596 --> 00:08:29,360
That's a lot of doctors. I'm...
I'm just gonna come back later.

156
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,020
No, no, no, no, no.
Elena, come in, come in.

157
00:08:31,247 --> 00:08:32,493
You wanted to know why now.

158
00:08:33,037 --> 00:08:33,810
This is why...

159
00:08:34,187 --> 00:08:36,062
The love of my life... Elena.

160
00:08:36,256 --> 00:08:37,300
Jake, don't...

161
00:08:37,665 --> 00:08:41,141
I told him not to do this, not for me
anyway,'cause that's just crazy.

162
00:08:41,535 --> 00:08:44,233
'Cause Pete said that
they could end up paralyzed.

163
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:45,882
They could end up dead.

164
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:47,753
What do you tell her
things like that for ?

165
00:08:47,765 --> 00:08:49,851
I wasn't telling her. I was telling you.

166
00:08:49,887 --> 00:08:52,302
She just happens to be
the only one who listens to me.

167
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:53,303
She happens to be right.

168
00:08:54,426 --> 00:08:57,232
Do you know what it's like to have to
be stuck to the same person...

169
00:08:56,957 --> 00:08:57,881
Here we go.

170
00:08:57,675 --> 00:08:58,592
Every... That's right.

171
00:08:58,677 --> 00:08:59,483
Here we go.

172
00:08:59,577 --> 00:09:03,652
Do you know what it's like to have to be
with the same person every minute of every day,

173
00:09:03,898 --> 00:09:07,603
To not have anything that's just yours,
not be able to do anything on your own ?

174
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:10,023
Well, nobody should have to
live like that.

175
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:11,692
What do you think, Pete ?

176
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:17,090
I think, why would I want to be attached
to someone who doesn't want to be
attached to me ?

177
00:09:21,136 --> 00:09:22,273
I'm calling it. It's mine

178
00:09:22,317 --> 00:09:24,171
I have two brothers.
I feel their pain.

179
00:09:24,186 --> 00:09:25,532
I would be great at watching this.

180
00:09:25,617 --> 00:09:27,713
- Zip it, all of you.
- We're on the case, right ?

181
00:09:28,515 --> 00:09:29,602
- Right.
- Yes !

182
00:09:29,678 --> 00:09:30,213
Awesome.

183
00:09:30,677 --> 00:09:32,403
Stevens, you are to...

184
00:09:32,427 --> 00:09:34,192
Look and not touch or speak or breathe.
I got it.

185
00:09:35,045 --> 00:09:36,920
So this is the crack team, huh ?

186
00:09:37,007 --> 00:09:38,082
Feel  free to take one.

187
00:09:38,148 --> 00:09:40,452
How about I take the one that doesn't
touch or speak or breathe ?

188
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:41,413
Right.

189
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:42,030
Damn it.

190
00:09:44,638 --> 00:09:47,161
Thank you... for picking me.
Even just observing.

191
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:49,450
I thought you might be fun
to look at while I work.

192
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,262
Will you be working on both the
nerve graft and the skin reconstruction ?

193
00:09:53,347 --> 00:09:57,041
Yes, and I think I'll handle them a whole
lot better with a little caffeine in my system.

194
00:09:57,095 --> 00:10:02,243
Get me a blueberry scone, a bone dry cappuccino
and a little something for yourself.

195
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:08,031
There's a cafeteria on the second floor
and a coffee cart in the lobby.

196
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:10,670
Feisty. Cappuccino.

197
00:10:10,727 --> 00:10:12,922
You can kick me back to Bailey
if you want. I don't do coffee.

198
00:10:15,868 --> 00:10:18,572
So how will you be handling the nerve
graft and the skin reconstruction ?

199
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,723
Conjoined twins, Derek.

200
00:10:21,418 --> 00:10:22,270
I know, Chief.

201
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:26,470
Conjoined adult twins.

202
00:10:26,928 --> 00:10:31,202
I mean, it's rare enough to separate
conjoined infants. But conjoined adults ?

203
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:31,783
Mm-hmm.

204
00:10:31,986 --> 00:10:33,301
Can you imagine the press,

205
00:10:33,408 --> 00:10:35,522
what a surgery like this 
could do for this hospital ?

206
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:37,273
I know, which is why
I don't think we should do it.

207
00:10:37,945 --> 00:10:40,030
Their spines are fused together
from the l4 down.

208
00:10:40,147 --> 00:10:42,983
Their blood flow
is intricately connected.

209
00:10:43,246 --> 00:10:44,900
They could end up paralyzed,
or even dead.

210
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:50,693
Your patients want this operation, Derek.

211
00:10:51,015 --> 00:10:52,373
Why are you backing out ?

212
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:54,023
This isn't like you.

213
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:59,323
Unless there's incontrovertible evidence
that this surgery can't be done,
we're moving forward.

214
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:05,143
Your  father's not here.

215
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:07,871
Thatcher's at Harvard med visiting Lexie.

216
00:11:07,996 --> 00:11:09,503
We thought we had a lot of time.

217
00:11:09,786 --> 00:11:13,740
I mean, Molly's only 36 weeks, and Dr.
Montgomery's been trying to stop the contractions,

218
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:16,060
but I guess the baby
is ready to come out.

219
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:18,422
Well, do you need anything else or...

220
00:11:18,737 --> 00:11:22,821
Yeah, actually, I could use an intern for this.
Can you ask Dr. Bailey for someone ?

221
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:26,163
Uh... I'll do it.

222
00:11:26,898 --> 00:11:27,810
Are you sure ?

223
00:11:28,435 --> 00:11:29,352
Yeah, I'm fine.

224
00:11:29,686 --> 00:11:30,233
Okay.

225
00:11:30,385 --> 00:11:33,240
It'll be so nice to have a familiar face
in the operating room.

226
00:11:33,415 --> 00:11:33,760
Thank you

227
00:11:35,747 --> 00:11:36,663
for being here.

228
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:39,942
It's my job to be here, so...

229
00:11:40,655 --> 00:11:42,572
Uh, does Molly know who I am ?

230
00:11:42,845 --> 00:11:43,870
She doesn't.

231
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:46,372
I wanted to tell her, but your father...

232
00:11:46,775 --> 00:11:47,691
- He just... He...
- No,

233
00:11:47,805 --> 00:11:50,803
It's better. It's better that she
not know. It's good.

234
00:11:51,158 --> 00:11:56,030
So I think, uh, Molly should be ready
in the O.R. Susan, you'll need scrubs
and a cap.

235
00:11:56,627 --> 00:11:58,140
I'm about to be a grandmother.

236
00:11:58,277 --> 00:12:01,001
Yes, in about a half an hour,
you will be a grandmother.

237
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,802
Oh,  my. Okay.

238
00:12:03,027 --> 00:12:04,723
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

239
00:12:05,797 --> 00:12:07,223
Here we go.

240
00:12:07,887 --> 00:12:10,781
We're going to be replacing your aortic
valve with a porcine valve.

241
00:12:10,838 --> 00:12:12,622
Well, Georgie says it's gonna be okay.

242
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:14,592
He says they know what they're doing.

243
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:16,860
Besides, if you die,

244
00:12:16,968 --> 00:12:17,642
I'll kill you.

245
00:12:17,718 --> 00:12:19,643
Well, it's a good thing
we're doing this today.

246
00:12:17,716 --> 00:12:19,642
Well, it's a good thing we're doing this today.
We noticed you had a lot
of irregular heart rhythms
this morning.

247
00:12:19,675 --> 00:12:22,051
We noticed you had a lot of irregular
heart rhythms this morning.

248
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:23,592
Did you check his dig level ?

249
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:24,802
Excuse me.

250
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:25,603
What are you doing ?

251
00:12:26,255 --> 00:12:28,642
This morning his potassium
was a borderline low.

252
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:30,380
All right, we've got a handle
on things here.

253
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:32,510
Oh, I'm sure you do.

254
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:38,300
Uh, george, I think maybe
you should step outside.

255
00:12:38,327 --> 00:12:39,443
You don't talk to me like that.

256
00:12:39,465 --> 00:12:40,860
Oh, she's waking up the baby.

257
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,032
Ronny, shut up.

258
00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:43,511
Be careful, Dr. Hahn,

259
00:12:43,685 --> 00:12:45,101
- He might start crying.
- I said shut up.

260
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:47,231
All right, you are out of here.

261
00:12:47,285 --> 00:12:49,190
No, I'm not.

262
00:12:49,297 --> 00:12:53,751
- Georgie.
- No, uh, she can't kick me out.
She has no right. I hired her.

263
00:12:56,206 --> 00:12:57,253
I'm staying.

264
00:12:59,135 --> 00:13:00,591
How you doing there, Molly ?

265
00:13:00,758 --> 00:13:01,430
Okay.

266
00:13:02,027 --> 00:13:03,472
I'm just excited to see my girl.

267
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:06,682
Well, you're gonna get to take a look
at her in just a couple of minutes.

268
00:13:07,218 --> 00:13:08,823
Dr. Grey, can you give me
a little more traction ?

269
00:13:09,937 --> 00:13:11,181
Vitals are holding steady.

270
00:13:12,047 --> 00:13:13,020
Can you see her yet ?

271
00:13:13,128 --> 00:13:16,672
No. I'm not gonna look
until the blood's all gone.

272
00:13:18,485 --> 00:13:20,161
You want to cut the cord, Dr. Grey ?

273
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,663
The warmer is ready when you need it,
Dr. Montgomery.

274
00:13:27,136 --> 00:13:30,101
Dr. Grey, will you follow me ?
Dr. Knox, will you close for me, please ?

275
00:13:30,486 --> 00:13:31,673
Bag valve mask.

276
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:34,363
We have to stabilize this baby
and get it into surgery.

277
00:13:34,576 --> 00:13:36,283
- Get her on the monitor.
- What's happening ?

278
00:13:37,197 --> 00:13:38,023
What's wrong with her ?

279
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:40,550
Susan, I need you to stand back
and stay with molly, please.

280
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:41,270
What's wrong with her ?

281
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:44,031
- No response to stimulation.
- Grey, you want to talk her through this ?

282
00:13:44,135 --> 00:13:45,173
Let's try suction.

283
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:49,251
Grey, I need your help here.

284
00:13:52,645 --> 00:13:54,921
The baby is not breathing.

285
00:13:55,865 --> 00:13:59,152
What ?
What did she say ?

286
00:14:06,728 --> 00:14:07,973
You left me hanging in there, Grey.

287
00:14:08,017 --> 00:14:09,141
I'm sorry. I was...

288
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:10,830
I'm sorry.

289
00:14:10,947 --> 00:14:12,353
Do you need me to scrub in on the baby ?

290
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:14,241
No. I want you to keep
molly and her mother

291
00:14:14,298 --> 00:14:16,170
apprised of the baby's condition
while I operate.

292
00:14:16,576 --> 00:14:18,051
I'm sure they'd rather talk to you.

293
00:14:18,137 --> 00:14:19,993
The baby's got jejunal atresia.

294
00:14:20,155 --> 00:14:21,181
She may die.

295
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:23,312
I got consent, but I don't
have time for updates.

296
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:26,930
I think I would really learn a lot
from observing this procedure.

297
00:14:27,057 --> 00:14:29,892
No, it was a mistake to let you in the O.R.
with your family in the first place.

298
00:14:29,938 --> 00:14:31,051
It's not gonna happen again.

299
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:32,891
Check in with me every hour.

300
00:14:35,586 --> 00:14:38,710
How many valve replacements have you
performed in your life, Dr. O'Malley ?

301
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:39,463
- None.
- None.

302
00:14:39,556 --> 00:14:41,880
And how many valve replacements
do you think Dr. Hahn has performed ?

303
00:14:41,908 --> 00:14:42,891
That is my father!

304
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,573
And you are in that room as his son.

305
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:46,581
You interns think you can do
whatever you want to do.

306
00:14:46,608 --> 00:14:48,080
Well, not anymore, not with me,

307
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,301
which is why you are going to stay away,

308
00:14:50,488 --> 00:14:51,953
50 feet away to be precise.

309
00:14:51,998 --> 00:14:55,020
You are going to remain 50 feet away
from your father at all times today,

310
00:14:55,055 --> 00:14:57,003
and, Dr. O'Malley, do not make me
tell you again.

311
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,611
Everything okay with the O'Malleys ?

312
00:15:06,775 --> 00:15:08,270
The kid's a pain in the ass.

313
00:15:08,358 --> 00:15:12,451
But Dr. Yang here is proving to be
an extremely capable asset.

314
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,340
I hear she studied under you.
You trained her well.

315
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:15,943
Yes.

316
00:15:18,677 --> 00:15:20,163
Well, she's very...

317
00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:24,300
professional.

318
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:38,483
What do you know about Dr. Levine ?

319
00:15:40,057 --> 00:15:41,043
Pretty good.

320
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:43,652
Better or worse than Dr. Korsikov ?

321
00:15:44,347 --> 00:15:45,411
Wait...

322
00:15:46,337 --> 00:15:51,001
why are you researching neurosurgeons
when you and I both know that Derek's
better than anybody ?

323
00:15:52,228 --> 00:15:53,292
I don't want Shepherd.

324
00:15:53,936 --> 00:15:54,891
You blaming this on him ?

325
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:58,922
You know, up until now,
I have not yelled.

326
00:16:00,817 --> 00:16:03,750
I have not yelled because you were
a guy in trouble,

327
00:16:04,156 --> 00:16:06,492
and I was supporting you.
But now...

328
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:09,761
- I am yelling !
- Chief.

329
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,011
I am yelling very loudly !

330
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:13,582
I want to retire, Burke!

331
00:16:13,658 --> 00:16:14,992
I want my wife back !

332
00:16:15,037 --> 00:16:16,650
And I passed the torch to you !

333
00:16:16,755 --> 00:16:19,481
I passed the torch to you,
and you blew it out !

334
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:24,642
Look, I know I let you down.

335
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,992
Burke...

336
00:16:32,337 --> 00:16:34,010
I'm tired.

337
00:16:34,968 --> 00:16:37,702
I'm tired of you men acting like boys.

338
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,002
You let me down.

339
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,060
And if you don't let Derek fix that hand,

340
00:16:44,286 --> 00:16:45,651
you're letting yourself down.

341
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:55,652
22 surgeons...
it takes 22 surgeons to do this.

342
00:16:56,457 --> 00:16:57,591
So where are we ?

343
00:16:57,737 --> 00:16:59,503
I've gotten to the cauda equina.

344
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:03,552
I'll be working on the musculature
of the perineal floor.

345
00:17:03,696 --> 00:17:06,192
I'll be harvesting
the sural nerve for transfer.

346
00:17:06,246 --> 00:17:07,630
Now once I resect this artery,

347
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:11,142
we're gonna have less than two minutes
before all sensation to these nerves are gone.

348
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:16,700
I'm pretty sure we'll have enough nerve
to transfer and cover the deficits.

349
00:17:16,728 --> 00:17:18,232
We can definitely do this.

350
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:19,871
Oh, damn it.

351
00:17:21,526 --> 00:17:23,290
It's gonna be a lot more
fragile in the body.

352
00:17:24,216 --> 00:17:26,262
It's one thing if this is a life-or-deh
situation

353
00:17:26,286 --> 00:17:27,923
and this is all we can do to save them.

354
00:17:28,758 --> 00:17:29,703
These guys are fine.

355
00:17:31,978 --> 00:17:33,091
This isn't worth the risk. 

356
00:17:41,216 --> 00:17:42,392
How is our baby ?

357
00:17:43,006 --> 00:17:46,960
She has an intestinal obstruction,
which is why she couldn't breathe.

358
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:50,330
Dr. Montgomery is operating
on her right now.

359
00:17:51,835 --> 00:17:52,952
I can't do this.

360
00:17:53,146 --> 00:17:55,110
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

361
00:17:55,268 --> 00:17:57,493
I am right here, baby,
and dad's on the way.

362
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:58,700
I have to call Eric.

363
00:17:58,798 --> 00:17:59,152
O kay.

364
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:00,981
I don't know what to tell him.

365
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:02,863
That's her husband. He's in Iraq.

366
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:03,871
I can't tell him this.

367
00:18:04,365 --> 00:18:05,572
He's gonna want to name her,

368
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:08,401
and I don't wanna name her'cause I don't
know how long she's gonna be ours.

369
00:18:08,617 --> 00:18:11,121
Oh, now... Shh.
We'll call him together.

370
00:18:11,646 --> 00:18:14,132
He's just gonna be happy
to hear your voice.

371
00:18:14,236 --> 00:18:16,292
The baby's gonna be okay.
You hear me ?

372
00:18:18,455 --> 00:18:19,491
I thought you were sloan's right hand.

373
00:18:19,517 --> 00:18:20,890
- Yeah, well, Sloan can kiss my--
- Ow...

374
00:18:21,608 --> 00:18:23,243
I haven't even put the needle in yet.

375
00:18:23,568 --> 00:18:24,122
Sorry.

376
00:18:24,595 --> 00:18:26,231
I'm just not a big fan of pain.

377
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:28,640
Well, you're about to have a fairly
extensive and painful surgery.

378
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,881
You think this is an elective procedure ?

379
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:34,482
That we're just coming in here because
we're getting on each other's nerves ?

380
00:18:34,576 --> 00:18:35,062
Please,

381
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:36,930
- You want to know the real reason ?
- Come on, Jake.

382
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:38,890
- She doesn't want...
- It's because...

383
00:18:38,926 --> 00:18:40,151
We have rules.

384
00:18:40,397 --> 00:18:40,841
Rules ?

385
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:43,232
Yeah, like say one of us
is on a dinner date,

386
00:18:43,507 --> 00:18:46,240
According to the rules, the other one's
supposed to sit there quietly,

387
00:18:46,276 --> 00:18:48,560
eat his falafe
and shut the hell up.

388
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,310
I try.

389
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:51,550
It's just the way you talk
to her sometimes--

390
00:18:51,557 --> 00:18:52,252
It's none of your business.

391
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:53,202
How is it none of my busins ?

392
00:18:53,246 --> 00:18:55,841
He sticks up for me, and I
think that that's kinda nice.

393
00:18:55,878 --> 00:18:57,791
Okay, you don't talk to him anymore.

394
00:18:58,068 --> 00:19:00,751
What ? Oh, we can't even
be friends now ?

395
00:19:01,596 --> 00:19:03,450
- We have other rules, too.
- Oh.

396
00:19:03,586 --> 00:19:05,533
Like for when we're with someone.

397
00:19:05,637 --> 00:19:09,941
- Got it.
- Sort of. No looking, no talking, no touching.

398
00:19:10,047 --> 00:19:11,452
It was an accident.

399
00:19:11,726 --> 00:19:13,160
Oh, this is gonna end badly.

400
00:19:14,077 --> 00:19:16,613
Baby, I told you,
I'm completely fine with it.

401
00:19:16,696 --> 00:19:19,992
How are you okay with the fact that he's
touching you while you're naked ?

402
00:19:23,076 --> 00:19:25,870
Uh... be... cause it wasn't a big deal.

403
00:19:26,277 --> 00:19:30,541
And it was kinda sweet and...
It just... It wasn't a big deal.

404
00:19:31,665 --> 00:19:37,581
Wait, you... You liked it.
You enjoyed it.

405
00:19:41,835 --> 00:19:47,442
I'm completely in love with you. That's
not even that you're... You're a great guy.
And...

406
00:19:47,806 --> 00:19:49,751
You know, when we make love,

407
00:19:50,247 --> 00:19:54,071
The... It's... It's great.
It's... It's really great.

408
00:19:54,697 --> 00:19:56,611
And I've never had that before and...

409
00:19:57,417 --> 00:20:00,883
It's just that when you fall asleep,

410
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:06,143
That, uh, Pete and I just... We talk.

411
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,083
And, um...

412
00:20:09,746 --> 00:20:12,182
- I really love that, too.
- Elena.
- No

413
00:20:12,398 --> 00:20:14,513
No. No, you have to choose.

414
00:20:15,796 --> 00:20:18,180
- What ?
- Him or me ?

415
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:21,521
We're gonna have this surgery,
and you can't have us both.

416
00:20:21,718 --> 00:20:24,541
So choose...
Him or me ?

417
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:34,050
See, this is the part where you're
supposed to say, "you, Jake. I choose you."

418
00:20:36,355 --> 00:20:39,200
I'm so sorry, Jake. I'm so sorry.

419
00:20:41,037 --> 00:20:41,793
Elena...

420
00:20:41,835 --> 00:20:42,713
Oh, God !

421
00:20:42,737 --> 00:20:44,563
- No, no, no !
- I swear to God...

422
00:20:44,596 --> 00:20:44,960
Jake, it's...

423
00:20:45,006 --> 00:20:47,831
- I am gonna kill you !
- Ow ! Get him off !

424
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:55,013
I think it's romantic... Two brothers
fighting... Over the same woman.

425
00:20:55,696 --> 00:20:59,021
You know what's freaky ? The whole
conjoined twin having sex in front of
the other one thing.

426
00:20:59,507 --> 00:21:01,161
How do you do that?

427
00:21:01,387 --> 00:21:03,190
Family is complicated.

428
00:21:03,735 --> 00:21:04,461
You're here.

429
00:21:05,157 --> 00:21:06,451
You haven't been kicked out
of the program yet.

430
00:21:06,476 --> 00:21:08,502
- Alex.
- No, not yet. I'm still here.

431
00:21:13,225 --> 00:21:14,380
How'd you do it ?

432
00:21:14,677 --> 00:21:17,941
I mean, did you have some kind of signal
in surgery so that the nurses wouldn't know,

433
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:18,951
- or did you--
- Alex--

434
00:21:18,997 --> 00:21:19,301
What ?

435
00:21:19,897 --> 00:21:21,693
I mean, I'm just wondering
how to get ahead around here.

436
00:21:22,136 --> 00:21:23,640
Me ? I get coffee for sloan.

437
00:21:23,835 --> 00:21:25,512
Yang. She gets surgeries
none of us would get.

438
00:21:25,605 --> 00:21:29,293
Got a head count on how many patients
you two lied to the past month ?

439
00:21:29,928 --> 00:21:30,412
George.

440
00:21:30,746 --> 00:21:33,603
Leave her alone. Her patients lived
so she gets to scrub in.

441
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:34,283
Izzie.

442
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,130
Meredith, please, can you
just stop defending me ?

443
00:21:48,455 --> 00:21:49,202
Ah.

444
00:21:49,528 --> 00:21:50,460
Ah.

445
00:21:50,948 --> 00:21:52,761
No, no, no, no. I'll, uh, I'll go.

446
00:21:52,888 --> 00:21:53,812
No, wait, wait.

447
00:21:54,867 --> 00:21:57,102
Georgie, you should make nice with her.

448
00:21:57,306 --> 00:21:59,792
- Look, dad...
- No, really, Mr. O'Malley, it's fine.

449
00:21:59,828 --> 00:22:00,830
It's not fine.

450
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:07,150
George, you're so angry.

451
00:22:07,696 --> 00:22:08,352
No, I'm not.

452
00:22:08,465 --> 00:22:11,822
- You've been picking fights every chance
you get, and that's not like you.
- Dad...

453
00:22:13,758 --> 00:22:14,690
You don't know what's been going on.

454
00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:16,852
Okay, then tell me.

455
00:22:17,497 --> 00:22:20,061
Why are you so mad at Dr. Torres ?

456
00:22:20,146 --> 00:22:22,431
- I should go. I have patients to see.
- No, you know what ?

457
00:22:22,516 --> 00:22:23,031
I'm gonna go.

458
00:22:23,136 --> 00:22:25,362
No ! Everybody stays.

459
00:22:29,276 --> 00:22:32,991
You're angry, Georgie...
at Callie, at your brothers,

460
00:22:33,307 --> 00:22:37,351
at Dr. Hahn, at Dr. Bailey,
at Dr. Yang, at Dr. Burke.

461
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:42,221
That's a long list of
people to be angry at.

462
00:22:43,336 --> 00:22:48,601
Especially when the person
you're really angry at... is me.

463
00:22:49,405 --> 00:22:50,012
Dad ?

464
00:22:51,386 --> 00:22:54,500
I drink and I smoke

465
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:58,251
and I don't exercise and I eat
all the wrong things, and now

466
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,940
I have cancer.

467
00:23:03,495 --> 00:23:07,323
And you have to take care of everything.
You have to take care of me.

468
00:23:07,508 --> 00:23:08,683
I don't mind.

469
00:23:12,098 --> 00:23:12,872
You do.

470
00:23:17,627 --> 00:23:21,813
You're mad at me, and that's okay
because

471
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:26,521
I'm mad at me, too. You think I want
to die and leave my boy in charge ?

472
00:23:29,926 --> 00:23:30,892
You are not gonna die.

473
00:23:39,255 --> 00:23:40,292
What's going on ?

474
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,322
You're not supposed to be
in here, Georgie.

475
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:44,232
Yeah, you're gonna get in trouble,
Georgie.

476
00:23:44,348 --> 00:23:45,640
Georgie doesn't work here !

477
00:23:45,668 --> 00:23:48,351
In this hospital, my name is
Dr. O'Malley !

478
00:23:50,358 --> 00:23:50,721
Dad?

479
00:23:52,157 --> 00:23:52,900
- Honey !
- Dad ?

480
00:23:54,197 --> 00:23:55,583
Get Dr. Hahn.

481
00:23:56,417 --> 00:23:57,543
I... I can't...

482
00:23:57,735 --> 00:23:59,571
Dad, dad, don't try to talk.

483
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:01,353
He's having a heart attack, Georgie !

484
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:02,101
Why don't you pump his chest ?

485
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:02,101
Pump his chest?

486
00:24:02,115 --> 00:24:03,710
Get the paddles !
They always use the paddles !

487
00:24:03,755 --> 00:24:04,851
He's not having a heart attack.

488
00:24:05,037 --> 00:24:06,341
Dad. Dad, stop !

489
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:08,593
I'm trying to help.
Your heart's going too fast.

490
00:24:08,638 --> 00:24:10,202
Recycle his B.P.

491
00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:13,713
Uh, pull, uh, verapamil, 5 milligrams.

492
00:24:14,025 --> 00:24:14,740
Dad. Dad !

493
00:24:14,838 --> 00:24:15,902
Stop fighting the mask.

494
00:24:15,905 --> 00:24:16,841
O'Malley, what's going on ?

495
00:24:17,315 --> 00:24:20,103
- You should've paged Hahn.
- I paged anyone from cardiothoracics.

496
00:24:20,138 --> 00:24:23,310
He's got a-fib with rapid ventricle
response. I've ordered verapamil.

497
00:24:23,498 --> 00:24:27,243
He's in v-tach. The verapamil is gonna
cause more problems than it solves.

498
00:24:27,315 --> 00:24:28,182
100 lidocaine.

499
00:24:28,348 --> 00:24:30,000
Uh, put on his 0-2 mask.

500
00:24:43,105 --> 00:24:44,733
All right, what happened ?

501
00:24:44,825 --> 00:24:48,100
He went into v-tach. O'Malley
is giving him lidocaine.

502
00:24:48,497 --> 00:24:52,623
- It's already put him back in normal sinus.
- All right, I need everyone out of here.

503
00:25:09,295 --> 00:25:12,233
- I got your page.
- I need another cappuccino.

504
00:25:12,775 --> 00:25:14,810
Did you think I was kidding before ?

505
00:25:15,277 --> 00:25:19,202
I am your attending, and if you want in
on my surgeries,

506
00:25:19,277 --> 00:25:23,711
you're gonna learn how to fetch
and stay and heel.

507
00:25:25,736 --> 00:25:27,031
Fine.

508
00:25:27,828 --> 00:25:30,531
- Don't fetch angry.
- If you think this means I respect you,

509
00:25:30,647 --> 00:25:34,842
if you want me to respect you, you have
to do something worth respecting.

510
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:44,043
all of these cables of nerves... ah...
I can't do this surgery, Miranda.

511
00:25:46,815 --> 00:25:50,840
I started to think I shouldn't be
operating after the Duquette M&M.

512
00:25:51,098 --> 00:25:53,590
All the whispers and the talk...

513
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,853
- I let that in.
- Mm.

514
00:25:56,607 --> 00:25:59,863
I started to question myself.

515
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:05,301
I believed it when I was told, uh,
I was no longer of use in the O.R.

516
00:26:05,776 --> 00:26:08,133
Oh, so when you said you wanted justice,
you were talking about...

517
00:26:08,165 --> 00:26:09,172
I'm a surgeon.

518
00:26:09,457 --> 00:26:11,192
There are lives in my hands.

519
00:26:11,397 --> 00:26:12,981
To make me question that...

520
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:19,133
No, that's to put a life at stake
every time I hold a scalpel.

521
00:26:25,755 --> 00:26:27,821
Well, I told Burke I could fix his hand,
and then...

522
00:26:28,537 --> 00:26:29,351
Well, you did.

523
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:29,852
Yeah.

524
00:26:29,927 --> 00:26:33,751
He is not paralyzed or...
Or disabled in any way.

525
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:34,601
He has a tremor.

526
00:26:34,967 --> 00:26:36,570
And if he had been honest about that,

527
00:26:37,898 --> 00:26:40,252
well, there's no telling what you could
have done to prevent it.

528
00:26:40,477 --> 00:26:41,493
Mm-hmm.

529
00:26:41,805 --> 00:26:43,131
We can do this.

530
00:26:46,927 --> 00:26:49,773
Hold on to my wedding ring,
honey. Hospital rules.

531
00:26:51,537 --> 00:26:53,640
Georgie, are you gonna
be there in the operation ?

532
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,411
They don't allow family in,
but you'll be fine.

533
00:26:56,986 --> 00:26:57,712
I'll be fine.

534
00:26:57,795 --> 00:26:59,012
We'll take good care of you.

535
00:27:06,237 --> 00:27:07,351
What am I gonna do ?

536
00:27:08,247 --> 00:27:09,923
What am I gonna do if he dies ?

537
00:27:17,316 --> 00:27:18,950
- I changed my mind.
- Oh, no, you didn't.

538
00:27:19,656 --> 00:27:22,523
Dr. Bailey, I'd like to be excused from
the twins if that's all right with you.

539
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,661
I'd like to be with my mom.

540
00:27:23,718 --> 00:27:25,403
That's the right call, O'Malley. Go.

541
00:27:27,365 --> 00:27:28,483
Promise me something...

542
00:27:29,006 --> 00:27:32,120
when you separate us, can you make
sure his ass is bigger than mine ?

543
00:27:33,397 --> 00:27:34,700
I can hear you.

544
00:27:37,297 --> 00:27:39,971
You're still here. I went to N.I.C.U.
I thought you'd be done.

545
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:43,302
I'm having trouble with this anastomosis,
and I still have to take a look
at the distal bowel.

546
00:27:43,476 --> 00:27:45,440
- What should I tell Molly ?
- I don't know.

547
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:47,993
Tell her I'm doing the best I can.

548
00:27:48,347 --> 00:27:48,991
I don't know.

549
00:27:53,598 --> 00:27:54,392
Dr. Bailey,

550
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:57,881
I'd like my intern to observe
from a better vantage point.

551
00:27:58,508 --> 00:27:59,950
Dr. Stevens ?

552
00:28:00,015 --> 00:28:00,760
Yes.

553
00:28:00,838 --> 00:28:05,501
She's my intern today, and I'd like her
nearby during surgery, not up in the
gallery, if that's okay with you.

554
00:28:06,015 --> 00:28:07,371
No problem.

555
00:28:07,495 --> 00:28:11,161
Dr. Bailey, Stevens is without privileges.

556
00:28:11,218 --> 00:28:12,360
Oh, 'cause she messed up ?

557
00:28:13,055 --> 00:28:16,541
Dr. Yang messed up, and she's
over in O.R. Two right now.

558
00:28:18,598 --> 00:28:19,482
Will you hit that for me ?

559
00:28:20,808 --> 00:28:21,370
Stevens,

560
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:23,863
I take it you remember how to scrub in.

561
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,022
Come on.

562
00:28:28,237 --> 00:28:31,291
This vessel's even more fragile
than in the biomodel.

563
00:28:32,097 --> 00:28:34,122
Let's do a microvascular bypass graft.

564
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:36,310
I could harvest the saphenous
vein while I'm down here.

565
00:28:36,035 --> 00:28:37,403
I don't know. I don't know
if that's a good idea.

566
00:28:37,575 --> 00:28:38,121
Gentlemen,

567
00:28:38,607 --> 00:28:40,923
we need to make a decision,
and we need to make it now.

568
00:28:42,228 --> 00:28:44,230
Derek, it's your call.

569
00:28:45,665 --> 00:28:47,840
Do you or don't you want to proceed ?

570
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:03,861
- Give me a 10-blade.
- Let's get some suction in here, please.

571
00:29:10,956 --> 00:29:12,460
I'm not supposed to be here.

572
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:14,961
Me either.

573
00:29:17,025 --> 00:29:18,363
- How's it going ?
- They just started.

574
00:29:23,786 --> 00:29:27,043
Allright, the skin incision
is done. Let's go.

575
00:29:39,647 --> 00:29:42,630
she's... Through the sternum.

576
00:29:43,957 --> 00:29:47,991
There's a bit of bleeding.
She's stopping it with bone wax.

577
00:29:48,845 --> 00:29:50,951
Inserting the retractor...

578
00:29:51,817 --> 00:29:54,082
she's opening the pericardial sac.

579
00:29:55,646 --> 00:29:59,741
Taking a look at the echo,
she's nodding.

580
00:30:00,415 --> 00:30:01,873
Looks good.

581
00:30:04,577 --> 00:30:10,192
They're looking at your dad's heart now.
She's preparing to put in the stay sutures.

582
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:27,690
- Is the saphenous vein graft in place ?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready.

583
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:28,773
Dr. Bailey?

584
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:29,910
- I'm good.
- Chief ?

585
00:30:30,087 --> 00:30:30,743
Ready when you are.

586
00:30:31,446 --> 00:30:32,103
All right,

587
00:30:32,256 --> 00:30:33,180
the moment of truth.

588
00:30:35,355 --> 00:30:36,241
Removing the clamps.

589
00:30:37,577 --> 00:30:40,081
Dr. Bailey check the nerve stimulator.

590
00:30:42,136 --> 00:30:43,773
S.S.E.P. are falling.

591
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:47,221
All right, pump up the blood pressure.
We need as much blood through
the area as possible.

592
00:30:47,897 --> 00:30:49,503
I'm going up to 2 milliamps.

593
00:30:51,027 --> 00:30:51,991
Up to 3.

594
00:30:53,327 --> 00:30:55,100
wait a minute. Uh, I see something.

595
00:30:55,366 --> 00:30:57,310
A flicker on the hamstring of twin "A."

596
00:30:57,386 --> 00:30:58,853
Anything on twin "b"?

597
00:30:59,228 --> 00:30:59,763
Pump it up some more.

598
00:31:00,248 --> 00:31:01,250
Okay, up to 4.

599
00:31:02,997 --> 00:31:05,282
A twitch. I got a twitch
on twin b's gastroc.

600
00:31:05,427 --> 00:31:06,563
Yeah, it's small, but it's there.

601
00:31:08,128 --> 00:31:09,130
We have a signal.

602
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:12,261
Congratulations, ladies and gentlem.
We have four functioning legs.

603
00:31:17,997 --> 00:31:18,872
Good job, everybody.

604
00:31:22,397 --> 00:31:24,551
Ladies and gentlemen, on three.

605
00:31:26,078 --> 00:31:26,853
One...

606
00:31:29,466 --> 00:31:30,320
Two...

607
00:31:32,295 --> 00:31:33,182
Three.

608
00:31:43,448 --> 00:31:46,090
It'd be nice if every love triangle
could be fixed with a scalpel.

609
00:31:46,136 --> 00:31:49,382
If they could, you'd have stabbed me
with a 10-blade a long time ago.

610
00:31:57,066 --> 00:31:57,882
How is she ?

611
00:31:58,177 --> 00:31:59,452
Please tell me good news

612
00:31:58,178 --> 00:31:59,713
Please tell me good news
because I have to go in
and tell molly,
and I don't want to tell her
anything bad.

613
00:31:59,535 --> 00:32:02,892
because I have to go in and tell Molly,
and I don't want to tell her anything bad.

614
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:04,510
Dr. Montmery is on her way,

615
00:32:04,545 --> 00:32:07,870
and she will explain everything.
But the baby...

616
00:32:08,276 --> 00:32:10,201
Laura. Molly named her Laura.

617
00:32:10,527 --> 00:32:15,013
Oh, Laura... Will need some recovery time,
but she should be just fine.

618
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,122
Oh, thank you.

619
00:32:18,278 --> 00:32:19,741
Oh, I was so scared.

620
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:22,392
Oh, thank you. Oh, God.

621
00:32:22,535 --> 00:32:25,283
She's gonna be so happy to hear this.

622
00:32:25,418 --> 00:32:27,631
Hey, this is your niece you know ?

623
00:32:29,998 --> 00:32:30,751
I'm sorry.

624
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:36,483
You're very nice. You both seem...
so nice.

625
00:32:38,836 --> 00:32:41,330
But I don't know you.

626
00:32:43,447 --> 00:32:46,083
And you are not my family.

627
00:32:57,657 --> 00:33:00,281
I'm closing the aortotomy.
What's next ?

628
00:33:00,526 --> 00:33:05,542
Place the needle in the ascending aorta
to remove air and then release
the aortic valve clamp.

629
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:09,293
You remind me of myself
when I was an intern.

630
00:33:10,416 --> 00:33:10,962
I do ?

631
00:33:11,338 --> 00:33:12,780
Focused, intense...

632
00:33:13,338 --> 00:33:14,042
cold...

633
00:33:14,268 --> 00:33:16,700
and I don't mean that as a bad thing.
Cold is good.

634
00:33:17,388 --> 00:33:21,222
The dating, the friends, the family...
If you ask me, it's all overrated.

635
00:33:22,826 --> 00:33:24,902
all right, tubes are out.

636
00:33:25,656 --> 00:33:28,463
Oh, the ascending aorta
is looking dilated.

637
00:33:28,986 --> 00:33:31,711
There's too much bleeding
around the aortic suture line.

638
00:33:31,758 --> 00:33:33,251
B.P. Is 68 over 42.

639
00:33:34,605 --> 00:33:35,481
God...

640
00:33:36,276 --> 00:33:37,303
he's bradying down.

641
00:33:37,386 --> 00:33:40,773
Get me another T.E.E.
And an echocardiogram, stat.

642
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,662
Let's move it, people.
This doesn't look good.

643
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:52,081
We gotta get control of this bleeding.

644
00:33:52,308 --> 00:33:54,081
All right, let's get him back on bypass.

645
00:33:54,107 --> 00:33:56,312
I could put the aortic cannula
into his right atrium.

646
00:33:56,337 --> 00:33:58,133
- By yourself ?
- Yes.

647
00:33:59,235 --> 00:34:00,112
All right, do it.

648
00:34:03,368 --> 00:34:05,682
Replace it with a 2-stage
venous cannula.

649
00:34:08,725 --> 00:34:09,681
Why is she doing that ?

650
00:34:09,835 --> 00:34:12,270
- Wh-why is Hahn letting her do that ?
- No, it's okay.

651
00:34:12,587 --> 00:34:15,633
She's doing a running whip stitch.
She's done it before.

652
00:34:18,386 --> 00:34:19,783
There you go.

653
00:34:23,915 --> 00:34:27,393
Ah that's beautiful work, Dr. Yang.

654
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:33,963
Dr. Hahn's work was impeccable, O'Malley.

655
00:34:34,585 --> 00:34:36,530
I wouldn't have done
anything different myself.

656
00:34:37,255 --> 00:34:38,091
It's just, uh...

657
00:34:40,265 --> 00:34:42,972
You can never tell how the body
is going to respond.

658
00:34:45,206 --> 00:34:46,482
Every surgery...

659
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:50,043
Every body is different.

660
00:34:51,995 --> 00:34:55,770
You just...
never know.

661
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,431
But it's okay now.

662
00:35:01,107 --> 00:35:02,663
They're in the home stretch.

663
00:35:07,335 --> 00:35:08,531
Thank you, Dr. Burke.

664
00:35:17,398 --> 00:35:22,731
It undermines everything for my interns
to see Yang go without punishment,

665
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:26,793
For me to see Burke
go without punishment.

666
00:35:27,568 --> 00:35:28,761
Take a step back.

667
00:35:29,675 --> 00:35:31,583
Try and get some perspective.

668
00:35:31,657 --> 00:35:34,740
So there will be no consequences,
for either of them.

669
00:35:34,887 --> 00:35:35,902
What would you have me do,

670
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:37,941
Fire the both of them,

671
00:35:38,546 --> 00:35:39,750
End their careers ?

672
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:42,032
They made a terrible judgment call.

673
00:35:42,326 --> 00:35:45,420
- Which is what happened with Denny Duquette.
- And they didn't kill anybody.

674
00:35:46,037 --> 00:35:49,862
- And I did.
- You didn't kill Duquette, and I won't
have you saying you did.

675
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,463
I was responsiblefor Izzie Stevens.

676
00:35:52,475 --> 00:35:53,621
I was responsible.

677
00:35:53,798 --> 00:35:55,662
And I'm responsible for Cristina Yang.

678
00:35:56,316 --> 00:35:57,012
I...

679
00:35:58,596 --> 00:36:00,760
am the common thread here.

680
00:36:01,016 --> 00:36:01,761
I...

681
00:36:03,205 --> 00:36:05,843
lost them. Cristina, Izzie...

682
00:36:06,025 --> 00:36:08,042
Are not the same.

683
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:10,293
Miranda...

684
00:36:11,896 --> 00:36:17,960
You raise them... You raise them like...
Like children...

685
00:36:18,996 --> 00:36:22,723
And some of them make mistakes
and some of them disappoint you.

686
00:36:22,836 --> 00:36:24,150
Some of them...

687
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:31,422
Do you know what kind of strength
it must have taken Yang to come to me,

688
00:36:31,978 --> 00:36:35,490
to report on an attending,
on her boyfriend ?

689
00:36:37,107 --> 00:36:40,521
Do you see how much she's grown?

690
00:36:43,778 --> 00:36:47,960
You raise them...
like children...

691
00:36:50,186 --> 00:36:54,793
and some of them turn out
exactly like you, Dr. Bailey.

692
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:01,111
Finally alone.

693
00:37:02,366 --> 00:37:03,422
Yeah.

694
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:06,662
Pete ?

695
00:37:12,866 --> 00:37:14,760
It's been a long day.

696
00:37:17,287 --> 00:37:18,331
Okay.

697
00:37:20,978 --> 00:37:27,560
Well, you get a good night's sleep,
and, uh, I'll, um, come back in the morning.

698
00:37:34,075 --> 00:37:35,601
At the end of the day,

699
00:37:35,956 --> 00:37:37,810
when it comes down to it,

700
00:37:38,565 --> 00:37:40,133
all we really want

701
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:43,142
is to be close to somebody...

702
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,461
couldn't stay away ?

703
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:13,670
So this thing where we all
keep our distance

704
00:38:13,846 --> 00:38:16,540
and pretend not to care
about each other...

705
00:38:17,437 --> 00:38:19,423
It's usually a lot of bull.

706
00:38:19,705 --> 00:38:21,133
Did you want to come in ?

707
00:38:21,337 --> 00:38:23,492
No. Uh, I just, uh...

708
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:25,492
She's okay ?

709
00:38:25,898 --> 00:38:27,622
She's beautiful.

710
00:38:31,127 --> 00:38:33,621
We could be your family

711
00:38:34,088 --> 00:38:34,960
if you want us.

712
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:37,441
You have a mother, I know.

713
00:38:37,646 --> 00:38:42,051
I'm not saying... I'm just saying that
we could be your family, too.

714
00:38:50,445 --> 00:38:55,172
So we pick and choose
who we want to remain close to.

715
00:39:01,018 --> 00:39:02,641
I can't take this anymore.

716
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:03,340
What ?

717
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,653
Let her off the hook. Let Cristina off
the freakin'hook.

718
00:39:06,865 --> 00:39:09,482
- Meredith...
- Izzie, you cut the lvad wire.

719
00:39:09,615 --> 00:39:11,651
She stuck by you and did Denny's echo.

720
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:15,402
You cheated on Izzie with syph nurse,
and she helped you study for your boards.

721
00:39:15,548 --> 00:39:18,070
And, George, when everybody
was calling you 007

722
00:39:18,095 --> 00:39:19,530
She was calling me 007.

723
00:39:28,997 --> 00:39:32,112
Just let her off the hook.

724
00:39:38,395 --> 00:39:40,013
It's okay.

725
00:39:43,077 --> 00:39:44,043
Sorry.

726
00:39:51,435 --> 00:39:55,782
Why can't you mind your own business ?
You know, what is your problem ?

727
00:39:56,335 --> 00:40:00,322
You're my sister. You're my family.
You're all I've got.

728
00:40:01,865 --> 00:40:04,221
And once we've chosen those people...

729
00:40:05,385 --> 00:40:06,671
I'm so tired.

730
00:40:08,996 --> 00:40:10,280
I know. Me, too.

731
00:40:10,878 --> 00:40:12,910
We tend to stick close by...

732
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:20,980
Uh, I was... I just... I wanted to check
on your dad and see how he was doing.

733
00:40:21,016 --> 00:40:22,852
Good. He's resting, but he's good.

734
00:40:26,207 --> 00:40:26,641
Okay.

735
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:28,851
Okay.

736
00:40:32,607 --> 00:40:34,321
No matter how much we hurt them.

737
00:40:38,215 --> 00:40:39,443
- Hey.
- Hi there.

738
00:40:41,995 --> 00:40:44,342
I'm gonna go back upstairs
with dr. Burke.

739
00:40:44,488 --> 00:40:45,952
He wants me to take
a look at his shoulder.

740
00:40:46,037 --> 00:40:47,700
I'm gonna be a while.
Don't wait up, okay ?

741
00:40:48,468 --> 00:40:49,000
Okay.

742
00:40:49,748 --> 00:40:52,723
The people that are still with you
at the end of the day...

743
00:40:55,315 --> 00:40:58,703
those are the ones worth keeping.

744
00:41:01,895 --> 00:41:05,010
And sure, sometimes close
can be too close...

745
00:41:05,057 --> 00:41:07,331
I couldn't stay with that man.
I don't care that he...

746
00:41:07,416 --> 00:41:09,661
that he's Meredith's father,
I. I just couldn't take it,

747
00:41:09,687 --> 00:41:10,563
and then Richard...

748
00:41:10,817 --> 00:41:11,210
and he...

749
00:41:12,046 --> 00:41:13,721
and he...

750
00:41:20,798 --> 00:41:21,870
No...

751
00:41:34,928 --> 00:41:37,042
Meredith.

752
00:41:40,037 --> 00:41:41,323
Mommy ?

753
00:41:50,085 --> 00:41:53,920
But sometimes that invasion
of personal space...

754
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:58,833
It can be exactly what you need.

755
00:42:00,368 --> 00:42:06,300
