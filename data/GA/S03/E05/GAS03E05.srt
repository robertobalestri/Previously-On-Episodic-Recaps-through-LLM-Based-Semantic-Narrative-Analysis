1
00:00:00,188 --> 00:00:01,753
Previously, on
"Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,783 --> 00:00:04,247
She cut his LVAD wire.

3
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:07,134
Denny Duquette died
at 7:42 this evening.

4
00:00:07,226 --> 00:00:09,677
I had a baby and I went soft.

5
00:00:09,791 --> 00:00:12,741
Your hand is fine,
and Shepherd will clear you for surgery.

6
00:00:13,006 --> 00:00:15,370
- Our marriage is over.
- Yeah, I guess it is.

7
00:00:15,445 --> 00:00:17,864
Who am I to you, George?
Am I your girlfriend?

8
00:00:17,979 --> 00:00:19,406
Am I somebody you
mess around with?

9
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,625
Can I buy you a drink, Callie?

10
00:00:20,655 --> 00:00:22,570
Only if you have it
delivered to my hotel room,

11
00:00:22,602 --> 00:00:23,608
because I'm off to bed.

12
00:00:23,631 --> 00:00:26,504
- You are a great guy.
- So it's Derek.

13
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:28,803
He's gonna hurt you again.
I'm walkin' away.

14
00:00:28,936 --> 00:00:30,723
It's for you. It's from Denny.

15
00:00:36,275 --> 00:00:38,111
<i>First do no harm--</i>

16
00:00:38,727 --> 00:00:41,591
<i>As doctors,
we pledge to live by this oath.</i>

17
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:46,062
<i>But harm happens...
and then guilt happens.</i>

18
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,790
<i>And there's no oath for
how to deal with that.</i>

19
00:00:49,187 --> 00:00:49,932
Morning.

20
00:00:50,046 --> 00:00:52,593
I thought we were done with
the whole muffin thing.

21
00:00:52,596 --> 00:00:55,010
This isn't muffins.
This is breakfast.

22
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:57,463
Mer needs a good,
solid breakfast.

23
00:00:57,737 --> 00:00:59,841
First day back after
the big surgery.

24
00:00:59,956 --> 00:01:00,910
Are you okay?

25
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:02,283
Of course I'm okay.

26
00:01:02,465 --> 00:01:04,221
I'm a millionaire. Fruit?

27
00:01:05,705 --> 00:01:07,402
What do you guys
think about B&Bs?

28
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,392
I'm thinking about
opening a B&B in Vermont

29
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:10,891
where the foliage is, you know?

30
00:01:10,926 --> 00:01:12,313
Maybe you should
go back to bed.

31
00:01:12,348 --> 00:01:14,321
Can't. I'm going
to the hospital.

32
00:01:14,428 --> 00:01:15,631
Are you gonna go
talk to the chief?

33
00:01:15,665 --> 00:01:17,941
Nope. Going to
clean out my locker.

34
00:01:18,377 --> 00:01:21,171
I could buy a hotel.
How much do you think a hotel costs?

35
00:01:22,297 --> 00:01:23,330
- Izzie
- Is that...

36
00:01:24,175 --> 00:01:25,541
That is $8 million.

37
00:01:26,327 --> 00:01:28,583
$8 million does not like to
have juice spilled on it.

38
00:01:28,617 --> 00:01:30,091
You have to take that
to the bank today.

39
00:01:30,127 --> 00:01:31,691
It's making me
nervous in the house.

40
00:01:31,727 --> 00:01:33,830
I will,
as soon as I clean out my locker.

41
00:01:35,736 --> 00:01:36,811
I am fine.

42
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:38,712
Really, I am fine.

43
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:40,550
Denny loved me.

44
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:42,390
He wanted me to
have this money.

45
00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:43,712
He wants me to be happy.

46
00:01:44,318 --> 00:01:45,413
So I'm happy.

47
00:01:46,017 --> 00:01:46,992
Juice?

48
00:01:50,598 --> 00:01:51,772
She's losing it.

49
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:55,781
She almost battered and deep fried an
$8 1/2-million check this morning.

50
00:01:56,127 --> 00:01:58,403
That kind of money,
I'd buy my own hospital

51
00:01:58,496 --> 00:02:00,141
and stock it full
of sick people.

52
00:02:00,326 --> 00:02:03,613
Valvuloplasties and
ruptured aneurysms... mm.

53
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,861
You're a psycho.
You know that, right?

54
00:02:05,897 --> 00:02:08,893
I'm not the one with an $8
1/2-million check I won't cash.

55
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:11,783
Stop talking about me.
I'm fine.

56
00:02:12,335 --> 00:02:14,811
I am cleaning out my locker
and I am going home.

57
00:02:15,325 --> 00:02:17,241
Mer is the one
with the problems.

58
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:19,833
What's wrong with me?

59
00:02:20,698 --> 00:02:23,251
Well, now you haven't told
McDreamy that you dumped McVet.

60
00:02:23,288 --> 00:02:24,573
Oh, you haven't done that yet?

61
00:02:24,606 --> 00:02:25,613
Dude, tell him already.

62
00:02:25,648 --> 00:02:27,961
- She's scared.
- I am not scared.

63
00:02:28,076 --> 00:02:30,242
Derek walked away.
He walked away.

64
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,562
And maybe that's a good thing.

65
00:02:31,595 --> 00:02:32,941
I mean, maybe he's happier.

66
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,031
Maybe he's moved on.

67
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,070
He's got Addison here,
he's got Mark here.

68
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:37,951
He's... got a lot to deal with.

69
00:02:38,146 --> 00:02:39,641
And I'm not gonna
make him feel guilty.

70
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:41,770
I mean,
I am being an adult here.

71
00:02:41,906 --> 00:02:44,300
And I am not going to drag
him into our whole...

72
00:02:46,338 --> 00:02:48,602
Izzie is the one
with the big check.

73
00:02:49,478 --> 00:02:50,453
I'm fine.

74
00:02:50,857 --> 00:02:53,832
Guilt never goes
anywhere on its own.

75
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:57,422
It brings its friends
doubt and insecurity.

76
00:03:01,487 --> 00:03:02,930
Is that your boyfriend again?

77
00:03:03,055 --> 00:03:04,763
I do not have a boyfriend.

78
00:03:05,326 --> 00:03:06,753
Then why the guilty face?

79
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:09,472
You were sexier when
you weren't talking.

80
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:12,261
Am I keeping you, O'Malley?

81
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,703
M&M in 15 minutes, people.

82
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:18,733
Wait,  wait, wait.
We get to go to M&M?

83
00:03:18,736 --> 00:03:19,970
Even if we haven't
finished our rounds?

84
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:22,530
Even if.
I want all of you to the M&M today.

85
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:23,712
Yes!

86
00:03:24,808 --> 00:03:27,232
People die in this
hospital on our watch.

87
00:03:27,455 --> 00:03:29,852
Once a month,
we meet to discuss how our actions

88
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:32,082
as physicians contributed
to the deaths.

89
00:03:32,297 --> 00:03:33,922
This is a serious exercise.

90
00:03:34,025 --> 00:03:35,001
Dr. Bailey.

91
00:03:37,248 --> 00:03:38,601
George, Alex,
you guys get good seats,

92
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:39,932
Mer and I will get snacks.

93
00:03:40,077 --> 00:03:41,421
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Niles.

94
00:03:41,627 --> 00:03:43,270
We kinda got turned around
on our way to admitting.

95
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,402
Oh, oh, not a problem.

96
00:03:44,507 --> 00:03:48,943
Dr. Karev, uh, Mrs. Niles is
scheduled for a mastectomy tomorrow.

97
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:51,602
Uh, why don't you show her and
her husband up to the fifth floor?

98
00:03:51,637 --> 00:03:53,120
Is this the little man?

99
00:03:53,777 --> 00:03:55,292
He is adorable.

100
00:03:55,418 --> 00:03:56,800
He's not so adorable
at 4:00 in the morning

101
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,453
when he's screaming and
won't take a bottle.

102
00:03:58,485 --> 00:03:59,883
Can we just get to the room?

103
00:04:00,348 --> 00:04:01,891
It's been kind of a rough week.

104
00:04:02,038 --> 00:04:04,021
She had to stop nursing.
Gus here just won't eat.

105
00:04:04,058 --> 00:04:05,773
Here. Why don't I take you up?

106
00:04:06,488 --> 00:04:07,380
There you go.

107
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:10,932
You know, you can try a little
sugar water on the bottle,

108
00:04:11,048 --> 00:04:13,240
just until he gets used to it.

109
00:04:15,448 --> 00:04:17,191
Does that woman
have breast cancer?

110
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:18,762
What is she, 30 years old?

111
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:19,802
It's a new baby.

112
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,070
Probably thought the
lump was a milk duct.

113
00:04:23,685 --> 00:04:25,473
You learn things on
the vagina squad.

114
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:26,673
Okay, yeah, focus, people.

115
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:29,903
M&M--insults flying,
residents covering their asses,

116
00:04:30,118 --> 00:04:32,760
our bosses getting kicked
in the teeth instead of us.

117
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:34,472
Seats, then snacks.

118
00:04:36,997 --> 00:04:39,470
Hey. I didn't know you
were coming to the M&M.

119
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:41,273
You brought snacks?

120
00:04:41,435 --> 00:04:43,100
Well... yeah.

121
00:04:45,436 --> 00:04:47,110
- You okay?
- Fine.

122
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:49,083
Hey, no surgeries today, right?

123
00:04:49,218 --> 00:04:51,112
I mean, I'm ready if you need me.
- No.

124
00:04:52,498 --> 00:04:53,672
No surgeries.

125
00:05:01,338 --> 00:05:03,631
Callie. Hey.

126
00:05:04,175 --> 00:05:07,033
Hi. Did you get my message--
my messages?

127
00:05:07,277 --> 00:05:08,522
Yeah. I gotta get a seat.

128
00:05:08,627 --> 00:05:11,271
Alex  is saving us a bunch
if you want to sit with us.

129
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:22,743
She's trying to make me feel
guilty about the other night,

130
00:05:22,775 --> 00:05:23,960
about the Izzie thing.

131
00:05:24,818 --> 00:05:27,811
- I thought you said you apologized already?
- I did. I have.

132
00:05:28,297 --> 00:05:31,460
I'm done.
I-I am not apologizing anymore.

133
00:05:32,137 --> 00:05:34,433
I'm enjoying life.
I'm loving the M&M.

134
00:05:34,865 --> 00:05:36,891
Okay, people, let's begin.

135
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:42,910
Patient 34986 died last month from
complications following a
heart transplant.

136
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:44,843
Dr. Burke will present.

137
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:53,823
- You guys... isn't patient 34986...
- Denny.

138
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:55,103
$8 million...

139
00:05:55,645 --> 00:06:00,000
$8 million could get us on a
plane to somewhere far, far away.

140
00:06:26,927 --> 00:06:28,921
Cause of death at
autopsy was an embolus

141
00:06:29,008 --> 00:06:31,651
that dislodged from the
suture line of the transplant

142
00:06:31,865 --> 00:06:34,360
and caused a C.V.A.
with brain stem herniation.

143
00:06:34,457 --> 00:06:35,262
Dr. Burke?

144
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,748
So the company line is
that he died of a C.V.A.?

145
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:41,294
There's no company line.
That's what he died of.

146
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:43,763
Uh, yes,
let's get back to this, uh,

147
00:06:43,935 --> 00:06:46,140
patient's need for an
emergent transplant.

148
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:51,940
You're saying that his left ventricle
had been weakened by the
LVAD malfunction?

149
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:56,013
His left ventricle was weakened by the fact
that he suffered from congestive heart failure.

150
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,672
Oh, come on, Dr. Burke.

151
00:06:58,195 --> 00:07:00,853
We all know the LVAD
was cut by an intern.

152
00:07:01,358 --> 00:07:02,953
Oh, I'm going to
my happy place.

153
00:07:02,985 --> 00:07:04,642
The exact chain of
events remain unclear.

154
00:07:04,678 --> 00:07:08,370
It remains unclear to you because you're
in the E.R. with a gunshot wound.

155
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:10,773
Why aren't we hearing
from Dr. Bailey?

156
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:12,662
She was the senior
physician on the case.

157
00:07:12,697 --> 00:07:14,182
I am the attending on record.

158
00:07:14,378 --> 00:07:17,942
Yes... I was the
resident in charge.

159
00:07:28,706 --> 00:07:32,563
Dr. Burke has summarized the
medical facts of this case.

160
00:07:32,795 --> 00:07:34,520
Are there any questions for me?

161
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:40,932
Grey's Anatomy - Saison 3 Episod 5
"Oh, The Guilt"

162
00:07:42,186 --> 00:07:44,890
You recently had a baby,
Dr. Bailey?

163
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:47,363
I don't see what that
has to do with--

164
00:07:47,395 --> 00:07:49,941
Sleep deprivation coupled with
wild swings in hormone levels

165
00:07:49,977 --> 00:07:52,321
are factors that could
cloud anyone's judgment.

166
00:07:52,768 --> 00:07:54,790
I sleep just fine, Dr. Savoy.

167
00:07:54,965 --> 00:07:58,231
Really? 'Cause if a patient died
due to my poor decision making,

168
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,841
I'd probably lose at least
a little sleep or it.

169
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:04,791
Let me remind everyone that our
purpose here is not to place blame.

170
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:09,381
This is a forum to discuss mistakes
in patient care and learn from them.

171
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:12,310
Well, so far, I haven't heard Dr.
Bailey admit to a mistake.

172
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:15,101
Why don't they just put a
bullet in the back of her head?

173
00:08:15,137 --> 00:08:16,591
It would be more humane.

174
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:18,371
So for a period
of several hours,

175
00:08:18,716 --> 00:08:22,172
your interns were running amok in
the hospital, totally unsupervised.

176
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,670
I'm waiting for a question.

177
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:26,720
The question is where were you?

178
00:08:27,956 --> 00:08:31,472
There was the shooting, and the E.R.
was chaotic.

179
00:08:31,588 --> 00:08:32,843
The E.R. is always chaotic.

180
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:34,411
Did you page them
during this time?

181
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:36,651
Yes, I paged them
multiple times.

182
00:08:36,797 --> 00:08:39,993
Well, apparently, they thought it
was okay to ignore your pages.

183
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:44,473
Doctor, why do you think your interns
have such contempt for your authority?

184
00:08:44,577 --> 00:08:46,623
You don't know what the
hell you're talking about!

185
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:47,990
Dr. Karev, sit down.

186
00:08:56,855 --> 00:08:57,701
I zzie.

187
00:09:03,826 --> 00:09:05,773
Next question.

188
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,983
Derek says that neither of you
brought any assets into the marriage.

189
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:14,011
Well, I had my trust fund and
a sparkling personality...

190
00:09:15,158 --> 00:09:16,290
And the futon couch.

191
00:09:16,445 --> 00:09:19,411
Yes, Addison had a very ugly,
very heavy futon couch.

192
00:09:19,536 --> 00:09:20,863
What ever happened
to that couch?

193
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:21,951
We gave it to Mark.

194
00:09:22,336 --> 00:09:24,193
- She can have him.
- I don't want him.

195
00:09:24,228 --> 00:09:25,751
Okay, well, that's settled.
What else?

196
00:09:25,787 --> 00:09:28,990
So aside from Addison's trust fund,
which remains in her name,

197
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:32,462
you'll split everything--
stocks, bonds, 401ks--down the middle.

198
00:09:32,766 --> 00:09:35,603
The only that gets a little
complicated is the real estate.

199
00:09:35,638 --> 00:09:37,553
Let me make this, uh, simple.

200
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:40,303
I'd like to keep my trailer
and the land in Seattle.

201
00:09:40,338 --> 00:09:41,712
Addison can have the rest.

202
00:09:41,898 --> 00:09:42,823
Hold on.

203
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:44,313
That's the house
in the hamptons

204
00:09:44,345 --> 00:09:45,930
and the brownstone
overlooking Central Park?

205
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:47,450
- That's very generous, Dr. Shepherd.
- Thank you.

206
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:50,263
- Hold on. He's up to something.
- No, I'm not.

207
00:09:50,408 --> 00:09:53,883
I came here to fight over cds and books,
go to war over a crystal vase.

208
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:54,993
What are you up to, Derek?

209
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:56,220
The divorce is my fault.

210
00:09:56,248 --> 00:09:58,360
- Let me take responsibility.
- We both had affairs.

211
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,190
You had a one-night
stand with Mark.

212
00:10:01,396 --> 00:10:02,820
Derek, actually...

213
00:10:03,308 --> 00:10:05,652
- well, it was--
- Oh, okay, it was two nights.

214
00:10:05,807 --> 00:10:06,911
You  made a mistake.

215
00:10:08,137 --> 00:10:10,033
Meredith and I,
we had a relationship.

216
00:10:10,386 --> 00:10:12,531
Make these changes,
and I'll sign it today.

217
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:18,110
You weren't supposed
to be in here, Izzie.

218
00:10:18,255 --> 00:10:19,860
You shouldn't have
had to see that.

219
00:10:19,897 --> 00:10:22,680
No, it's fine. I'm fine.

220
00:10:23,736 --> 00:10:26,600
Clearly the doctor thing
was not working for me.

221
00:10:27,606 --> 00:10:29,170
So go about your business.

222
00:10:29,385 --> 00:10:31,443
Run labs, cure cancer.
I'm fine.

223
00:10:31,808 --> 00:10:33,142
You're not going home.

224
00:10:33,988 --> 00:10:36,682
Either you hang out with us
or we'll call your mother.

225
00:10:37,856 --> 00:10:39,312
She's just a few hours away,

226
00:10:39,447 --> 00:10:42,840
and I'm sure she wouldn't mind coming
and staying with you, all day.

227
00:10:44,087 --> 00:10:45,641
- You wouldn't.
- Dialing.

228
00:10:48,217 --> 00:10:49,291
I'll just...

229
00:10:50,447 --> 00:10:52,142
go hang out in the locker room.

230
00:11:07,555 --> 00:11:10,672
What is she doing here?
She has no business in this room.

231
00:11:13,677 --> 00:11:15,222
What are you looking at me for?

232
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:17,520
I didn't have anything
to do with this.

233
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,010
I didn't have anything
to do with any of this.

234
00:11:21,038 --> 00:11:23,210
I'll stay with her today,
if that's okay.

235
00:11:23,387 --> 00:11:25,751
I'll update charts
and I'll run labs

236
00:11:25,927 --> 00:11:28,120
and just keep an eye on her,
if that's okay.

237
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:31,083
-  She shouldn't be alone.
- Fine.

238
00:11:33,517 --> 00:11:34,891
Dr. Bailey...

239
00:11:35,107 --> 00:11:36,661
- We just wanna say...
- We're really sorry...

240
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:40,833
- About the M&M.
- No, you do not get to apologize to me for this.

241
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:42,912
You do not get to feel better.

242
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:44,461
Neither do I.

243
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:49,120
Get to work.
O'Malley, just keep an eye on her.

244
00:11:49,298 --> 00:11:50,391
Yes, Dr. Bailey.

245
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:59,400
Dr. Bailey, you understand.
It's nothing personal.

246
00:12:00,305 --> 00:12:02,741
People talking about
your hormone levels

247
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:04,590
starts feeling pretty personal.

248
00:12:04,737 --> 00:12:07,501
Hey, Dr. Bailey.
Look, you're the baby whisperer.

249
00:12:07,628 --> 00:12:09,041
Gus here drank
the whole bottle.

250
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:10,322
Here, you want to hold him?

251
00:12:10,357 --> 00:12:12,640
Uh, actually now
isn't a good time.

252
00:12:12,747 --> 00:12:14,940
I'm about to go and
get your wife's labs.

253
00:12:15,075 --> 00:12:18,301
Oh, yeah. Uh...
do you, uh, think you could talk to her?

254
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:19,463
She's kind of freaking out.

255
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:20,841
She's not too sure
about the mastectomy.

256
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,571
She's thinking
maybe a lumpectomy.

257
00:12:22,848 --> 00:12:23,823
I know she likes you.

258
00:12:23,857 --> 00:12:24,952
Maybe you could talk her into--

259
00:12:24,985 --> 00:12:27,833
Oh, no, no. It's not my job
to talk her into anything.

260
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:31,163
Maybe if she knew more about
her reconstructive options...

261
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,623
um, I'll send our
plastic surgeon up.

262
00:12:44,505 --> 00:12:45,463
Hey, chief.

263
00:12:45,755 --> 00:12:47,433
- You got a minute?
- Sure.

264
00:12:49,155 --> 00:12:51,623
- That was quiet a morning, huh?
- It was.

265
00:12:51,865 --> 00:12:53,361
It's always good to be reminded

266
00:12:53,396 --> 00:12:55,893
how important it is to be
at the top of your game.

267
00:12:55,948 --> 00:12:57,561
That's actually what I
wanted to talk to you about.

268
00:12:57,598 --> 00:12:59,742
I am so glad you are
back in this building.

269
00:12:59,786 --> 00:13:01,883
I need your help
focusing the staff.

270
00:13:02,018 --> 00:13:04,161
They respond to you as
an authority figure.

271
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:06,782
I mean, you're an example
of what they should be--

272
00:13:06,896 --> 00:13:07,942
a leader.

273
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:10,512
I'm glad to have
you back, Preston.

274
00:13:11,397 --> 00:13:12,481
Thank you, chief.

275
00:13:21,328 --> 00:13:22,412
You're back.

276
00:13:23,446 --> 00:13:24,481
I am.

277
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,720
You look, uh, good without an appendix.
It suits you.

278
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:31,043
- How are you?
- Fine.

279
00:13:32,947 --> 00:13:36,333
- How are you?
- I'm great.

280
00:13:36,455 --> 00:13:39,502
- Feeling well? No pain?
- No pain.

281
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,352
That's your wife.

282
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:47,192
I'm on her service.

283
00:13:47,358 --> 00:13:48,492
Oh. Okay, then.

284
00:13:49,856 --> 00:13:51,342
I won't stand in your way.

285
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:03,972
Hi. I was paged by
Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd.

286
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:07,201
- Dr. Grey. Welcome back.
- Thank you.

287
00:14:07,238 --> 00:14:10,313
- And, uh, it's just Montgomery now.
- What?

288
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:15,663
My name. The divorce was finalized
this morning. So... Montgomery.

289
00:14:17,035 --> 00:14:19,830
To add to our fun,
we've been asked to consult on a case

290
00:14:19,888 --> 00:14:22,972
where a woman has a foreign
object stuck inside of her.

291
00:14:23,218 --> 00:14:25,451
- Ah!
- Adam, ow!

292
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,362
It hurts whenever you move.

293
00:14:27,507 --> 00:14:29,643
Well, then keep your
weight off my bad knee.

294
00:14:29,676 --> 00:14:32,271
I'm sorry.
I thought it was on the left side.

295
00:14:32,516 --> 00:14:35,472
19 years of marriage,
you'd think you'd have that one down.

296
00:14:35,926 --> 00:14:38,793
It appears that her husband
is the foreign object.

297
00:14:38,938 --> 00:14:40,402
- Ex-husband.
- Ex-husband.

298
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,620
- You had to go and get a piercing.
- Sonja.

299
00:14:47,806 --> 00:14:50,650
What? It's not like they're
not going to find out.

300
00:14:50,835 --> 00:14:52,381
This is so embarrassing.

301
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:55,063
No. Embarrassing is meeting
your husband for lunch

302
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:57,681
with your ex-husband
still attached.

303
00:14:57,907 --> 00:14:59,413
How long is this gonna take?

304
00:14:59,536 --> 00:15:02,083
Because I really don't want
my husband finding out.

305
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:05,622
Please, could you work
out some small miracle?

306
00:15:05,776 --> 00:15:09,422
Well, first of all, we have to figure
out what the piercing is caught on.

307
00:15:10,226 --> 00:15:12,233
Do you have any piercings?

308
00:15:12,505 --> 00:15:14,420
- Me? No!
- Ow!

309
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:16,432
I'm sorry.

310
00:15:16,587 --> 00:15:17,941
I sell real estate.

311
00:15:18,056 --> 00:15:21,023
What is that supposed to mean?
I sell real estate, too.

312
00:15:21,566 --> 00:15:23,313
We've been divorced
for five years.

313
00:15:23,776 --> 00:15:25,680
But we keep running
into each other,

314
00:15:25,948 --> 00:15:28,081
you know, work stuff.

315
00:15:28,868 --> 00:15:31,870
We get together sometimes.
It's stupid and weak,

316
00:15:32,236 --> 00:15:34,862
and it is never
happening again.

317
00:15:35,026 --> 00:15:37,460
Okay, well, Dr.
Grey is going to check on the x-rays,

318
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:39,672
and then--then we'll take
it from there, okay?

319
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:43,431
But, um, you--you might want
to cancel your lunch plans.

320
00:15:48,788 --> 00:15:50,740
- That M&M was--
- Yeah.

321
00:15:53,705 --> 00:15:55,121
I went to tell the chief...

322
00:15:56,967 --> 00:15:58,493
about my hand.

323
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:06,243
- Oh. Burke, how--how did...
- But I couldn't. I...

324
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:10,041
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

325
00:16:10,988 --> 00:16:13,431
Well, I-I can be there if
you need me in surgery.

326
00:16:13,546 --> 00:16:15,241
I'm not going to
do any surgeries.

327
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:18,680
I'm gonna catch
up on paperwork.

328
00:16:19,308 --> 00:16:22,150
- Wait, so--so what does that mean? That--
- I don't know.

329
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:25,070
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

330
00:16:26,057 --> 00:16:27,781
I need time to think.

331
00:16:28,258 --> 00:16:31,563
I have... paperwork.

332
00:16:32,588 --> 00:16:34,372
I need to do paperwork.

333
00:16:37,177 --> 00:16:39,412
I know how the rumor mill works
around here, George, okay?

334
00:16:39,446 --> 00:16:42,570
I'm the crazy intern, and now I'm the
crazy intern whose friends have to babysit her.

335
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:44,733
You know what we should talk about is
what you're gonna do with all that money

336
00:16:44,765 --> 00:16:47,813
once you deposit the check after
we don't let you destroy it.

337
00:16:47,865 --> 00:16:50,383
- Don't move, Adam.
- Whoa! I'm not moving.

338
00:16:50,545 --> 00:16:51,941
Are those people having sex?

339
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:54,601
They were having sex.
Now they're just fighting.

340
00:16:54,938 --> 00:16:56,482
Good to have you back, Stevens.

341
00:16:56,668 --> 00:17:00,800
I'm not back.
I'm fine, just not back.

342
00:17:00,975 --> 00:17:03,780
Hey, you're Addison
Forbes Montgomery-Shepherd.

343
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:05,932
That's a lot of names,
a lot of rich sounding names.

344
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:07,290
You're rich, right?

345
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,943
Oh, that's rude. That's a rude question.
I'm sorry. It's just that,

346
00:17:10,977 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm rich now, too.

347
00:17:12,135 --> 00:17:13,761
You're not rich until
you deposit the check.

348
00:17:13,797 --> 00:17:14,990
Do you ever feel guilty?

349
00:17:15,036 --> 00:17:15,941
I'm sorry.

350
00:17:16,045 --> 00:17:18,723
Being rich.
'Cause I have all this money now,

351
00:17:18,835 --> 00:17:20,991
and I don't really feel like
I did anything to deserve it,

352
00:17:21,025 --> 00:17:23,683
and I can't really talk to my friends
about it... 'cause they're all so poor.

353
00:17:23,716 --> 00:17:25,060
Standing right here, Izzie.

354
00:17:27,348 --> 00:17:31,250
Deposit the check, Stevens.
Just start there, okay?

355
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:35,473
And, um,
the guilt will work itself out.

356
00:17:43,517 --> 00:17:45,650
Hey. You're everywhere.

357
00:17:45,785 --> 00:17:48,683
Well, I'm sorry. For once,
it was actually not on purpose.

358
00:17:51,088 --> 00:17:52,820
Do these look blurry to you?

359
00:17:56,905 --> 00:17:58,162
What exactly am I looking at?

360
00:17:58,198 --> 00:18:00,641
A divorced couple who got
stuck together during--

361
00:18:00,937 --> 00:18:02,933
Oh, wow.
That's gotta be pretty awkward.

362
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:04,321
Yeah. Divorced five years,

363
00:18:04,335 --> 00:18:06,683
and  still going at it
like teens at the prom...

364
00:18:07,298 --> 00:18:08,572
so to speak.

365
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,050
Speaking of divorce...

366
00:18:14,688 --> 00:18:16,830
I heard because I'm
working with your wife.

367
00:18:17,257 --> 00:18:18,311
Ex-wife.

368
00:18:18,446 --> 00:18:20,930
- It was time.
- Good.

369
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:27,882
- How's finn?
- Finn is... fine.

370
00:18:30,515 --> 00:18:31,340
Good.

371
00:18:33,557 --> 00:18:35,003
You're right. They're blurry.

372
00:18:35,988 --> 00:18:37,430
You should get some new ones.

373
00:18:40,868 --> 00:18:42,662
If you go ahead with
the mastectomy,

374
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,920
there are several
reconstructive options.

375
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:47,180
Saline implants are
used most often,

376
00:18:47,355 --> 00:18:49,931
but silicone has a more
natural look and feel.

377
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:53,822
I can't deal with
this right now.

378
00:18:54,077 --> 00:18:56,353
Diana, come on.
It'll take two seconds, huh?

379
00:18:56,465 --> 00:18:59,013
You're the one who has to feel them,
so you decide.

380
00:18:59,088 --> 00:18:59,940
I don't care.

381
00:19:00,047 --> 00:19:02,303
- Dude, believe me, you care.
- Dr. Karev.

382
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:05,002
Dude, he's right. You care.

383
00:19:16,366 --> 00:19:17,440
Dr. Bailey?

384
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:19,372
What's wrong with my wife?

385
00:19:20,008 --> 00:19:21,663
I'm... sorry.

386
00:19:22,106 --> 00:19:23,590
Uh, as you know,

387
00:19:23,766 --> 00:19:26,792
- she has stage 2b breast cancer.
- I know that.

388
00:19:27,286 --> 00:19:30,081
Will you please tell me
what's wrong with her?

389
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,301
- Mr. Niles--
- 'cause she won't.

390
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:33,971
She won't talk to me.

391
00:19:34,037 --> 00:19:37,553
I've tried, and I'm trying.
And I know this sucks, and it's scary,

392
00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:39,823
but we can do this.
We can fight this. But she won't.

393
00:19:39,857 --> 00:19:43,163
She won't even look at Gus. She won't
hold him, and all he wants is his mom.

394
00:19:43,197 --> 00:19:44,031
He's just--

395
00:19:44,168 --> 00:19:45,453
she's such a good mom.

396
00:19:46,175 --> 00:19:49,531
I know it doesn't seem like that,
but she is.

397
00:19:51,096 --> 00:19:54,530
Okay, I can schedule
a psych consult.

398
00:19:54,616 --> 00:19:57,680
I don't want a psych consult.

399
00:19:58,045 --> 00:20:00,203
I just want my wife back.

400
00:20:00,975 --> 00:20:02,093
Please.

401
00:20:02,947 --> 00:20:06,291
Now she's talking crazy, how she
might not have the surgery at all.

402
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:10,221
- Mr. Niles--
- Can you please tell her

403
00:20:10,466 --> 00:20:12,601
that she has to
have the surgery?

404
00:20:13,267 --> 00:20:14,311
Please.

405
00:20:15,136 --> 00:20:16,510
Somebody has to tell her.

406
00:20:18,496 --> 00:20:19,900
I did this for you, you know?

407
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:22,563
You know, you have got to
stop doing things for me.

408
00:20:22,836 --> 00:20:26,813
I'm with Tom now. I love Tom.

409
00:20:26,997 --> 00:20:29,453
I still can't believe
you left me for that guy.

410
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,103
Wh-what does Tom have
that don't, huh?

411
00:20:32,257 --> 00:20:36,791
- Well, he doesn't have a pierced--
- You two need to stay completely still

412
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,113
so that we can get
a clear picture.

413
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:43,313
We fought through 19
years of marriage.

414
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:46,933
The only time we didn't fight
was when we were having sex.

415
00:20:46,965 --> 00:20:48,251
That's not true.

416
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:52,633
- I still love you.
- Okay, I-I'm in hell.

417
00:20:53,388 --> 00:20:55,960
Mom. Dad!

418
00:20:56,095 --> 00:20:59,001
Scratch that. Now I'm in hell.

419
00:21:02,305 --> 00:21:07,511
- Jennifer, maybe you want to go wait in the--
- You guys are so paying for my therapy

420
00:21:08,105 --> 00:21:09,412
and my rent...

421
00:21:10,348 --> 00:21:11,361
and a new car.

422
00:21:11,495 --> 00:21:14,520
- Of course, sweetie.
- Oh, go ahead. Coddle her.

423
00:21:14,695 --> 00:21:16,002
You are old enough

424
00:21:16,155 --> 00:21:18,510
to know that your
parents are sexual beings

425
00:21:18,647 --> 00:21:20,300
and that they make mistakes.

426
00:21:20,448 --> 00:21:23,293
Oh, is that what you call this,
mom, a mistake?

427
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,112
Because I call this you,
once again, being a slut.

428
00:21:26,228 --> 00:21:29,023
Hey! You don't talk to me like that.
I am your mother!

429
00:21:29,157 --> 00:21:31,232
Yeah, and what a great role
model you've turned out to be.

430
00:21:31,267 --> 00:21:34,553
Look at you--cheating on your
husband with your ex-husband. God!

431
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,641
And, daddy, what are you doing?
I thought--

432
00:21:36,677 --> 00:21:38,113
I thought you had
finally moved on.

433
00:21:38,146 --> 00:21:39,730
You said you were
gonna start dating.

434
00:21:39,768 --> 00:21:41,222
It's complicated, honey.

435
00:21:44,276 --> 00:21:48,922
Well, it seems that your I.U.D.
has dislodged from your uterus,

436
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:53,062
hooked on to your husband's piercing
and is embedded in your vaginal wall.

437
00:21:53,388 --> 00:21:55,150
Did she say "piercing"?

438
00:21:55,855 --> 00:21:56,913
Daughter.

439
00:21:57,727 --> 00:21:58,810
Perfect.

440
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:02,871
- Hey.
- Hey.

441
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:06,512
- So... who got the brownstone?
- You heard?

442
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,441
People talk around here.
I listen.

443
00:22:08,877 --> 00:22:11,620
- Who got the brownstone?
- It's none of your business.

444
00:22:12,686 --> 00:22:14,061
I left my bike in the basement.

445
00:22:14,095 --> 00:22:15,823
I just want to know who to
talk to to get it back.

446
00:22:15,858 --> 00:22:17,010
Buy a new bike.

447
00:22:17,207 --> 00:22:20,343
You know, this angry divorcée
thing really turns me on.

448
00:22:23,406 --> 00:22:24,892
I got the brownstone.

449
00:22:25,225 --> 00:22:26,671
And you'll get your bike back

450
00:22:26,905 --> 00:22:29,203
when you come to your
senses and go back home.

451
00:22:29,836 --> 00:22:31,512
Derek took the Hamptons?

452
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:33,181
Derek hates the Hamptons.

453
00:22:33,705 --> 00:22:35,613
Derek gave you
the Hamptons, too?

454
00:22:36,468 --> 00:22:39,343
He still doesn't know the whole story,
does he?

455
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:41,642
And as long as you don't tell him,
you get to be the good guy,

456
00:22:41,677 --> 00:22:44,572
and I'm just the chump who seduced
his wife for the hell of it.

457
00:22:44,607 --> 00:22:45,753
Real fair.

458
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:52,992
I think I'm gonna buy something
for Bailey and for Burke.

459
00:22:53,118 --> 00:22:54,462
What do you think
burke would want?

460
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,910
Nothing you can get with money.

461
00:22:55,946 --> 00:22:56,481
He likes jazz.

462
00:22:56,517 --> 00:22:58,862
I'm not buying him a cd, George.
I'm a multimillionaire.

463
00:22:58,895 --> 00:23:01,643
- I need to buy him something...
- Big.

464
00:23:01,648 --> 00:23:03,760
A house... in the Bahamas.

465
00:23:03,906 --> 00:23:06,622
I'd buy the Bahamas,
or at least a Bahama.

466
00:23:07,116 --> 00:23:09,860
An island. You know,
for $8 million, I'd buy an island.

467
00:23:09,947 --> 00:23:10,780
Oh, you're an intern.

468
00:23:10,818 --> 00:23:13,420
- When would you have time to go to your bahama?
- I'd quit.

469
00:23:13,457 --> 00:23:17,050
Oh, no, you wouldn't. You're a surgeon.
You operate. That's what you do.

470
00:23:20,637 --> 00:23:21,583
Sorry.

471
00:23:21,706 --> 00:23:22,632
What?

472
00:23:23,115 --> 00:23:25,540
It's fine. I'm fine.

473
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:27,430
I am not a surgeon.

474
00:23:27,568 --> 00:23:30,163
My patient?
30 year old with advanced breast cancer.

475
00:23:30,466 --> 00:23:33,762
I say live your life while
you can in the Bahamas.

476
00:23:33,867 --> 00:23:36,062
Have you told Derek yet that
you broke up with Finn?

477
00:23:36,096 --> 00:23:38,261
- I'm giving him time.
- That's stupid.

478
00:23:38,355 --> 00:23:41,651
You know what's stupid? Is carrying
around a check for $8 million.

479
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:48,962
I'm fine. The check is fine.
We're all fine, okay?

480
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,102
I slept with another guy.

481
00:24:02,746 --> 00:24:04,111
Do I tell George?

482
00:24:07,595 --> 00:24:10,313
I, um... broke up with Finn.

483
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:12,963
Do I tell Derek?

484
00:24:16,718 --> 00:24:17,851
I can't tell Derek.

485
00:24:19,865 --> 00:24:21,221
I have to tell George.

486
00:24:26,778 --> 00:24:30,592
Honey, please, at least hold Gus.
No, don't-- stop it.

487
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:33,830
- Will you at least talk to me?
- I want you to leave me alone.

488
00:24:39,447 --> 00:24:41,572
You took a lot of hits
today at that M&M.

489
00:24:42,075 --> 00:24:45,143
Some of 'em justified,
some of 'em not.

490
00:24:45,795 --> 00:24:50,030
Compassion and empathy
are a big part of the job.

491
00:24:50,175 --> 00:24:51,921
Look, I don't care
what Savoy said,

492
00:24:52,568 --> 00:24:54,941
and I know I haven't
always been supportive,

493
00:24:56,696 --> 00:25:00,960
but being a parent makes
you a better doctor.

494
00:25:15,596 --> 00:25:19,162
Hi. I just... wanted to say hi.

495
00:25:21,306 --> 00:25:24,973
Denny left me $8 million--
$8.7 million to be exact.

496
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:28,213
Did you know that he had money?
'Cause I didn't know.

497
00:25:28,746 --> 00:25:30,403
No, I didn't know.

498
00:25:31,457 --> 00:25:33,353
I'm thinking about
using it to travel,

499
00:25:33,607 --> 00:25:36,531
maybe go to Italy. I've never been
there before. I hear Venice is amazing.

500
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:38,321
- Izzie--
- I'm fine.

501
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:40,083
Really, I am. I'm fine.

502
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,092
Everyone thinks I'm not.
Everyone thinks I'm...

503
00:25:43,677 --> 00:25:45,083
but I'm fine.

504
00:25:45,937 --> 00:25:50,773
You're fine. I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

505
00:25:53,298 --> 00:25:55,520
- So...
- I got shot.

506
00:25:57,368 --> 00:26:01,042
I got shot because I was coming back
to the hospital to check on Denny.

507
00:26:02,547 --> 00:26:04,790
Because you told me to.

508
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,232
I'm not fine.

509
00:26:07,855 --> 00:26:13,313
Denny asked you to marry him,
and now he is dead. You're not fine.

510
00:26:13,457 --> 00:26:15,042
Don't come in here and...

511
00:26:18,456 --> 00:26:22,860
just... we're not fine.

512
00:26:25,028 --> 00:26:26,480
I'm sorry.

513
00:26:27,726 --> 00:26:29,243
We were friends.

514
00:26:29,347 --> 00:26:31,021
You were my boss, but...

515
00:26:31,347 --> 00:26:33,363
I think we were friends, too.

516
00:26:34,307 --> 00:26:36,002
And--and I never meant...

517
00:26:37,217 --> 00:26:38,693
for anyone to get hurt.

518
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:41,883
And I know there is nothing
I can do to take it back.

519
00:26:43,126 --> 00:26:44,423
No.

520
00:26:44,977 --> 00:26:47,360
Preston, please--

521
00:26:47,516 --> 00:26:51,950
You quit. You quit...
being a surgeon.

522
00:26:52,818 --> 00:26:54,890
You have two good hands...

523
00:26:55,836 --> 00:26:57,871
and you aren't using them.

524
00:26:58,406 --> 00:27:00,550
Feel guilty about that.

525
00:27:10,617 --> 00:27:12,812
Sonja, quit grabbing my leg.

526
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:15,581
I am not grabbing you anywhere.
She is.

527
00:27:15,728 --> 00:27:19,523
Mr. Morris, we need to position you
correctly in order to get a clear image.

528
00:27:20,826 --> 00:27:23,052
Dr. Yang,
move him a little to the left.

529
00:27:27,526 --> 00:27:28,970
Hey. What are you doing here?

530
00:27:29,027 --> 00:27:33,041
Oh, I heard about it.
I had to see it.

531
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:36,713
And I've seen enough.

532
00:27:36,925 --> 00:27:39,893
Dr. Yang, I need you to lift
him a little as you pull him.

533
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:41,132
Trying.

534
00:27:42,115 --> 00:27:45,062
Now lift his right
leg 20 degrees.

535
00:27:47,138 --> 00:27:47,942
Pain!

536
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,533
Freeze! Hold that position.

537
00:27:49,636 --> 00:27:54,601
Okay, now, Dr. Grey, can you kind
of slowly swirl Mrs. Kellman

538
00:27:54,745 --> 00:27:56,633
in a
counterclockwise direction?

539
00:27:56,767 --> 00:27:58,553
Swirl? Swirl?

540
00:27:58,698 --> 00:28:00,551
Swirl. Swirl.

541
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,061
Oh, my god, Sonja.

542
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,100
Oh, god, Adam. Not now.

543
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,260
- Careful. Careful.
- Oh, my god.

544
00:28:11,446 --> 00:28:13,431
- Oh, my god.
- Okay, now, Grey, Yang,

545
00:28:13,616 --> 00:28:17,423
on the count of three, I want you
to slowly, gently pull them apart.

546
00:28:17,546 --> 00:28:20,492
One, two, three.

547
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:24,132
Oh, okay. He's having a--

548
00:28:24,305 --> 00:28:25,331
Sonja!

549
00:28:25,668 --> 00:28:27,441
Heart attack!
He's having a heart attack!

550
00:28:27,478 --> 00:28:29,671
Oh, thank god.
I mean, code blue.

551
00:28:30,816 --> 00:28:32,592
Oh, he's tearing
through his aorta.

552
00:28:32,825 --> 00:28:35,041
We need to get him to an O.R.
now, or he's gonna die.

553
00:28:35,076 --> 00:28:37,121
Who's the cardiothoracic
surgeon on call?

554
00:28:37,128 --> 00:28:38,610
Dr. Harrison.
But he's in the middle of surgery.

555
00:28:38,647 --> 00:28:39,591
Where's Burke?

556
00:28:40,306 --> 00:28:42,522
He's in the conference room,
but he's not on the board yet.

557
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:45,422
Well, he is now. Notify the O.R.
Let's move, people.

558
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:46,870
Come on. Go, go, go.

559
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:57,180
How do we do this?

560
00:28:57,275 --> 00:28:58,421
You stand on my right side.

561
00:28:58,455 --> 00:28:59,383
On your right side...

562
00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:01,072
and if at any time
during the procedure--

563
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:01,921
if you tremor...

564
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:05,960
I'll look at you. You'll know to slide
in to do the sutures we've practiced.

565
00:29:07,586 --> 00:29:10,562
What if one of the scrub nurses notices?
What if they say something?

566
00:29:10,596 --> 00:29:13,063
Cristina, I can't walk
away from this surgery.

567
00:29:13,736 --> 00:29:15,532
If I do,
that man in there will die.

568
00:29:15,577 --> 00:29:18,280
So tremor or no tremor,
I have to try.

569
00:29:18,576 --> 00:29:19,463
But you--

570
00:29:19,555 --> 00:29:23,961
I'm your intern.
I will be there on your right side.

571
00:29:42,415 --> 00:29:43,423
10 blade.

572
00:29:54,005 --> 00:29:57,652
As soon as we hear something about
your ex-husband, we'll let you know.

573
00:29:57,785 --> 00:30:01,610
Since I removed your I.U.D.,
you may want to use a backup method.

574
00:30:01,796 --> 00:30:06,220
Oh, I doubt I'll be having sex
anytime soon once I tell Tom.

575
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,861
You're--you're gonna
tell your husband?

576
00:30:11,756 --> 00:30:15,401
You know, the first time it happened,
I felt so guilty,

577
00:30:15,698 --> 00:30:19,272
and I wasn't gonna tell Tom because
it was never gonna happen again.

578
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:24,013
And then it happened
again and again.

579
00:30:25,668 --> 00:30:29,921
And then somewhere along the way,
I just stopped feeling guilty.

580
00:30:30,987 --> 00:30:34,481
Yeah... I'm gonna
tell my husband.

581
00:30:36,727 --> 00:30:40,423
I think the truth just has to come out,
you know?

582
00:31:04,987 --> 00:31:06,673
Dr. Burke,
I know it's a lot to ask,

583
00:31:06,705 --> 00:31:10,351
but I would really appreciate if you'd
let me try my running whip stitch.

584
00:31:17,866 --> 00:31:19,881
All right, take a good bite.

585
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,463
You want to make
sure it holds. Good.

586
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:25,463
Don't put too much pressure.

587
00:31:27,805 --> 00:31:29,951
There. Keep going.

588
00:31:33,365 --> 00:31:35,313
Oh, my god.

589
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,720
Cristina's doing a running
whip stitch on a heart.

590
00:31:38,827 --> 00:31:41,253
I guess sleeping with
your boss has its perks.

591
00:31:41,838 --> 00:31:45,100
This sucks.
Cristina gets sex and perks.

592
00:31:45,457 --> 00:31:47,972
Maybe you should just
apologize again, George.

593
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:51,470
Yeah, 'cause you're in a great
position to give relationship advice.

594
00:31:53,296 --> 00:31:57,171
Cristina's doing a running
whip stitch on a heart.

595
00:32:02,786 --> 00:32:04,413
I don't feel like talking.

596
00:32:09,348 --> 00:32:13,853
When I'm driving home at night
after a long day at work,

597
00:32:14,297 --> 00:32:17,730
all I can think about
is getting to my baby.

598
00:32:18,598 --> 00:32:20,372
If this is where you tell
me to fight the cancer

599
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,251
so I don't miss out on
the joys of motherhood--

600
00:32:22,285 --> 00:32:25,421
Then I get home--
the baby's crying...

601
00:32:27,527 --> 00:32:34,981
the exhaustion hits, and I resent that
tiny baby's presence in my house,

602
00:32:35,605 --> 00:32:39,611
my previously very quiet house.

603
00:32:39,747 --> 00:32:41,282
Why are you telling me this?

604
00:32:41,756 --> 00:32:43,602
So you know what I do?

605
00:32:44,578 --> 00:32:47,552
First, I pick a fight
with my husband,

606
00:32:47,646 --> 00:32:51,092
you know, blame him for
not settling the baby down,

607
00:32:51,256 --> 00:32:54,700
then I bitch about the
neighbors' loud music.

608
00:32:54,827 --> 00:33:02,973
And if I'm really tired and
pissed off... I blame the baby.

609
00:33:05,747 --> 00:33:08,460
I mean,
if you hadn't been breast-feeding,

610
00:33:08,585 --> 00:33:13,111
you never would've thought the
lump was a clogged milk duct.

611
00:33:13,698 --> 00:33:17,651
You would've gone to the
doctor as soon as you felt it,

612
00:33:18,007 --> 00:33:20,341
the cancer wouldn't
have gotten this far,

613
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:23,491
and you wouldn't be here
making this decision.

614
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:27,261
Am I close?

615
00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:33,941
What kind of mother blames
her own baby for her cancer?

616
00:33:34,358 --> 00:33:40,103
A mother who's human.
A mother who's overwhelmed.

617
00:33:43,307 --> 00:33:46,683
But if this is gonna kill me eventually,
wouldn't it be easier

618
00:33:46,827 --> 00:33:49,170
if it happed when
Gus was little?

619
00:33:49,286 --> 00:33:52,270
Wouldn't it be easier for
him if I just never existed?

620
00:33:53,127 --> 00:33:59,071
Now this is the part when I
tell you to fight the cancer

621
00:33:59,218 --> 00:34:03,431
so that you don't miss out
on the joys of motherhood.

622
00:34:05,445 --> 00:34:06,580
Derek.

623
00:34:06,718 --> 00:34:08,010
Hey, you know what I like?

624
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,563
I like that we're civilized.

625
00:34:10,737 --> 00:34:14,192
We're these adult, grown-up people
who can be divorced and friendly.

626
00:34:14,337 --> 00:34:15,640
We deserve a medal.

627
00:34:15,747 --> 00:34:17,741
- It wasn't a one-night stand.
- What?

628
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:21,191
Mark and I-- it wasn't a one-night
stand. I was in love with him.

629
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:23,901
Or... at least,
I thought I was.

630
00:34:24,676 --> 00:34:27,580
After you left,
we lived together for two months.

631
00:34:27,656 --> 00:34:29,772
I wanted to believe that
we could make it work,

632
00:34:29,807 --> 00:34:34,580
that I hadn't thrown my marriage away,
that I hadn't thrown my life away on a fling.

633
00:34:35,478 --> 00:34:38,802
But he's Mark, and, well...

634
00:34:39,028 --> 00:34:41,571
I caught him with
someone else, and...

635
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:44,410
and then Richard called...

636
00:34:45,638 --> 00:34:48,530
We both had relationships
with other people.

637
00:34:48,647 --> 00:34:54,142
We're both equally liable for everything,
so please take the brownstone.

638
00:34:54,855 --> 00:34:56,710
All I want is Seattle.

639
00:34:56,835 --> 00:35:00,363
I want Seattle,
and I want never to see you again.

640
00:35:23,448 --> 00:35:29,323
You're here. You're everywhere,
and I can't not tell you.

641
00:35:30,675 --> 00:35:36,262
You know, I've been... not telling you
all day because I thought it was kind,

642
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:38,731
and I thought I was
giving you space.

643
00:35:38,856 --> 00:35:43,292
But I can't not tell you because
you're here and you're you and...

644
00:35:45,265 --> 00:35:47,693
I broke up with Finn.

645
00:36:06,496 --> 00:36:07,590
I told you.

646
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,500
The operation was successful.

647
00:36:19,656 --> 00:36:22,311
The next 24 to 48 hours
are really critical, but--

648
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:24,712
We expect your father to
make a full recovery.

649
00:36:25,346 --> 00:36:27,301
Thank you so much, Dr. Burke.

650
00:36:28,195 --> 00:36:32,802
<i>First do no harm--
easier said than done.</i>

651
00:36:34,846 --> 00:36:37,680
<i>We can take all the
oaths in the world,</i>

652
00:36:38,005 --> 00:36:43,953
<i>but the fact is...
most of us do harm all the time.</i>

653
00:36:46,568 --> 00:36:48,342
I have $8 million.

654
00:36:48,816 --> 00:36:50,302
So I've heard.

655
00:36:53,276 --> 00:36:57,071
- I can... do anything I want.
- Just about.

656
00:36:59,536 --> 00:37:02,462
And all I really want to do
is a running whip stitch.

657
00:37:05,137 --> 00:37:07,381
My first year as an intern,

658
00:37:07,546 --> 00:37:10,362
I had a stable cardiac
patient who blew out his lung

659
00:37:10,517 --> 00:37:12,542
while I was transporting
him to C.T.

660
00:37:13,185 --> 00:37:14,581
I called in the code.

661
00:37:14,738 --> 00:37:17,313
By the time everyone got there,
he was dead.

662
00:37:18,265 --> 00:37:20,953
If I had put a chest
tube in right away...

663
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:23,931
you made a mistake.

664
00:37:25,707 --> 00:37:31,180
But I stayed.
I worked. I learned.

665
00:37:33,205 --> 00:37:35,632
I never made that
mistake again.

666
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:44,003
If I had quit, all I would have
had was that life... that I lost.

667
00:37:45,575 --> 00:37:48,201
Instead, I get to save lives.

668
00:37:49,347 --> 00:37:53,060
Every day, I get to save lives.

669
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:56,172
<i>Sometimes even when
we're trying to help...</i>

670
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:58,750
<i>we do more harm than good...</i>

671
00:38:06,248 --> 00:38:07,542
She told you.

672
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:16,603
I've known you my whole life. I grew up
with you, so I know what you're thinking...

673
00:38:18,845 --> 00:38:21,462
That there is a year
of your life wasted

674
00:38:22,645 --> 00:38:26,293
trying to make it work with Addison,
and you could've been with Meredith,

675
00:38:26,725 --> 00:38:28,860
that you could be
happy right now,

676
00:38:29,855 --> 00:38:31,492
that all this...

677
00:38:32,898 --> 00:38:34,302
everything...

678
00:38:36,865 --> 00:38:39,583
that you and Meredith
could've had a real chance.

679
00:38:41,606 --> 00:38:43,071
Still...

680
00:38:47,028 --> 00:38:53,690
I thought you should know the truth. I
thought I owed you that... as a friend.

681
00:38:54,448 --> 00:38:55,813
You're not my friend.

682
00:38:59,877 --> 00:39:02,691
<i>And then the guilt
rears its ugly head.</i>

683
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,470
<i>What you do with that
guilt is up to you.</i>

684
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:11,031
Babysitting, Dr. Bailey?

685
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:14,371
That's right. I'm babysitting.

686
00:39:14,547 --> 00:39:18,540
I'm being all unprofessional
and emotionally involved

687
00:39:18,757 --> 00:39:22,231
while my patient and her husband
are having a moment together.

688
00:39:23,755 --> 00:39:26,013
Oh, you might want
to leave now.

689
00:39:26,185 --> 00:39:28,741
I'm feeling a rush of
hormones coming on.

690
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:30,571
There's no telling
what I might do.

691
00:39:36,088 --> 00:39:37,281
How's it going in there?

692
00:39:37,378 --> 00:39:39,501
I think they're leaning
towards a mastectomy.

693
00:39:39,537 --> 00:39:40,663
Well, that's good.

694
00:39:41,617 --> 00:39:46,670
Uh, about Izzie...
I didn't do anything.

695
00:39:46,777 --> 00:39:50,002
I know, Karev. You didn't do anything.
You weren't even here.

696
00:39:50,126 --> 00:39:53,190
No, listen... I knew.

697
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:56,920
Izzie told me what she was gonna do,
but I didn't want to get involved.

698
00:39:57,557 --> 00:40:02,500
I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything
to stop her. You weren't the only one.

699
00:40:04,387 --> 00:40:09,103
Alex. Thank you.

700
00:40:14,377 --> 00:40:16,242
We're left with a choice...

701
00:40:21,226 --> 00:40:25,112
I got fried chicken--
extra crispy-- coleslaw,

702
00:40:25,317 --> 00:40:29,933
peach cobbler,
"beetle jump" and...

703
00:40:32,665 --> 00:40:34,823
"samurai ambush."

704
00:40:35,365 --> 00:40:38,962
The other night... when I told
you I was done trying to compete?

705
00:40:39,035 --> 00:40:40,891
That was me breaking
up with you.

706
00:40:41,848 --> 00:40:43,150
No.

707
00:40:44,296 --> 00:40:46,652
No, I think I would've
noticed that.

708
00:40:47,026 --> 00:40:51,922
Except you didn't...
which is why I broke up with you.

709
00:40:54,975 --> 00:40:57,910
<i>At least now you don't have
to feel guilty anymore.</i>

710
00:40:59,777 --> 00:41:01,351
Shut up.

711
00:41:01,887 --> 00:41:04,721
<i>Either let the guilt throw you back into the behavior</i> 

712
00:41:04,775 --> 00:41:07,081
<i>that got you into trouble in the first place</i>

713
00:41:08,868 --> 00:41:16,922
<i>or... learn from the guilt
and do your best to move on.</i>

714
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:21,473
Are you seriously not going
to deposit that check?

715
00:41:24,927 --> 00:41:27,201
Some good needs to
come from this money.

716
00:41:27,338 --> 00:41:31,951
Until I don't know what that good is,
no, I'm not depositing the check.

717
