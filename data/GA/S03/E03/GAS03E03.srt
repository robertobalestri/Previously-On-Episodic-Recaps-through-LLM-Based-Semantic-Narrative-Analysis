1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,850
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:02,950
You're shot?

3
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:03,660
Cristina?

4
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,330
- You're throwing me out?
- Got no choice.

5
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,950
What's with the suitcase?

6
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,680
Yes.
My answer is yes.

7
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,820
An hour ago, he was proposing.

8
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,740
I thought I was a surgeon, but I am not.

9
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,130
I stopped teaching when you needed a teacher the most.

10
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,460
Our marriage is over.

11
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,800
There's this thing that allows for the considering of options.

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,530
In the olden days, they called it dating.

13
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,860
You bowing out?

14
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,690
No.
You?

15
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,110
I don't think so.

16
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,190
Surgeons usually fantasize about wild and improbable surgeries--

17
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,730
someone collapses in a restaurant,
we slice them open with a butter knife,

18
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,730
replace a valve with a hollowed-out stick of carrot.

19
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,260
But every now and then,
some other kind of fantasy slips in.

20
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,120
Good morning.

21
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,830
Good morning.

22
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,630
- Good morning.
- It is a good morning.

23
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,670
- Hi.
- Hi.

24
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,360
Did you get any sleep last night?

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,750
Not really.

26
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,800
You want to get some now?

27
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,760
Not really.

28
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,860
Most of our fantasies dissolve when we wake,

29
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,230
banished to the back of our mind.

30
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,820
But sometimes, we're sure...

31
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,770
If we try hard enough...

32
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,590
We can live the dream.

33
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,860
Damn it!
Stupid--

34
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,910
I was having a really good dream, and you ruined it.

35
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,710
Sorry.

36
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,550
It's,uh,the,uh,these boxes.
All these boxes.

37
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,240
Callie said she was bringing her stuff over,and,uh...

38
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,690
it's all here.

39
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,260
It's okay,george.
I don't mind.

40
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,830
I don't mind either.
No.

41
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,610
Don't mind a bit.
Kick her out.

42
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,670
What?
I can't kick her out.

43
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,130
You were the one who told her she could move in.

44
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,370
I said she could stay for a couple of days--
a couple of days.

45
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,510
It's been over a week.
Now there are boxes,and she's using my computer.

46
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,170
And she's here all the time.
Would you kick her out? And kick her out now.

47
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,140
Hey,you guys might want to wait a little while.
There's no more hot water.

48
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,500
do it.
Why do you hate me? Just do it.

49
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,480
Hey.
Can I get a ride with you guys to the hospital?

50
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,360
You're going to the hospital?

51
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,700
Yeah,I'm--
I'm gonna go in,talk to the chief,see about coming back.

52
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,810
Anyway,just let me know when you're leaving.

53
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,380
that's great.
Izzie is coming back. That'S...

54
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,670
great,right?

55
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,080
That's my towel.

56
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,630
Sorry.

57
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,410
boy,he is really moody in the mornings.

58
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,570
Yeah.
He's,uh...

59
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,460
- yeah.
- Yeah.

60
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,780
You know I don't have to leave today.

61
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,430
I could change my flight.

62
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,030
No.
No,you can't.

63
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,270
Because I'M...

64
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,420
sober now,and,uh,there's work to get to and--

65
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,710
and planes to be caught and real lives to be led.

66
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,770
Thank you,truly,mark,for all of the...
sex.

67
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,260
I-I really,I feel much better now.
I do.

68
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,020
And I'm-- I'm--
well,now I have to go,and so do you.

69
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,870
So,uh,do you,uh,want me to call you...

70
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,670
a cab to the airport?

71
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,310
Why don't you try your bad hand?

72
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,980
That's what the ball's for,right,fixing your bad hand?

73
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,440
Works.

74
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,100
There's coffee on the floor.

75
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,810
Fine. I'll--
you know what? I'll clean it up.

76
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,730
Whatever.
Leave it.

77
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,560
It doesn't matter.

78
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,480
So I was thinking,since your shift ends after mine,

79
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,720
and I don't want to have to wait around,
maybe I should get a copy of the house key.

80
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,570
No.

81
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,370
I like leaving together.
You don't need a key.

82
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,010
Izzie?

83
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,560
I'll see you guys in there.

84
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,000
Everything's gonna be fine.
Bailey is on your side.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,690
And the chief is...

86
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,750
he is gonna put on his angry face,
but he's on your side,too.

87
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,450
Everybody wants you back in that building.

88
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,350
I know.
I know.

89
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,300
You guys go ahead.
I'll be fine.

90
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,730
I'm just gonna take a minute,practice my speech.

91
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,610
Okay.

92
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,090
I didn't ask you to convince her to come in.

93
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,080
But I di I d cod.
Ince her.

94
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,200
There is a whole series of disciplinary and rehabilitative
steps that izzie stevens will have to take

95
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,360
- before we can--
- you can explain them to her.

96
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,840
- I never agreed to that.
- She didn't commit a crime.

97
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,540
She's an intern--
my intern.

98
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,720
You--
you want to blame someone,blame me.

99
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,180
Look,but that girl is coming in hertoday,and--
and--

100
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,930
and you are going to talk to her.

101
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,200
And you're gonna remember all the other surgeons you've known

102
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,920
who've ever had a lapse in judgment that led to someone dying

103
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,810
or someone's arm falling off.

104
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:45,340
Most importantly,you're gonna remember all the mistakes
that you made when you were young and stupid.

105
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,920
And you're gonna be filled with patience and compassion.

106
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,120
- That's what I'm gonna do?
- Yes!

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,120
- Because I'm the boss.
- I'M...

108
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,680
look,I didn't mean any disrespect,sir.
I apologize.

109
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,080
This is really important to you personally.

110
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,160
Very personally,sir,yes.

111
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,570
Being the boss isn't as gratifying as it used to be.

112
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,630
No,sir.

113
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,570
Get outta here.

114
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,310
I'm on my knees in a puddle of coffee,
and he's lying on the couch playing with himself.

115
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,830
You know,and not in a good way.

116
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:32,420
T he's recovering from surgery,and you've read
the studies on recovery and depression in surgical patients.

117
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,690
Well,he's not a patient.
He's preston burke.

118
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,310
He's just milking it.

119
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,040
You know,he's got me fetching his food
and the paper and his slippers like I'm a dog.

120
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,550
- Hey.
- Hi.

121
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,320
I had a dream about you last night.

122
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,390
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

123
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,950
What was I doing,bringing you coffee?

124
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,600
You were definitely not bringing me coffee.

125
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,740
But coffee's good.

126
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,950
I'm told dating starts with a casual invitation over a cup of coffee.

127
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,570
Does it?

128
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,930
So,meredith,would you like to go out to dinner with me tonight?

129
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,830
How was that? Was that casual enough?
That was good,right?

130
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,280
- So we're dating.
- We're dating.

131
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,240
Pick you up at 8:00.

132
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,530
- hey.
- I was in the neighborhood.

133
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,900
Actually,I wasn't.
But I decided you were worth a detour.

134
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,250
I had a dream about you last night.

135
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,980
- Was it a good dream?
- It was.

136
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,550
- And what was I doing?
- Yes,mer,what was he doing?

137
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,780
- What's that?
- It's for you. It's coffee cake--

138
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,860
best in the northwest.

139
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,370
Figure I better soften you up so that when
I ask you to dinner tonight,you have to say yes.

140
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,980
Uh,dinner tonight?
How about that?

141
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,170
Are you free tonight,meredith?

142
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,140
Actually,uh,I'm not free tonight.

143
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,640
Well,how about lunch?
I could come here.

144
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,280
You're volunteering to eat hospital food?

145
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,820
I love crappy food.

146
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,600
- 1:00?
- I'll be here.

147
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,150
Okay.

148
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,990
You had a dream about the both of them?

149
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,240
A threesome?

150
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,230
Nice.
Just when I think you're boring,you rise.

151
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,950
I'm dating.
And...

152
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,460
it comes with snacks.

153
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,290
- Hey,iz.
- Hey.

154
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,980
- I'm going in to see the chief.
- Excellent.

155
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,940
Back in the game,stepping up to the plate.

156
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,010
Look,I'm-- I'm running late.
Um,I'll catch you later?

157
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,480
Yeah,later.

158
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,670
Izzie's back.
That's good.

159
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,920
Ooh,coffee cake.

160
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,660
I'm dating.

161
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,270
Touch that piece,lose a hand.

162
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,650
Morning,people.

163
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,690
Grey,we're clearing the decks.
I need you writing discharge forms.

164
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,400
Yang,you're with Dr. Shepherd.

165
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,480
Karev,as usual,you're with Dr. Montgomery-
shepherd in O.B.-G.Y.N.

166
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,340
O'malley,Dr. Torres has requested you today in ortho.

167
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,690
- Was she smiling?
- Izzie's back.

168
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,720
"Dr. Torres has requested you."

169
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,690
Just tell her,george.

170
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,860
Tell her you're not ready to move in together.

171
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,610
And then try dating.
Dating is fun.

172
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,060
Karev,we ready?

173
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,270
- Isn't this getting old for you?
- nope.

174
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,310
Makes my whole day,actually.

175
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,250
hello.
Hello.

176
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,330
Are you okay?

177
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,180
No.
Uh,ye--

178
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,480
n-no,I can't.
I gotta--

179
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,160
five minutes.

180
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,390
- Go find something to do in the pit.
- Personal problem?

181
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,540
go.

182
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,030
fourth visit in three months.

183
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,490
I'm Dr. Karev.
And you are...

184
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,710
megan clover.
And it's not as bad as it looks.

185
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:33,450
She fell on the playground,
and there was a lot of blood,and it looked deep.

186
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:38,340
We know how this looks.
Just so you know,we know how this looks,and it's not that.

187
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,510
She just...
plays rough.

188
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,820
You know?

189
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,050
This is her file,all right?
And it goes back since way before we got her.

190
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,450
Before you got her?

191
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,410
We're her foster parents.

192
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,500
She's such a great kid,but she plays really--

193
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,270
- she plays rough.
- Yeah.

194
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,360
Right.
Uh...

195
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,500
why don't you guys go up to the nurses' station
and let them make a copy of her file for you?

196
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,430
And,uh,I'll take a look at megan's leg.

197
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,730
Okay.

198
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,490
We'll be right back,honey.
You all right?

199
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,940
- Yeah.
- okay.

200
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,080
You got some mean looking bruises,you know that?

201
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,090
What,did you hurt your arm,too?

202
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,920
Nothing big.
I fell off my bike.

203
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,300
Are those staples?
What the hell?

204
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,910
- Did they do this to you?
- No!

205
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,700
- No!
- Who did this to you?

206
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,680
I did.

207
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,630
I didn't want to go to the doctor again,so I just stapled it.
It's no biggie.

208
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,870
You stapled your own arm?

209
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,450
Can you please just stitch up my leg so we can get out of here?

210
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,650
You're not going anywhere with those people,megan.
They're never gonna lay a hand on you again.

211
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,230
They didn't do anything. Please.
They're my best parents I've ever had.

212
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,830
- Megan.
- They don't hurt me.

213
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,840
I can't be hurt.
You don't believe me?

214
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,460
Punch me in the stomach right now.

215
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,320
The staples are in there pretty deep.
I'm gonna have to give you a shot to numb the pain.

216
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,380
I don't need a shot.

217
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,410
Trust me. You want a shot.
It's swollen. It's gonna hurt like A...

218
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,640
there.
Can I go now?

219
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,370
That didn't even hurt?

220
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,650
I have superpowers,okay?

Mrtreslt'savseing a corpus callosotomy.

224
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,260
What's that gonna look like?

225
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,660
We'll be severing some of the fibers that connect
the rightnd left hemisphere of his brain...

226
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,480
To prevent the spread of seizure activity from
one half of his brain to the other.

227
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,230
Good.
Right.

228
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,730
Daddy's letting them chop his brain in half
because daddy's a big dummy.

229
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,500
Yes,he is.

230
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,510
They're not chopping my brain in half,leanne.

231
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,000
Chop!
Right down the middle.

232
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,700
Taylor should function much like he does right now.

233
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,420
Really?

234
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,800
- I'm having five seizures a day,leanne.
- I know that.

235
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,720
You don't leave me in a room alone with the baby.
You think I don't notice?

236
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,050
You ask your mother to come by every time you need to take a shower.

237
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,360
- That's not the reason.
- It's because you think I'm a danger to the baby.

238
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,290
And I am.

239
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,690
Look,if you're not sure,for any reason,we can wait.

240
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,540
I want to be able to take care of our baby.

241
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,750
Please,leanne,we already agreed.

242
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,060
Please.

243
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,810
I got this kid in the pit.

244
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,690
She's psycho and her foster parents are beating the crap out of her.

245
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,010
She tell you that or you figure it out yourself?

246
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,850
Well,she's covered in bruises.
She's got a 10-centimeter lac on her arm with three staples in it,

247
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,610
like from a staple gun in your garage.

248
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,830
- Her parents did that?
- Well,she saysshe d it herself.

249
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,090
She's got this whole bit about being a superhero
and how she can take the pain.

250
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,110
- You call social services?
- They're on their way down.

251
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,720
Okay,well,ha them speak to the parents while you
run a cold pressure test on the girl.

252
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,310
A what?

253
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,510
Ice water.
Test her response to pain.

254
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,600
At the very least,it'll keep her distracted
while the parents are questioned.

255
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,940
You requested me?

256
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,990
Yeah,I did.

257
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,040
- You were weird this morning.
- I wasn't weird...

258
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,360
any more than I normally am in the morning.

259
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,170
It's a weird time of day for a lot of people.
It's bright...

260
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,080
and crowded at our house in the morning.
There's just a lot of people running around.

261
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,150
Good.
We have a radical case today.

262
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,310
You're gonna be glad you're with me.

263
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,560
Thanks.

264
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,410
Mr. Jasper hobie.

265
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,800
- Dr. T.
- Hey!

266
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,820
You missed me.

267
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,570
More than words can say.

268
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,800
This is Dr. O'malley.
He's gonna be helping out.

269
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,360
Hi.How you doin'?
June 12th,baby.

270
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,690
2.4-mile swim,112 miles on the bike and then a marathon.

271
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,940
- That is rockin'.
- Am I gonna be ready?

272
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,870
You bet your sculpted ass you are.

273
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,720
I love this woman.

274
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,590
you had three surgeries last year.

275
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,470
Yeah,two rotator cuffs and an A.C.L.

276
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,960
All with Dr. T.

277
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,350
And now you're having an ankle replacement?

278
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,640
We waited over a year for a match.

279
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,660
We're gonna replace his ankle with an ankle joint from a cadaver.

280
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,390
- Who's my guy?
- Your donor?

281
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,030
Well,he hasn't been dead long,right?

282
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,460
Um,about a week.
And he's downstairs.

283
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,160
No way.
Can I meet him,pay my respects?

284
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,590
I don't think you two are gonna have much to talk about.

285
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,830
Dr. O'malley's gonna handle your labs.

286
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,920
have you met my guy?

287
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,890
Hey,superkid.

288
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,990
Where are my parents?

289
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,250
They're talking to some grown-ups.

290
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,430
I'm not a moron.
They're talking to a social worker.

291
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,010
Megan...

292
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,450
these bruises,these cuts all over you,this isn't normal.

293
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,930
I t in fights a lot,okay?

294
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,120
Because I'm stronger than some of the other kids,

295
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,440
so I end up defending the ones who are wimpy or small or whatever.

296
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,860
You know you're scrawny,right?
I mean,you're not one of the big kids.

297
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,980
Yeah,but I can take them in a fight.

298
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,750
All right.
Put your hands in here.

299
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,900
Why?

300
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,520
Because...
we're gonna test your superpowers.

301
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,560
You don't believe me?
Punch me in the stomach right here. Come on.

302
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,580
- Punch me in the stomach.
- Let's just stick to the water.

303
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,100
Just put your hand in here.

304
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,410
And I'll-- I'll race you.
You can race me.

305
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,660
What?
Come on.

306
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,610
What are you afraid of,uh,you afraid of a little ice?

307
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,660
You afraid I'm gonna beat you?
Come on.

308
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,320
On the count of three.

309
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,770
One,two,three.

310
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,060
Pull your hand out when it starts to hurt,please.

311
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,610
What are you,deaf?
It won't start to hurt.

312
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,990
Just think about it,okay?

313
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,930
Superheroes are all kids with dead parents,like me.

314
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,480
And they all figured out when they were around my age

315
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,740
they could do things that nobody else could,like me.

316
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,290
You missed your plane?

317
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,770
Grounded on account of bad weather.

318
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:46,300
It's a cloudless sky.
That happens like,twice a year in seattle.

319
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,750
Yeah,but there's a typhoon in new york.

320
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,900
Sit down.
Have a drink with me.

321
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,880
No,I'm not having a drink with you.

322
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,080
I am working.
At work,not here.

323
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,980
So coffee,right?

324
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,670
- Mark--
- joe,can we get the doctor a coffee?

325
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,980
And they think it's weird that they can do all this stuff,

326
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,210
but they don't tell anybody because people would freak out like you d.

327
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,240
What's wrong with you?

328
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:15,420
Son of a--

329
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,570
Take your hand outta there before it falls off.

330
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,680
You need to relax.

331
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,940
You didn't feel anything?
Nothing?

332
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,160
No.
Nobody ever believes me.

333
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,060
Like yesterday in school,this kid said I was full of it.

334
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,600
I had to letim punch me in the stomach
25 times before he believed me,

335
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,070
and once with a baseball bat.

336
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,110
What?

337
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,250
We'll have cardiology check this,and then you'll be good to go.

338
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,400
All done.
There's my guy.

339
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,320
Jake...

340
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,080
we're almost all done with this whole thing.

341
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,210
we're not almost done.

342
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:52,900
You still have brain surgery and god knows
how many weeks of recovery ahead of you.

343
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,010
She's right.

344
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,250
It's good to know what you're getting yourself into.

345
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,150
Thank you.

346
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,750
I appreciate that.

347
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,420
Yeah.
Recovery's hell on the spouse.

348
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,540
It's gonna be harder for you than on him.

349
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,730
My mom's staying with us for a week.
Maybe she should stay longerer.

350
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,100
You know,it's--
it's brutal being the caretaker.

351
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,680
You'll be fetching the paper and then cleaning the carpet...

352
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,210
honey.

353
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,980
And oh-- oh,he wants ice in a cup,not a mug.
It's like-- it never stops.

354
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,750
It's the caretakers that are the silent victims.

355
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,500
You know,and when do you ever hear about them?

356
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,590
- Honey,take the baby.
- Never.

357
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,880
I never hear anything about them.

358
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,880
It's always,you know,"the patient this,the patient that."

359
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,680
Silent victims.

360
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,460
Honey,take the baby.

361
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,780
Taylor!

362
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,570
Can someone help here,please?

363
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,990
his seizure lasted about a minute,
and he was post-ictal for five.

364
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,160
- Is the baby okay?
- He's fine.

365
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,130
It shouldn't interfere with his surgery,assuming we're still going forward.

366
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,390
Honey?

367
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,190
Yeah.
I guess we don't have any other choice.

368
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,680
All right,leanne,I'm gonna do everything I can,okay?

369
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,410
It's not gonna be a walk in the park,but I'm gonna take care of him.

370
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,680
okay.

371
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,940
Hey,izzie.
You done with the chief?

372
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,600
Not yet.

373
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,260
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

374
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,740
- What are you guys doing?
- Uh,she's dating everyone with a pulse,and,uh,

375
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,710
I'm trying to get burke out of the beljar.

376
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,620
Crap.I'm late for finn.
Gotta go.

377
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,040
- You're sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

378
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,460
she's playing the field,and I've got a wife.

379
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,200
Point to the justice.

380
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,860
Here's the thing--

381
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,160
we've both really enjoyed each other,

382
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,380
b-before and now again,and--

383
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,770
and I think that's a healthy release.

384
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,120
I mean,I-I think it's--

385
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,430
it's healthy,I mean,for everybody involved.

386
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,030
And,um--

387
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,310
but I do think that just because I made

388
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,760
what can only be considered a transcontinental...

389
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,810
booty call...

390
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:04,100
doesn't mean that we should be trying to make something out of this.

391
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,640
I mean,we-- we--
stop doing that!

392
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,160
- Why?
- Because I can't think.

393
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,060
- We're good together.
- We aren't. You have to go home.

394
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,560
- Come back with me.
- You're insane.

395
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,250
I'm not going back--

396
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,480
I'm not going back to new york.

397
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,220
'Cause it was just about sex?

398
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,700
Okay.
Uh,well...

399
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,200
- good-bye.
- Good-bye.

400
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,050
Stevens was supposed to bein my office at 9:30.

401
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,130
Didn't show.
Did you two change your minds?

402
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,730
No,she said she was coming in.

403
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,870
I'm sure she'll track you down.

404
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,000
We nto run a C.T.
On this kid's abdomen.

405
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,680
This superhero stuff's way out of hand.

406
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,930
It's all right if she thinks she's a superhero.

407
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,260
I believed in santa claus till I was 11.

408
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,110
Really?

409
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,490
Did santa ever hit you in the gut with a basebalbat?

410
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,830
Hey,lab's good?

411
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,320
Yeah,they're all clear.

412
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,020
so why does a guy have four ortho surgeries in one year?

413
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,060
Because he's a serious athlete.
His body takes a beating.

414
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,280
Maybe his body can't handle it.

415
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,040
Do you know how many triathlons the guy's done?

416
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,370
Right,he's 55.

417
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,180
Do you think an ankle replacement and 26 miles a day is still a good idea?

418
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,420
Um,what,do you think we should fit him for a walker?

419
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,240
He's pounding the crap out of his joints,
and he's asking you to clean it up.

420
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,990
Do you know how many hips I replace because people
can't be bothered to walk around the block once a month?

421
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,670
Sometimes,we can make dreams come true.
It's not all the often.

422
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,640
When we can,we should.
Don't you think?

423
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,670
Yeah,yeah.

424
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,440
George,don't worry about it.

425
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,690
Hey,I was gonna go home for lunch.

426
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,470
You wanna come?

427
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,810
Callie just called my house "home."

428
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,240
- Where does she get that?
- Shh.

429
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,180
It is not her home.

430
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,980
What are you doing?

431
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,450
Meredith and finn.

432
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,480
50 dn on whether shepherd shows up to challenge finn to a duel.

433
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,110
Oh,can I be,uh,with 5?

434
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,870
That's not a bet.
That's milk money,dude.

435
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,480
oh,and she's laughing because he made
a joke which probably wasn't funny.

436
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,430
"oh,you funny vet."

437
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,320
I left the rest of my cash at home,

438
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,280
which I can call it because I live there.
I'm not a visitor.

439
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,890
Hey,you're a loser.

440
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,590
You like comic books,right?

441
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,690
No.

442
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:49,140
I got this kid,this patient.
She thinks she's a superhero.

443
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,340
- What's up with that?
- Superhero?

444
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,840
Well,superheroes look like anyone,like you or me.

445
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,910
Maybe they're not someone that people necessarily

446
00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:00,870
notice as extraordinary,maybe in their daily life,
they get walked on,but then there's a moment--

447
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,120
they get hit by a cosmic ray or bitten by a radioactive spider,

448
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,610
and then suddenly,something that has been inside them all this time,

449
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,270
lying dormant,comes raging out--

450
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,890
dude,forget I asked.

451
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,850
Oh,here we go.
Here we go.Okay.

452
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,160
Come on,come on,come on.

453
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,440
takes it like a man...

454
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,850
and walks away.

455
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,440
- Thank you.43...
- he's comin' back.

456
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,400
Oh,yeah.
Oh,yes,he is.

457
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,920
Give me my money,mary jane.
Let it go.

458
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,890
Oh,god.
I'm so sorry about this.

459
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,620
- What?
- Hi.

460
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,640
- You're having lunch?
- In fact,we are.

461
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,860
Oh,it looks good.You know,I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I'm doing a corpus callosotomy.

462
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,040
- Thought you might like to scrub in.
- Are you serious?

463
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,120
- When?
- I'm gonna guess now.

464
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,170
Look,if you're busy,don't bother,but,you know,
it's not something that happens every day.

465
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,270
He's cutting a man's brain in half.

466
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,960
I'm sorry.
I'm an intern and...

467
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,670
I have a lot to learn.

468
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,340
Apparent so do I.

469
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,550
It's okay.

470
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,700
Oh,shoot.

471
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,230
- I'll call you tonight.
- Oh,you're busy tonight.She has a date.

472
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,720
- I'm sorry,finn.
- It's okay.Go.

473
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,470
Take care.

474
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,830
- I think I owe you another 50.
- Yeah,I think you do.

475
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,340
Coming or going?

476
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,770
I don't know.

477
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,250
Me neither.

478
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,820
That was brilliant,really.

479
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,360
I thought so,yes.

480
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,600
It wasn't because now I owe finn another date.

481
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,470
That's okay.
He needs all the help he can get.

482
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,110
This isn't gonna be easy for him.

483
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,190
Oh,you think he can't take the heat?

484
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,830
I think he's out of his league.

485
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,320
But you gotta hand it to the guy for trying.

486
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,550
This is Mr. Tresselt.

487
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,950
Prep him.

488
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,420
I thought you said we were operating.

489
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,700
We orate at 4:00.
I'm not just gon slide you into the O.R.

490
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,800
You gotta work a little,too,right?

491
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,970
How much is this gonna cost my parents?

492
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,210
That's not something you need to be worrying about.

493
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,020
But this is so stupid.
I'm fine.

494
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,590
Hey,pun me in the stomach,right here.

495
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:47,060
Stop telling people to punch you in the stomach.

496
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,150
You need to lie down and not move.

497
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,290
Which of the superfriends can do that?

498
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,570
Hi,miranda.
You needed a consult?

499
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,290
Yeah.
Just waiting for a picture.

500
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,710
haven't seen you since you were sucking down martinis at joe'S.

501
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,820
Oh,yeah. That was just--
well,I'm-- I'm over that.

502
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,850
Good.

503
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,990
- We talked about,uh--
- a lot of things.

504
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,060
- And I remember--
- none of them.

505
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,650
- Is that for the best?
- I think so.

506
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:19,480
She came in for sutures,but she's a walking accident

507
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,100
and has got an off-the-charts pain threshold.

508
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,810
- I'm thinking--
- chronic insensitivity to pain,yeah.

509
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,900
I've seen it in babies.
It's usually diagnosed young.

510
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,110
But...

511
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,630
if she's been bounced around in the foster care system--

512
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,600
Dr. Bailey,what the hell is that?

513
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,180
Dr. Burke.

514
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,740
- Oh,o'malley,how are you?
- Good.How's your arm?

515
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,430
Good,good.
Slow.

516
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,780
P.T.,You know.

517
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,650
Yeah.
Well,uh,we all miss you around here.

518
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,730
You're missed.

519
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,850
Hey,o'malley.

520
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,200
Stevens is standing outside the hospital.

521
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,980
I am retracting the right hemisphere.

522
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,070
What do we want to avoid?
Grey?

523
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,650
We want to avoid retractors on the sagittal sinus.

524
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:19,900
That's right.
Why?

525
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,390
To prevent sinus thrombosis.

526
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,880
Excellent.

527
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,170
Saw Dr. Burke today.
He looked good.

528
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:27,980
Yeah,he looks great.
He was meeting with the chief.

529
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,500
- Working out the leave?
- The what?

530
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,910
His leave of absence.

531
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,260
His what?

532
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,580
you've been standing out here for a while.

533
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,200
For a while,I stood over there.

534
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,910
- Maybe u should sit down.
- I don't want to sit down.

535
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,370
- Maybe you should sit down anyway.
- Go inside,george.

536
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,160
Izzie,seriously this is--

537
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,900
I hate the bride thing.

538
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,790
I hate the pictures in the magazines of the girl with the veil

539
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:03,300
and the flowers that she's sniffing like it
never occurred to her to stick her nose in there

540
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,460
until there was a camera pointed at her.

541
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,820
I hate the idea of bridesmaids and the colors and

542
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,270
"does the bustle make my ass look bigger or smaller?"

543
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:15,150
I hate the whole thing,and i never wanted to be that girl.

544
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:18,050
That girl is stupid and shallow.

545
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,720
Why the hell is that girl's thoughts running through my head?

546
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,880
Izzie...

547
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,640
I'm going to do it,george.
I'm going to walk through those doors.

548
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,810
I just need to make sure that when I'm standing in front of the chief of surgery,

549
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,550
I am not thinking about my wedding dress.

550
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,940
And that's gonna take another minute.

551
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,880
And with surgery of this kind,
there's always risk of an infection if the bone is compromised--

552
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,540
blah,blah,blah,I could die on the table.

553
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,040
Where do I sign?

554
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,340
I think we should talk through the rest of this consent form first.

555
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,750
Fourth surgery in a year--
I know the routine.

556
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,810
When I come back in for my hip,you can give me the speech in french.

557
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:09,500
- You're having hip surgery?
- In the fall,after patagonia.

558
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,600
Do you still want to meet your guy?

559
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,590
Megan's bleeding internally.

560
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,290
what?

561
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,390
It appears there's some severe trauma to her abdomen.

562
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:28,890
If you're trying to ask us if we hit her,
we've said ten times and in ten different ways--

563
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:33,510
social services cleared you,
and I'm sorry that we suggested you were mistreating her.

564
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,890
But she's hurt pretty badly,so we're gonna need to operate.

565
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,690
Oh,my god.

566
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:43,460
megan may have a chromosomal condition that
causes her to not feel any pain when she's injured.

567
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,990
It would explain why she gets hurt so often.

568
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,740
We need to do some genetic testing before we can be sure,

569
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,950
but let's assume she'll need to be monitored very closely from now on.

570
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,090
We got O.R. Three.

571
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,920
So surgery is the only option?

572
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,290
I think it is.

573
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:01,350
I-I know you've been put through the wringer already today,

574
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:04,670
but I need to ask you to trust me on this one.

575
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,530
Where is she?

576
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,120
Where's megan?

577
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,820
She's over...

578
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,960
hey,a leave of absence?

579
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,870
Yeah,I'm on my way home.

580
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:22,110
I was just making some notes for the chief
so he can reassign my open cases.

581
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,490
Because you're taking a leave of absence?

582
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,330
Okay,that's,like,what,a week?

583
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,740
As long as it takes.

584
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,020
Well,it's not gonna take that long.

585
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,140
You're already three weeks into P.T.
Already,so--

586
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:38,030
come on,recovery from brachial plexus surgery
is measured in months,cristina,years,not weeks.

587
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:41,320
The surgery's considered a success when the patient can flex the elbow.

588
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,420
Some patients never move their shoulder again.

589
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:48,470
Some don't recover sensation,
they don't recover dexterity,they simply don't recover.

590
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,850
Yes,but you are not one of those.

591
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,280
Really?

592
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,550
Says who?

593
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,030
Thanks,carl.

594
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,420
That's my guy?

595
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,250
No,that's not him.
That's someone else we lost last night.

596
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,300
He came in for lipo.

597
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,190
He died on the table.

598
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,980
Complications.

599
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,710
Didn't know they did liposuction on men.

600
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,220
People do a lot of stuff they don't need.

601
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:32,500
And,uh,the older you get,it's,uh...

602
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,390
here he is.

603
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,480
That's your guy.

604
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,010
That can't be my guy.
He's really old.

605
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,680
His bones are probably brittle.

606
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,810
What are they doing using a guy that old as my donor?

607
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,500
He's two years younger than you are.

608
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:02,410
What the hell happened to my ankle allograft?
I had O.R. 2 at 3:00.

609
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,120
Anybody wanna tell me ere it went?

610
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,030
It was canceled.
The guy went home.

611
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,600
Why the hell would he do that?

612
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,160
- Hey!
- O'malley!

613
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,530
We've lost supergirl,and she's bleeding into her abdomen.

614
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,300
Start looking in cners.

615
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,080
Do you think you cut enough of the fibers out
or are you gonna have to go back in?

616
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,410
We'll see if the seizures are under control.
If not,we'll go back in for the last third.

617
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:26,000
Well,do I get to scrub in on that,too,or only
if I'm in the middle of a date with somebody else?

618
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,930
I wodn't consider a meal in the cafeteria a date.

619
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,780
Don't denigrate the competition.

620
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,330
I have nothing but respect for Dr. Dandridge.

621
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,710
It shows courage to woo a woman with a tuna salad.

622
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:37,100
Keep an eye on taylor.
If there's a problem,page me.

623
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,850
I'll see you in the lobby at 8:00.

624
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:41,150
Hey,grey,I lost a kid.

625
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,360
Help me look for her before she bleeds out in one of our bathrooms.

626
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,630
- What's her name?
- Megan!

627
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,050
It's not easy.
If you think you're a superhero,

628
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,100
you're not gonna let someone come at you with a knife.

629
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,170
There's no way to tell what it can do to your powers.

630
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,680
I mean,if you take away green lantern's ring,

631
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,880
hal jordan is still a hero,but it creates a crisis of confidence...

632
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,880
- come on,megan.
- When you've worked hard to hone your strength.

633
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,110
Hey,just look at,uh,batman.

634
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:05,890
Robin just marches into the batcave,
and he says,you know,

635
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:10,260
"here I am.I'm gonna live here,too.
Give me some tights,and I'm taking your towel."

636
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:14,070
I mean,batman,he fought for his powers,you know?

637
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,200
He honed his strength.

638
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,350
Dude,if you don't stop this,
I'm gonna punch you in the face.

639
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,690
O'malley.

640
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,240
Good luck with that.

641
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,660
I arrange for you to see an incredibly cool surgery,
and you talk my patient out of it?

642
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,090
- No,I didn't--
- you asked me what I thought,

643
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:31,080
you didn't like what I said,so you went behind my back.
Jasper's gone.He canceled the surgery.

644
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,440
I expressed an opinion.I suggested that,you know,
not everything has to go at warp speed.

645
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,680
It is all warp speed with you.
It is all,"oh,your ankle hurts? Let's cut if off."

646
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,210
You intimidated my patient.
You got a problem,you bring it to me.

647
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,460
I'm not ready for us to move in together.

648
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,700
And if you weren't toddler,if you could use your words,

649
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,230
then maybe you could've said that the first four times I asked you.

650
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,930
And then I would've said,"oh,that's funny,me neither.
I'm looking for a place.I'll be out in a week."

651
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,950
Really?

652
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,820
- Because remember,you--
- george,save it.I'll be--

653
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,620
I'll be out in an hour.

654
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,210
Megan.

655
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,850
Megan.

656
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,360
Megan.

657
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,720
Hi.

658
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,010
Weren't you just up on three?

659
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:19,680
I was.
We lost a patient,a little girl,and I was just--

660
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:24,060
look,why don't you pick a floor and stay on it,
and I'll pick a floor on stay on that?

661
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,990
Because I really need a moment or two without you.

662
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,670
Your face shows up in my head,your...

663
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,930
panties show up in my husband's pocket--

664
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:36,200
really,you're everywhere--
and I need a moment or two without you.

665
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,110
I get that.

666
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,720
Thanks.

667
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,760
megan.

668
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:47,890
Come on.
Enough already.

669
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,690
We got half the hospital looking for you.

670
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:58,440
Your powers of invisibility are well intact.

671
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,750
Get up.

672
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,110
You're a hosebag,you know that?

673
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,990
- And you have a potty mouth.
- Nobody's cutting me open.

674
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,680
Hey,it's surgery.
We do it all the time.

675
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,550
In fact,it's all we do.

676
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:10,700
You can't keep telling my foster parents I'm defective.

677
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:13,120
They can't afford surgery.
It's too expensive.

678
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,230
They can handle it.

679
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,350
They'll send me back.

680
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,720
Dude,that's stupid.

681
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,190
They got their own personal superhero.

682
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,170
Nobody sends back a superhero.

683
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,310
I thought you said I didn't have superpowers?

684
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,650
Yeah,well,you don't.

685
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:34,860
But take away green lantern's ring,
the guy's still a hero,right?

686
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,930
Okay.
Close your eyes.

687
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,740
Squeeze 'em tight.

688
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,720
Good. Okay.
Can you squeeze my fingers?

689
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,360
Fantastic.

690
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,490
Let's wiggle your toes for me,please.

691
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:52,060
Very good,vy good.
Flying colors.

692
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,710
He's always tested well.

693
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,680
I kicked ass on the,uh...

694
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,200
what--
what's it called?

695
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,410
The S.A.T.S.

696
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,330
Now can you tell me,whatthis?

697
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,610
Honey?

698
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,630
Take your time.

699
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:18,110
Honey,what's that called?
It's right in front of you.

700
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:22,830
Can you see this here?

701
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:26,180
I can see it.
I-I just can't think of the...

702
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,950
that's all right.
It's okay. Take your time.

703
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,570
See,sometimes the names of things are tough.

704
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,250
So try again.

705
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,950
What's my name?

706
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,540
I can't...

707
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,240
wh-what's his name?

708
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,010
I-I know what it is.
I-I-I just...

709
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,540
- what's his name?
- Leanne,let's just give him a moment.

710
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,970
It...

711
00:35:59,030 --> 00:35:59,920
what's his name?

712
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,700
I...

713
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,980
he named the baby. He named him after his father.

714
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,960
How do you not know the name of your own baby?

715
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,780
Well,he knows who the baby is.

716
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:19,330
See,the right side of the brain senses emotional connection to the baby.

717
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:23,050
It just can't communicate with the left brain where the words are formed.

718
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:26,740
The pathway to the two sides has been compromised.
He needs to make new pathways.

719
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,560
How long is that gonna take?

720
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,230
Well,he'll get there.
Recovery is hardork.

721
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,650
It's a learning process.

722
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,620
You need to be patient.
You need to help him.

723
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,310
he can't do this without your support.

724
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:43,020
man,she wasn't kidding about the baseball bat.

725
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,650
I need more lap pads.
Just keep 'em coming.

726
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,060
Are you gonna resect the liver?

727
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,520
I need to try and do a debridement.

728
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,290
Look at this.

729
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:55,680
Everybody wants a life without pain,d what does it get you?

730
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,250
She needs to be on a poster somewhere

731
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,410
to remind people pain's there for a reason.

732
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:23,710
Megan's stable.
I ordered a repeat h&h in two hours.

733
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,620
She been outhere all day?

734
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,780
Dinner was good.

735
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,690
Dinner was excellent.

736
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,850
- Are you coming in?
- I don't know.

737
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:41,060
Am I?

738
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,230
Well,you could come in for a drink or a-a coffee.

739
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,380
I owe you one from this morning.

740
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,700
Yeah,you do.

741
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,320
hi.

742
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,320
Finn.

743
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,120
I didn't think you guys would be here.
I just wantedto drop this off.

744
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,850
It's strawberry ice cream.
A patient made it for me.

745
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:56,910
Patient's owner.

746
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,710
It's made from scratch.
Real strawberries.

747
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,180
I love strawberry ice cream.

748
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,810
- And he remembered.
- I did.

749
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,210
I just thought I'd leave it by the door.

750
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,440
- Oh,you didn't think it would melt?
- No,you take your chances.

751
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,800
- Worked out for you.
- What exactly is going on here?

752
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,720
- He's crashing our date.
- Where do you think I got that idea?

753
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,190
I didn't crash your date.
It was professional.

754
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,760
- You can't operate without her?
- I certainly operate well with her.

755
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,370
Enough.
This is not dating.

756
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:19,520
I want moonlight and flowers and candy

757
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,000
and people trying to feel me up.
Nobody is trying to feel me up.

758
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,190
Nobody is even looking at m I'm an intern.

759
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:30,130
Do the two of you have any idea
how much effort it takes to do all this?

760
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:32,680
I'm waxed and plucked,and I have a clean top on.

761
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,690
And the two of you are looking at each other.

762
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:35,600
- Meredith,it's--
- no!

763
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,550
- My fantasy is not two men looking at each other.
- We didn't--

764
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:41,760
no talking until one of you figures out how to put on a date.

765
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,750
I want heat,I want romance.

766
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,360
Damn it,I wanna feel like a freakin' lady!

767
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,070
The fantasy is simple...

768
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,740
pleasure is good...

769
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,760
I'm in room 22-something--
2214.

770
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,330
- If anyone calls,I'm not here.
- Yes,ma'am.

771
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,980
And twice as much pleasure is better...

772
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:08,720
hi.
Checking in,please.

773
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,350
certainly.
Room for...

774
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,710
one.

775
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,190
That pain is bad...

776
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,480
room 1817.
Any messages?

777
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,190
And no pain is better.

778
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,180
Checking in,please.
Room for one.

779
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,880
Something on the 22nd floor if you've got it.

780
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,360
I'll take a look.

781
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,280
Dr. Sloan?

782
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,350
Dr. Webber.

783
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,040
What are you doing in seattle?

784
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,490
I don't know.

785
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,260
I have a thing for ferry boats.

786
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,370
But the reality is different.

787
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,160
- Are you cooking for me?
- I am not.

788
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,940
You can take a leave of absence if you want to,

789
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,730
but you're not gonna sit on your ass all day.

790
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:58,960
You're gonna work hard and you're gonna get
every bit of your strength and dexterity back.

791
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:00,690
Really?

792
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,680
How?

793
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,430
Put it back together.

794
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,150
The reality is that pain is there to tell us something.

795
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,940
- Iz.
- I'll do it.

796
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,420
- Izzie.
- I can do it,alex.

797
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,190
I know I can.

798
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,250
does it hurt?

799
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,620
Yeah.

800
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:41,610
Where does it hurt?

801
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,000
Everywhere.

802
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:52,210
Maybe it hurts for a reason.

803
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,730
Come on.
Let's go.

804
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,490
And there's only so much pleasure we can take
without getting a stomachache.

805
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,670
And maybe that's okay.

806
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,110
Hey.

807
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,580
I didn't go in today.

808
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,670
Maybe tomorrow.

809
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,650
Hey,george.

810
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,670
Callie moved out,which is a relief.

811
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,060
Oh,I am so relieved.

812
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:43,910
Strawberry.

813
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:52,860
It's good.

814
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,160
You left spit on the spoon.

815
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,250
- No,I didn't.
- You did,a little.

816
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:03,110
Maybe some fantasies are only supposed to live in our dreams.
