1
00:00:03,531 --> 00:00:03,921
Who's Mark?

2
00:00:04,407 --> 00:00:06,352
Derek found us in bed together.

3
00:00:06,746 --> 00:00:07,721
You are in love with me.

4
00:00:08,364 --> 00:00:10,535
I'm well off, but I'm not into money,
and I'm hot.

5
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:14,871
I'm a catch. You know, if you can wrap
your head around the enlarged, failing heart

6
00:00:15,064 --> 00:00:16,475
and the dependency to I.V. Meds.

7
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:19,266
- I'm not ready for us to move in together.
- I'll be out in an hour.

8
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,302
An hour ago, he was proposing.

9
00:00:21,846 --> 00:00:24,795
- Are you gonna tell Shepherd about...
- Not yet.

10
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:28,162
If I haven't made a decision by the
end of the day, I'm flipping a coin.

11
00:00:28,622 --> 00:00:30,268
A girl can only hold out for so long.

12
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:31,694
<i>Grey's Anatomy - Episode 304</i>

13
00:00:32,216 --> 00:00:33,113
<i>"What I Am"</i>

14
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,661
<i>At some point during surgical residency,</i>

15
00:00:42,217 --> 00:00:44,813
<i>most interns get a sense of
who they are as doctors</i>

16
00:00:45,548 --> 00:00:47,213
<i>and the kinds of surgeons
they're going to become.</i>

17
00:00:48,938 --> 00:00:50,473
<i>If you ask them, they'll tell you--</i>

18
00:00:51,258 --> 00:00:52,511
<i>they're going to be general surgeons...</i>

19
00:00:54,765 --> 00:00:55,703
<i>orthopedic surgeons...</i>

20
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,441
<i>neurosurgeons...</i>

21
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:02,191
<i>distinctions which do more than
describe their areas of expertise.</i>

22
00:01:03,256 --> 00:01:04,530
<I>They help define who they are.

23
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:07,160
<i>Because outside the operating room,</i>

24
00:01:07,596 --> 00:01:09,913
<I>not only do most surgeons
have no idea who they are,

25
00:01:11,016 --> 00:01:12,321
<i>they're afraid to find out.</i>

26
00:01:19,835 --> 00:01:20,463
Time me.

27
00:01:20,927 --> 00:01:21,783
I've been timing you.

28
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,111
My last time was off by six seconds.

29
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,381
Well, it's not about speed,
it's about accuracy.

30
00:01:27,606 --> 00:01:28,751
I mean, your sutures are fine.

31
00:01:28,945 --> 00:01:32,130
My sutures are textbook.
The edges are perfectly aligned.

32
00:01:32,457 --> 00:01:34,041
Mm-hmm. You're ready.

33
00:01:34,607 --> 00:01:37,033
- I need more chickens.
- No more chickens, okay?

34
00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:39,932
It's bad enough that Meredith is dating
a vet. I'm not dating a chicken surgeon.

35
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:43,462
Stop second-guessing.
It's not like you.

36
00:01:44,608 --> 00:01:47,022
Your hand is fine, and Shepherd
will clear you for surgery.

37
00:01:52,496 --> 00:01:54,363
- Cristina.
- Yeah, baby?

38
00:01:57,656 --> 00:01:58,213
- Nothing.

39
00:02:10,928 --> 00:02:13,163
So Izzie left the house this morning.
That's a good sign.

40
00:02:14,127 --> 00:02:17,071
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm just not feeling like myself.

41
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:20,181
O'malley seems to have that
effect on women. Ask Dr. Torres.

42
00:02:21,096 --> 00:02:24,062
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Dude... You threw her out on her ass.

43
00:02:24,285 --> 00:02:24,891
I did not.

44
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:25,840
Who told you that?

45
00:02:26,767 --> 00:02:27,273
Torres.

46
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,293
- Oh...
- Don't worry. I get it.

47
00:02:30,448 --> 00:02:31,601
She's hot, but she's not for you.

48
00:02:32,266 --> 00:02:32,963
Why is that?

49
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:34,820
- Because she's hot.
- Mm.

50
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:36,912
- Callie.
- Mnh-mnh.

51
00:02:37,045 --> 00:02:38,641
Hey, come on. Wait.

52
00:02:38,997 --> 00:02:40,563
Before you start yelling, you were right.

53
00:02:41,756 --> 00:02:43,390
I should have told you how
I felt about you moving in,

54
00:02:44,517 --> 00:02:46,283
not that you were moving in. It's just,

55
00:02:46,737 --> 00:02:51,941
I'm not good at the whole...
"talking about feelings" thing.

56
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:53,492
I bet you told Meredith how
you felt, though, didn't you?

57
00:02:53,788 --> 00:02:54,552
And Izzie--

58
00:02:54,686 --> 00:02:56,382
you don't seem to have any trouble
talking to them, George, but me--

59
00:02:56,605 --> 00:03:00,801
Let's go, people. I've been in surgery
since 2:00 A.M. I'm in no mood.

60
00:03:01,186 --> 00:03:01,612
George.

61
00:03:05,047 --> 00:03:05,891
I miss you.

62
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:12,352
No cutting. No cutting.
- Yang, you're late!

63
00:03:12,606 --> 00:03:14,433
Hey, I got here before George.
- I'm here. I was here.

64
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:16,342
Nice of you to join us, Yang.

65
00:03:16,837 --> 00:03:19,171
Yeah, what are you smiling about?
Aren't you supposed to be on the gynie brigade?

66
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:19,750
Yeah, whatever.

67
00:03:21,276 --> 00:03:22,001
Woman troubles?

68
00:03:22,476 --> 00:03:23,671
Oh. Men troubles.

69
00:03:23,816 --> 00:03:25,950
I think this dating two guys
thing is getting to me,

70
00:03:26,288 --> 00:03:26,951
the stress of it.

71
00:03:27,315 --> 00:03:28,962
Finn, Derek, Derek, Finn.

72
00:03:30,118 --> 00:03:31,181
I think I'm getting an ulcer.

73
00:03:31,655 --> 00:03:34,201
McDreamy and The Vet are making you sick?
- I just need to make a choice

74
00:03:34,346 --> 00:03:35,140
and get it over with.

75
00:03:35,676 --> 00:03:36,683
Shawn Sullivan, 62,

76
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:40,650
had minimally invasive bypass surgery two
days ago to remove a blockage from his L.A.D.--

77
00:03:40,757 --> 00:03:42,263
But I'm all better now.
Thank you, George.

78
00:03:42,575 --> 00:03:46,443
So what do you think, Miranda? Can I stop being
a burden to you good people and go on home?

79
00:03:46,836 --> 00:03:50,383
You need to stop interrupting the doctors, Shawny.
You just need to listen to what they say.

80
00:03:50,718 --> 00:03:54,063
I need to get back to the dealership.
They're gonna can me if I'm out too long.

81
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,410
They can't can you, sweetie. You're the best salesman they got. Come on.

82
00:03:57,516 --> 00:03:58,413
What  do you sell?
- Cars.

83
00:03:58,566 --> 00:04:00,850
My shawny could sell... anything.

84
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:02,252
Yeah, I believe he can.

85
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:06,701
What he can't sell me on is going back to
work before he gets his oxygen levels up.

86
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:09,790
So you put that oxygen
back on, Mr. Sullivan,

87
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:11,691
before I even think about
letting you out of here.

88
00:04:12,115 --> 00:04:14,803
You know, and if I do, I want your word--

89
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:17,803
nothing fried, no alcohol
and no cigarettes.

90
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:21,212
- Boy, you're tough, Miranda.
- I need your word, Mr. Sullivan,

91
00:04:21,355 --> 00:04:22,943
or I'm not gonna sign
those discharge papers.

92
00:04:23,187 --> 00:04:24,012
I give you my word.

93
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:25,732
Hmm. All right, then.

94
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,303
Mrs. Sullivan, you need to go to the
front desk to fill out some paperwork,

95
00:04:29,595 --> 00:04:31,002
and then you can take
your husband home.

96
00:04:31,865 --> 00:04:32,521
How are we doing, guys?

97
00:04:33,227 --> 00:04:35,571
She's at 8 centimeters, but the
baby's still at minus 3 station.

98
00:04:36,187 --> 00:04:37,850
So what do we do, uh,

99
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:40,272
patterned breathing, squatting?

100
00:04:40,878 --> 00:04:42,081
Dude, squatting?

101
00:04:42,297 --> 00:04:45,063
Dr. Karev, how do we normally
proceed in a situation like this?

102
00:04:45,637 --> 00:04:47,201
We monitor the baby's progress.

103
00:04:47,525 --> 00:04:49,613
If the descent stops entirely
during active labor,

104
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:51,540
we perform a c-section.

105
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,600
Not on me, you don't.

106
00:04:53,207 --> 00:04:54,742
I'm sorry, Dr. Karev, but...

107
00:04:55,006 --> 00:04:56,833
Jeff and I have a natural birth plan,

108
00:04:56,968 --> 00:05:00,753
and Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd promised us that...
-I promised that we would do what we can,

109
00:05:00,898 --> 00:05:03,842
but if your labor intensifies and the baby doesn't descend--

110
00:05:04,327 --> 00:05:06,363
Well, then we'll wait until he does, right?

111
00:05:08,717 --> 00:05:09,833
I'm not having a c-section.

112
00:05:10,365 --> 00:05:13,671
A c-section is actually the safest way...
- To what, avoid a lawsuit?

113
00:05:13,826 --> 00:05:15,082
We don't have to decide right now.

114
00:05:15,338 --> 00:05:17,823
I'm not gonna miss out on an experience
that my body was made for

115
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,412
just because it's more
convenient for you.

116
00:05:25,948 --> 00:05:26,922
You all right, Dr. Grey?

117
00:05:28,137 --> 00:05:30,363
Yeah, Dr. Bailey. I just...

118
00:05:36,165 --> 00:05:38,003
Need to make a choice is all.

119
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:42,481
Karev. Dr. Grey, I am clipping a
basilar tip aneurysm. Any interest?

120
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:51,423
Dr. Bailey, can I get...

121
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:56,451
Oh, my God.

122
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:05,573
Oh... my... God. - Oh, my God.

123
00:06:05,717 --> 00:06:07,431
Is that... McSteamy.

124
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:14,992
No, Mr. Sullivan,
don't light that!

125
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:22,412
Somebody get a fire extinguisher!

126
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:23,892
Call a code red.

127
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:33,763
Make sure he has an airway.
Sir, can you hear me? Sir?

128
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,813
No,  he's out. Hit his head.
Small hematoma in the occipital region.

129
00:06:37,186 --> 00:06:39,173
Get him to the burn unit till he's
stabilized, and then get a C.T.

130
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:43,332
- Go.
- Right away, doctor. Come on.

131
00:06:46,608 --> 00:06:47,650
- You're burning up.
- I'm fine.

132
00:06:48,018 --> 00:06:50,380
You don't look fine. You look
beautiful, but you don't look fine.

133
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:53,482
- Now I'm gonna throw up.
- Go, you have aneurysms to clip

134
00:06:55,068 --> 00:06:56,280
and surgeons to confront.

135
00:06:57,648 --> 00:06:59,292
- You're gonna be all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

136
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:00,491
- Will you look after her, please?
- Mm-hmm.

137
00:07:02,198 --> 00:07:03,190
You think I'd miss this?

138
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:07,610
- What kind of idiot lights a cigarette in a hospital?
- Apparently people do idiotic things all the time.

139
00:07:12,955 --> 00:07:14,513
Chief. Chief.

140
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:18,692
I thought you were going back to New York.

141
00:07:19,248 --> 00:07:20,290
I thought it was time for a change.

142
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,203
You can't do this. You can't be here.

143
00:07:22,615 --> 00:07:24,221
Sure I can. It was easy.

144
00:07:25,032 --> 00:07:27,128
Sublet the apartment,
sold the practice.

145
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:29,154
He is a liar and a cheat.

146
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:31,593
The man is one of the finest
plastic surgeons in this country.

147
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:34,583
His department will generate twice
the revenue neurosurgery does.

148
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:35,541
Money, that's why he's here?

149
00:07:35,757 --> 00:07:38,313
Why do you think I'm here?
- This? This is why I left you.

150
00:07:38,597 --> 00:07:39,723
I thought you left me for Derek.

151
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,833
I left New York because of him.

152
00:07:41,988 --> 00:07:44,122
He was your best friend for years.

153
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:46,090
Right up until the point where
he had sex with my wife.

154
00:07:46,245 --> 00:07:47,151
We all make mistakes.

155
00:07:50,088 --> 00:07:51,481
Holy crap! Are you pregnant?

156
00:07:58,167 --> 00:07:59,043
Oh, this is just perfect...

157
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:05,733
- An adulterous love child.
- Goes along with an adulterous sociopath.

158
00:08:08,316 --> 00:08:08,892
Meredith.

159
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,333
Unh-unh. You've done
enough already.

160
00:08:11,576 --> 00:08:12,191
Meredith.

161
00:08:13,366 --> 00:08:16,263
Oh, uh, doctor, I-I finished
filling out the paperwork.

162
00:08:16,435 --> 00:08:17,872
When do you think I can
take Shawny home?

163
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,502
Um...

164
00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:26,233
So who's the father?

165
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:27,471
I'm not pregnant.

166
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:29,721
I didn't think I was pregnant
when I was pregnant, either.

167
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:32,501
But the abdominal pain, fever
and the nonstop vomiting--

168
00:08:32,656 --> 00:08:33,740
I'm not pregnant.

169
00:08:34,338 --> 00:08:35,870
You don't know who
the father is, do you?

170
00:08:37,326 --> 00:08:40,092
It would have to be Derek's.
There's no way it could be Finn's.

171
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:42,310
You haven't had sex
with the vet yet?

172
00:08:42,547 --> 00:08:44,780
Well, you gotta get outta
that relationship, immediately.

173
00:08:46,157 --> 00:08:47,741
Oh, I can't be pregnant, can I?

174
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:50,650
- With McBaby.
- Oh!

175
00:08:51,035 --> 00:08:52,480
Was I this mean to you
when you were pregnant?

176
00:08:52,636 --> 00:08:53,730
Oh, I thought you said
you weren't pregnant.

177
00:08:53,895 --> 00:08:56,211
She's not. We'll have
to run more tests.

178
00:08:56,887 --> 00:08:58,583
In that case, can I have
some morphine?

179
00:09:02,697 --> 00:09:04,621
I want you checking the
fetal monitor every 30 minutes.

180
00:09:05,018 --> 00:09:05,583
What's the point?

181
00:09:06,287 --> 00:09:07,950
The baby's nowhere near
where it needs to be,

182
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:09,530
and you know you're
gonna have to cut her open,

183
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:10,380
so why not get it over with?

184
00:09:11,006 --> 00:09:12,503
Because it's not what the patient wants.

185
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:14,430
And it's our job as doctors

186
00:09:14,598 --> 00:09:17,762
to  balance the desires of the patient
against the risk of complications.

187
00:09:17,918 --> 00:09:19,871
So if the patient wants to have a natural birth--

188
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:22,192
so if the patient wants a
natural birth, it's not surgical.

189
00:09:22,557 --> 00:09:24,540
So why not just cut me loose
and let me in on a surgery?

190
00:09:24,728 --> 00:09:25,793
I might actually learn something.

191
00:09:25,978 --> 00:09:28,710
- Like Sloan's burn case.
- I'm going into plastics anyway.

192
00:09:28,838 --> 00:09:30,860
Do you think that Mark Sloan
has anything to teach you?

193
00:09:30,975 --> 00:09:33,090
He is just like you. He is only
looking out for himself.

194
00:09:33,226 --> 00:09:35,483
So what? Your patient's
looking out for herself,

195
00:09:35,588 --> 00:09:37,723
you're looking out for yourself
- No, I'm not, actually.

196
00:09:37,898 --> 00:09:39,012
Well, maybe you should be.

197
00:09:41,907 --> 00:09:44,330
Go. Go find Sloan.
Do whatever you want.

198
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:46,253
Just get out of my face, Karev.
Go!

199
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:57,481
- You know, I'm not saying he's a bad doctor.
- Of course not. Listen--

200
00:09:57,626 --> 00:09:59,700
I'm--I'm saying that he's,
like, a bad person.

201
00:10:00,056 --> 00:10:01,772
The man has no morality, no ethics.

202
00:10:02,028 --> 00:10:03,661
Yeah. But there's no pain,
there's no numbness,

203
00:10:03,786 --> 00:10:04,490
but, um...
- I mean,

204
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,790
The question is do we really want our
interns learning from somebody like that?

205
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:07,930
Derek, my arm.

206
00:10:08,706 --> 00:10:10,550
Yeah. Oh, it's good. It's great.

207
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:11,901
You have great
range of motion.

208
00:10:12,137 --> 00:10:13,121
I can clear you for surgery.

209
00:10:13,315 --> 00:10:15,950
- Really? You're sure?
- Yeah, absolutely.

210
00:10:16,755 --> 00:10:17,570
Complete recovery.

211
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:20,481
You're not having any problems, right?
- No. Uh...

212
00:10:21,218 --> 00:10:23,500
I-I've been doing his physical
therapy with him every night, so...

213
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:25,781
He's perfect. He's Burke.

214
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,113
Good.  Glad to hear it.
Welcome back, Dr. Burke.

215
00:10:28,557 --> 00:10:29,022
Yeah.

216
00:10:29,785 --> 00:10:31,791
Uh, Dr. Bailey wanted to know
if you still needed an intern?

217
00:10:32,118 --> 00:10:34,052
No, I'm fine.
How's, uh, Dr. Grey?

218
00:10:34,445 --> 00:10:36,371
Oh, she's not pregnant
with anyone's baby, so..

219
00:10:51,946 --> 00:10:53,600
Izzie... Good to see you.

220
00:10:56,315 --> 00:10:57,331
You want some lunch?

221
00:10:57,827 --> 00:10:58,693
I'm meeting somebody.

222
00:10:58,957 --> 00:10:59,573
Anybody I know?

223
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:01,822
Actually, I don't even know him.

224
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:03,260
You never met?

225
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:05,790
Know what he looks like?

226
00:11:06,588 --> 00:11:08,642
So for all you know, he could be an older,

227
00:11:08,837 --> 00:11:11,263
rugged, ex-marine-looking dude?

228
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:17,731
Dr. Stevens?

229
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,102
Mr. Duquette.

230
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:24,042
Please... Call me Denny.

231
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:30,940
Pretty girl.

232
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:35,221
Not Denny's type at all.

233
00:11:37,308 --> 00:11:37,820
Really?

234
00:11:39,307 --> 00:11:40,001
What was his type?

235
00:11:40,878 --> 00:11:41,570
Um...

236
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,271
Dark-haired girls, smart.

237
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,443
Uh...  well, not that you're not smart.

238
00:11:48,335 --> 00:11:49,862
You're a doctor. Obviously--

239
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:52,200
I was. I was a doctor.
I'm not anymore.

240
00:11:52,648 --> 00:11:53,371
Oh, that's right.

241
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,460
Dr. Webber said you'd quit.

242
00:11:57,486 --> 00:11:59,983
You... talked to Dr. Webber?

243
00:12:00,695 --> 00:12:01,302
Uh, yes,

244
00:12:01,518 --> 00:12:02,303
and he said that, well,

245
00:12:02,426 --> 00:12:04,290
if I wanted to hear the whole
story, I should talk to you.

246
00:12:04,428 --> 00:12:06,083
So if you don't mind, Dr. Stevens...
- Izzie.

247
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:09,202
Izzie... If you don't mind,

248
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,103
I need to hear the whole story.

249
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:18,611
Dr. Sloan.

250
00:12:20,355 --> 00:12:21,070
You my intern?

251
00:12:21,437 --> 00:12:22,742
Yeah. Uh, I'm your intern.

252
00:12:22,888 --> 00:12:23,950
My face... oh.

253
00:12:24,306 --> 00:12:25,430
No need to talk, Mr. Sullivan.

254
00:12:25,556 --> 00:12:26,573
That's gonna be painful for a while.

255
00:12:26,937 --> 00:12:27,642
My face.

256
00:12:28,466 --> 00:12:30,700
He wants to know that you can fix his face.

257
00:12:30,826 --> 00:12:32,213
He needs to know that you can fix it.

258
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,163
I'm going to remove the burned tissue

259
00:12:34,297 --> 00:12:36,762
and then bandage your face
with a dressing of live cells.

260
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:39,351
And that'll do it? His face
will be back like it was?

261
00:12:39,595 --> 00:12:41,891
Because his face was-- it's a nice face.

262
00:12:43,926 --> 00:12:44,861
He's a salesman.

263
00:12:46,187 --> 00:12:48,270
I'm gonna do absolutely
everything I can, Mrs. Sullivan.

264
00:12:49,655 --> 00:12:51,530
We'll need a neuro consult
before we operate.

265
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:54,363
Anything else? I mean, uh,
I could do debridement or, uh--

266
00:12:54,478 --> 00:12:55,673
Actually, there is one more thing.

267
00:12:56,658 --> 00:12:59,032
Bone dry cappuccino.
Make it a double.

268
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,822
You're a good friend.
- You are so high right now.

269
00:13:06,216 --> 00:13:08,793
Actually, you're my best friend
in the whole entire world.

270
00:13:09,135 --> 00:13:10,593
Now I just feel sorry for you.

271
00:13:10,886 --> 00:13:13,003
Why? Because I could die today?

272
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:15,340
This is why I hate being
around stoned people.

273
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:16,770
And if I did die today,

274
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:20,491
I'd only be remembered as the
slutty intern who dated two doctors.

275
00:13:20,607 --> 00:13:22,013
No, one doctor, one vet.

276
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:24,212
Derek, Finn.
Derek or Finn?

277
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:26,703
I'd die as the girl who couldn't
make a choice, right?

278
00:13:26,865 --> 00:13:30,271
Probably. But none of that matters,
because you'll be dead.

279
00:13:31,115 --> 00:13:34,303
Dr. Grey... You've got a
fever, high white count

280
00:13:34,435 --> 00:13:37,231
and tenderness over
McBurney's point, which suggests--

281
00:13:37,345 --> 00:13:39,072
appendicitis.

282
00:13:39,475 --> 00:13:42,601
Dr. O'malley, prep Dr. Grey for
surgery. You're scrubbing in.

283
00:13:42,766 --> 00:13:44,080
I am, in Meredith's appendectomy?

284
00:13:44,328 --> 00:13:45,080
I, uh...

285
00:13:45,238 --> 00:13:47,012
Am I the only one who remembers the last time

286
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,953
George scrubbed in on an appendectomy?

287
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,942
He almost killed the guy. Sorry, George.

288
00:13:51,157 --> 00:13:52,950
I don't have to scrub in, Dr. Bailey. I could just, uh...

289
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,212
uh... unless you want me to, which...

290
00:13:56,346 --> 00:13:58,860
no. It's not gonna happen again.

291
00:13:59,178 --> 00:14:00,461
That good enough for you, Dr. Grey?

292
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,412
You're pretty.

293
00:14:08,207 --> 00:14:09,602
George! Ice chips.

294
00:14:13,476 --> 00:14:15,711
- Hey.
- I, uh, heard Meredith's having an appy.

295
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:17,253
It wasn't my idea to scrub in.

296
00:14:17,388 --> 00:14:20,623
- I tried to get out of it.
- George... I was just...

297
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:23,833
I just thought maybe we could have
a late supper at the Archfield.

298
00:14:25,178 --> 00:14:26,393
Why would we have dinner at a hotel?

299
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:28,170
Because they bring it right to your room.

300
00:14:29,665 --> 00:14:31,160
You're staying at the Archfield.

301
00:14:31,716 --> 00:14:32,922
How--how are you affording that?

302
00:14:34,345 --> 00:14:35,742
I still have some secrets, O'Malley.

303
00:14:36,137 --> 00:14:38,842
And if you come see me tonight,
I just might show you one or two.

304
00:14:42,217 --> 00:14:43,440
I was just checking on the Sullivans,

305
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,852
and how is he doing because he...
- You are?

306
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:48,771
Dr. Bailey. We met this morning.

307
00:14:50,158 --> 00:14:52,012
I was the resident on
Mr. Sullivan's bypass.

308
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:53,781
Well, I don't need a resident on this case, so...

309
00:14:54,136 --> 00:14:55,973
Excuse me. I wasn't asking
to be your resident.

310
00:14:56,098 --> 00:14:58,243
I was asking how my patient was doing.

311
00:14:58,368 --> 00:14:59,322
He's not your patient anymore.

312
00:15:03,646 --> 00:15:06,450
Hey, so congratulations. I told you.

313
00:15:07,227 --> 00:15:09,553
- Yeah.
- What? What?

314
00:15:11,598 --> 00:15:12,981
Shepherd shouldn't have cleared me.

315
00:15:13,376 --> 00:15:14,850
Burke, you're back.
You're back and you're fine.

316
00:15:17,147 --> 00:15:18,312
- Burke.
- What?

317
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:18,971
What?

318
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:25,341
He just... shouldn't have cleared me.

319
00:15:29,205 --> 00:15:30,750
Another contraction,
Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd.

320
00:15:31,426 --> 00:15:34,631
You're fully dilated. But the
baby's only at minus 2 station.

321
00:15:35,005 --> 00:15:37,220
- He just needs more time.
- We don't have it, Rebecca.

322
00:15:37,547 --> 00:15:39,512
His heart rate's slowing
with each contraction.

323
00:15:39,627 --> 00:15:41,541
If he starts having late decels, I...

324
00:15:41,656 --> 00:15:44,540
- Is he having late decels?
- Not yet, but...

325
00:15:44,646 --> 00:15:47,981
Then stop trying to scare me into
an operation I told you I don't want.

326
00:15:48,628 --> 00:15:49,673
I have a birth plan.

327
00:15:50,877 --> 00:15:54,242
Look, I'm not-- I'm not gonna be
one of those weak-ass women

328
00:15:54,408 --> 00:15:57,602
who give all that up the minute
things start to get scary. I...

329
00:15:58,316 --> 00:16:01,422
- Rebecca... your birth plan is just that, it's a plan.

330
00:16:01,547 --> 00:16:04,172
- Jeff, get her out of here.
- Honey, I think she's just trying to be cautious...

331
00:16:04,305 --> 00:16:09,951
Just get out! Just get out!
Get out! Aah!! Get out!

332
00:16:18,535 --> 00:16:20,253
Since when do you "get out"?

333
00:16:22,038 --> 00:16:23,602
Clearly, I am not myself today.

334
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:26,823
Never would've figured
Mark Sloan to be your type.

335
00:16:27,526 --> 00:16:31,821
He's not. He's not.
What is he doing here?

336
00:16:32,565 --> 00:16:33,881
He's not supposed to be here.

337
00:16:33,997 --> 00:16:35,083
I can't have him here. I can't.

338
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:37,223
He's supposed to be
in New York. I can't--

339
00:16:38,226 --> 00:16:39,701
I can't function with him here.

340
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:41,950
I'm a professional here.
People respect me here.

341
00:16:42,058 --> 00:16:43,532
But when he's here, I'm just--I'm--

342
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:47,093
A woman who gets the hots for
man-candy and cheats on her husband.

343
00:16:47,635 --> 00:16:49,801
That is rude... and unkind...

344
00:16:50,996 --> 00:16:52,410
And completely true.

345
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,120
Oh, my god. What am I gonna do?

346
00:16:54,715 --> 00:16:57,542
For starters, you can keep your
knees closed in his presence.

347
00:16:57,786 --> 00:16:59,150
- Miranda.
- You asked.

348
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:02,563
And also, you can remember that no man--

349
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,813
not Derek, not Mark-- defines who you are.

350
00:17:14,348 --> 00:17:15,902
Well, let's see-- your complexion is flushed...

351
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:19,111
abdominal wall is tender.

352
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:22,643
Are you happy you have a boyfriend
who works in a hospital?

353
00:17:23,978 --> 00:17:28,591
You... are just one of many men that I
happen to be dating at the moment.

354
00:17:28,695 --> 00:17:29,751
Really?
- Mm-hmm.

355
00:17:29,858 --> 00:17:30,730
How many of us are there?

356
00:17:31,028 --> 00:17:35,972
Uh... well, there's, uh, you...
- Hm-hmm.

357
00:17:36,247 --> 00:17:38,472
And Finn and...

358
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:41,922
well, forgive me for
pointing out the obvious,

359
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:44,803
but I don't see any practitioners of
veterinarian medicine at your bedside.

360
00:17:45,117 --> 00:17:46,073
You would if you turned around.

361
00:17:47,797 --> 00:17:48,651
Ah, Finn.

362
00:17:49,576 --> 00:17:50,431
Derek.

363
00:17:51,296 --> 00:17:55,692
Oh,  can I just say how much it helps
that I am on drugs right now?

364
00:17:58,186 --> 00:17:59,800
- So.
- So.

365
00:18:00,515 --> 00:18:02,000
So how's life in the animal kingdom?

366
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:03,711
What about you, Derek?
Slow day?

367
00:18:06,355 --> 00:18:08,422
If you need to take off, that's...
- No, it's fine. I can stay.

368
00:18:08,836 --> 00:18:09,941
- Great.
- Great.

369
00:18:10,578 --> 00:18:13,071
- Great.
- Okay, let's get you prepped and ready for...

370
00:18:13,998 --> 00:18:17,623
- Dr. Shepherd. Dr. Finn.
- Now all my boys are here.

371
00:18:18,235 --> 00:18:21,200
You're all so handsome...
and such good kissers.

372
00:18:21,557 --> 00:18:22,220
Oh, God.

373
00:18:23,296 --> 00:18:24,041
Excuse me?

374
00:18:24,658 --> 00:18:25,502
She's on drugs.

375
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:27,603
He's an excellent kisser.

376
00:18:28,017 --> 00:18:29,552
- You two... dated?
- You didn't know?

377
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:32,413
It wasn't a date so much as a

378
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:38,092
disastrously uncomfortable sexual experience.

379
00:18:38,557 --> 00:18:40,611
Oh... I-I-- I can't be here.

380
00:18:40,868 --> 00:18:43,221
None of you can be here.
This woman is being prepped for surgery,

381
00:18:43,335 --> 00:18:44,602
which means you all need to leave.

382
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,533
- Gladly.
- Now! Not you, O'Malley.

383
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,500
Dr. Bailey, all my boyfriends are here.

384
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:51,060
Not for long. Say good-bye, Dr. Grey.

385
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,571
- I'll be here when you wake up.
- So will I.

386
00:18:52,705 --> 00:18:53,532
- Now!

387
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:05,932
What are you doing?

388
00:19:09,117 --> 00:19:10,272
What does it look like I'm doing?

389
00:19:10,725 --> 00:19:13,403
You're not in med school. You don't need
to practice procedures on a corpse.

390
00:19:14,808 --> 00:19:15,703
Better than on a patient.

391
00:19:16,028 --> 00:19:18,500
- Burke, your hand is fine.
- Right.

392
00:19:21,387 --> 00:19:23,310
Are you... mad at me?

393
00:19:23,676 --> 00:19:25,881
Hey, hey, you're mad at me?

394
00:19:30,866 --> 00:19:31,681
Forget it.

395
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,581
Just... don't worry about it.

396
00:19:34,857 --> 00:19:35,743
You have patients.

397
00:19:36,147 --> 00:19:37,403
I'm on call for the pit.

398
00:19:37,697 --> 00:19:39,523
- Cristina--
- I-I am not leaving.

399
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:48,630
Time me.

400
00:19:53,117 --> 00:19:55,551
The transplant went better than
anyone expected, and he was better.

401
00:19:55,876 --> 00:19:58,262
He was... so much better.

402
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:00,641
But Denny, um...

403
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:04,341
before the surgery, he was hooked
up to a machine called--

404
00:20:04,466 --> 00:20:05,531
you're not answering my question.

405
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:08,251
I'm trying. I-I'm getting there.

406
00:20:08,426 --> 00:20:10,331
It--it was complicated,
and his heart was--

407
00:20:10,487 --> 00:20:11,680
I don't give a damn about the medicine.

408
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,393
I know what killed my son.

409
00:20:17,928 --> 00:20:21,243
He had a bad heart. He had a bad
heart for a long time. I get that.

410
00:20:22,037 --> 00:20:26,390
What I don't get... is how a girl like you
goes from being my son's doctor to-

411
00:20:26,897 --> 00:20:30,021
to his fiancée on the very day he's
supposed to get a new heart.

412
00:20:31,056 --> 00:20:34,811
What I don't get is how you got him to
propose to you hours before he died.

413
00:20:37,645 --> 00:20:38,270
Mr. Sullivan,

414
00:20:39,225 --> 00:20:41,751
I'm gonna recommend a night
of observation in the I.C.U.

415
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,353
Before Dr. Sloan proceeds with your surgery. - Oh.

416
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:46,460
Is that really necessary, Dr. Shepherd?

417
00:20:48,925 --> 00:20:50,642
The longer we wait, the higher the risk of infection.

418
00:20:51,086 --> 00:20:53,362
I think it's important that we attend to
potential life-threatening injuries

419
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:55,632
before moving on to cosmetic, Dr. Sloan.

420
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:58,281
He's not here for a face-lift, Derek.
He's a burn victim.

421
00:20:58,407 --> 00:21:00,471
Why did you ask for a consult if you've
already established a course of action?

422
00:21:00,605 --> 00:21:02,060
Because I thought you were good enough at your job

423
00:21:02,158 --> 00:21:03,512
to put aside the personal and do
what's best for the patient.

424
00:21:03,627 --> 00:21:05,143
My job? You're telling me how to do my job?

425
00:21:05,257 --> 00:21:06,063
Now you're telling me how to do my--

426
00:21:06,186 --> 00:21:08,692
Please, I'm sure it's complicated. And I know
Shawny's sorry for lighting that smoke.

427
00:21:08,898 --> 00:21:11,350
He was trying to keep his
word to Dr. Bailey.

428
00:21:11,565 --> 00:21:14,502
He told her he wasn't gonna smoke
when he got home, and he was...

429
00:21:15,486 --> 00:21:16,670
Just trying to keep his word.

430
00:21:17,488 --> 00:21:18,531
He knows he did wrong.

431
00:21:19,735 --> 00:21:24,442
But he'd... he's a salesman. That's who he is.

432
00:21:25,147 --> 00:21:26,733
So could you please just fix his face?

433
00:21:27,628 --> 00:21:28,972
Could you do that for us, please?

434
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,842
If what happened between me and
Addison is so unforgivable,

435
00:21:38,637 --> 00:21:40,433
how do you justify what happened
between you and Meredith?

436
00:21:40,575 --> 00:21:41,610
What the hell are you talking about?

437
00:21:41,907 --> 00:21:43,162
You need me to be the bad guy? Fine.

438
00:21:43,638 --> 00:21:45,222
But I'm not the only bad guy here, Derek.

439
00:21:45,365 --> 00:21:47,182
You and me, we're the same.

440
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:57,762
Addison. Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd.

441
00:21:59,677 --> 00:22:01,402
You bellowed, Dr. Grey.

442
00:22:01,897 --> 00:22:04,152
- Hi.
- You certainly are, aren't you?

443
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:10,673
But you're not pregnant.

444
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:12,681
No.

445
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:17,701
Are you okay?

446
00:22:18,496 --> 00:22:19,231
Fine.

447
00:22:20,616 --> 00:22:22,023
How are you?

448
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:25,141
I'm trying to choose between two men.

449
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:29,271
Okay, well, good luck with that.

450
00:22:30,806 --> 00:22:32,732
How did you know
Derek was the one?

451
00:22:36,596 --> 00:22:37,363
Excuse me?

452
00:22:38,535 --> 00:22:40,192
I know you hate me and all,

453
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:42,843
and you don't owe me anything.

454
00:22:44,148 --> 00:22:49,350
Nothing. No... thing.

455
00:22:52,435 --> 00:22:53,501
What was I saying?

456
00:22:53,657 --> 00:22:54,343
Derek.

457
00:22:55,315 --> 00:22:56,001
Right.

458
00:22:58,815 --> 00:23:00,673
I want him to be the one.

459
00:23:02,377 --> 00:23:05,733
But I would know if he was the
one, right? You knew, right?

460
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:13,693
You don't...

461
00:23:15,046 --> 00:23:17,892
I didn't... know. I just...

462
00:23:20,437 --> 00:23:21,691
Derek's the kind of guy...

463
00:23:24,217 --> 00:23:25,353
I just knew he wouldn't hurt me.

464
00:23:26,987 --> 00:23:29,020
I mean, not on purpose, anyway,

465
00:23:29,188 --> 00:23:30,282
not the way I hurt him.

466
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:34,671
He hurt me...

467
00:23:36,755 --> 00:23:37,923
when he chose you.

468
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:40,773
I should've let him go.

469
00:23:42,205 --> 00:23:45,551
I should've stepped aside,
been a better person.

470
00:23:46,738 --> 00:23:48,252
I... should've...

471
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:50,480
a lot of things.

472
00:23:53,177 --> 00:23:54,192
Me, too.

473
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:55,893
A lot of things.

474
00:23:58,736 --> 00:24:00,272
I don't hate you.

475
00:24:01,937 --> 00:24:03,861
How come we never talked
like this before?

476
00:24:04,517 --> 00:24:06,820
The only reason we are
talking like this right now

477
00:24:08,106 --> 00:24:10,681
is because I know you won't
remember a single word of this

478
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,591
once the drugs wear off.

479
00:24:17,516 --> 00:24:19,083
Dr. Karev, you need to see this.

480
00:24:19,447 --> 00:24:20,562
I'm off the case.
Page Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd.

481
00:24:20,738 --> 00:24:21,462
We did, but...

482
00:24:22,908 --> 00:24:23,550
oh, man.

483
00:24:25,668 --> 00:24:26,761
Were you just
talking to Meredith?

484
00:24:27,726 --> 00:24:28,471
Yeah.

485
00:24:32,376 --> 00:24:32,941
What?

486
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:37,603
Don't, um...

487
00:24:39,698 --> 00:24:41,153
Don't hurt her again.

488
00:24:45,516 --> 00:24:47,322
- You planning on killing a woman today?
- What?

489
00:24:47,827 --> 00:24:50,332
The c-section you should've performed
on Rebecca Bloom this morning?

490
00:24:50,516 --> 00:24:52,881
At this point, it may be too
late for her and the baby.

491
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,340
Nice work, doc.

492
00:24:54,595 --> 00:24:56,202
Get an O.R. and an anesthesiologist.

493
00:24:56,305 --> 00:24:57,623
We're doing a crash
c-section right away.

494
00:25:07,935 --> 00:25:09,043
Oh! What is happening?

495
00:25:09,346 --> 00:25:11,063
Rebecca, your baby is having late decels.

496
00:25:11,235 --> 00:25:12,371
He's in distress.

497
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:14,971
We have to get you into the delivery
room and get him out right now.

498
00:25:15,187 --> 00:25:17,391
- Oh, no, please.
- This is no longer a conversation.

499
00:25:17,536 --> 00:25:20,831
I am your doctor, and I am responsible
for your life and your baby's life,

500
00:25:20,965 --> 00:25:23,650
and I'm not about to lose either
one of you, are we clear?

501
00:25:25,497 --> 00:25:28,020
You just gonna stand there,
Karev, or are we doing this?

502
00:25:29,908 --> 00:25:30,882
Mr. Duquette, Denny and I--

503
00:25:31,777 --> 00:25:33,301
he--he was my patient for months.

504
00:25:33,436 --> 00:25:35,442
And the minute he died, you quit your job.

505
00:25:35,665 --> 00:25:37,312
- Because I couldn't..
- Four years of medical school,

506
00:25:37,438 --> 00:25:38,700
now that's a whole lot of debt.

507
00:25:39,057 --> 00:25:41,293
How were you planning on
paying that back, huh?

508
00:25:41,685 --> 00:25:43,871
Did you think that Denny
would pay for everything?

509
00:25:44,405 --> 00:25:47,102
Why are you... what--
what are you talking about?

510
00:25:47,267 --> 00:25:49,062
I'm talking about protecting my son.

511
00:25:49,227 --> 00:25:50,640
Oh, where were you
when he needed you?

512
00:25:51,626 --> 00:25:53,502
Because I was there the
whole time. I was there.

513
00:25:53,627 --> 00:25:58,190
I was working 80-hour weeks,
and I was still always there.

514
00:25:59,185 --> 00:26:00,520
He had so many surgeries,

515
00:26:01,385 --> 00:26:03,772
so many procedures.
He was so scared.

516
00:26:05,248 --> 00:26:07,072
Where were you then?
Where were you?

517
00:26:07,907 --> 00:26:08,720
You may not get me,

518
00:26:09,887 --> 00:26:11,771
but you don't have to because
I don't get you either.

519
00:26:12,128 --> 00:26:15,851
- I don't get how a father abandons his dying son.
- Wait. Wait.

520
00:26:17,307 --> 00:26:21,222
Is that what he told you, that I--
that his mother and I abandoned him?

521
00:26:23,255 --> 00:26:26,340
Well... he didn't tell you the truth.

522
00:26:40,296 --> 00:26:43,321
What? What?

523
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:47,633
Oh, Burke. I thought you-- you told me--

524
00:26:47,868 --> 00:26:51,002
- I can't hold it still long enough to attach the graft.
- You told me your hand was fine.

525
00:26:51,308 --> 00:26:52,812
- I can't--
- you told me your hand was fine.

526
00:26:52,937 --> 00:26:53,821
It's not fine!

527
00:26:55,357 --> 00:26:57,211
You wanted to believe I was fine.
You wanted me to be fine.

528
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:01,223
You wanted-- I wanted-- damn it.

529
00:27:04,846 --> 00:27:09,753
My hands... are the only things that
I have that are of any value to me, to you.

530
00:27:09,998 --> 00:27:12,752
- Not to me--
- Oh, yes, to you. You want Preston Burke.

531
00:27:20,527 --> 00:27:24,562
My hands... these are who I am.

532
00:27:25,636 --> 00:27:31,531
If I can't do this, if I can't
finish this surgery, then...

533
00:27:48,716 --> 00:27:49,893
what if I hold the vessel?

534
00:27:54,126 --> 00:27:55,323
what if I hold the vessel?

535
00:27:55,866 --> 00:27:56,550
Come on.

536
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:00,202
Burke...

537
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:02,442
if I hold the vessel...

538
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:06,313
- I can attach the graft.
- Okay, so...

539
00:28:07,947 --> 00:28:09,633
I--okay, I put my hand...

540
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,052
Nobody has to know.

541
00:28:30,317 --> 00:28:33,330
Derek. Look, I know
you're mad at me,

542
00:28:33,467 --> 00:28:35,111
but Mark Sloan is
the best in his field.

543
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:37,811
Any surgical unit in this country
would be lucky to have him.

544
00:28:38,106 --> 00:28:40,452
You did what you thought was best for this hospital.
- I did.

545
00:28:43,437 --> 00:28:45,890
Uh... are you all right?

546
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:49,623
Can I ask you a... personal question?

547
00:28:52,516 --> 00:28:54,023
Why did you leave Meredith's mother?

548
00:28:58,417 --> 00:29:00,110
I could've left Adele.

549
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:03,173
I could've gone away with Ellis.

550
00:29:06,207 --> 00:29:09,000
But I would've had so much
baggage, so much guilt.

551
00:29:10,868 --> 00:29:12,600
Ellis couldn't see it, but I wasn't...

552
00:29:15,507 --> 00:29:16,883
I never would've made her happy,

553
00:29:17,677 --> 00:29:19,000
not like she deserved to be happy.

554
00:29:21,797 --> 00:29:23,451
I was a better man for walking away.

555
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,063
I loved her enough to walk away.

556
00:29:29,656 --> 00:29:31,580
Oh, oh, on the table,
keep me draped.

557
00:29:31,935 --> 00:29:34,173
Too many people have
seen me naked already.

558
00:29:34,717 --> 00:29:36,721
I'd like to keep whatever dignity I have left.

559
00:29:37,755 --> 00:29:38,453
McSteamy.

560
00:29:39,035 --> 00:29:40,552
Meredith--
- McSteamy! Whoo-hoo!

561
00:29:42,206 --> 00:29:43,662
Is that what you're calling me now-- McSteamy?

562
00:29:43,987 --> 00:29:45,983
Yeah, but I don't think you
were supposed to know that.

563
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:47,583
How's my favorite dirty mistress?

564
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:50,421
Haven't you heard? Now
I'm an adulterous whore.

565
00:29:55,695 --> 00:29:56,923
He's so beautiful.

566
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:58,790
Thank you.

567
00:29:59,196 --> 00:30:00,051
You're welcome.

568
00:30:07,977 --> 00:30:11,773
The appendix is out. Now
what do I do, O'Malley?

569
00:30:13,007 --> 00:30:16,843
You invert the stump into the cecum
and pull up on the purse strings.

570
00:30:17,267 --> 00:30:17,883
Show me.

571
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:20,323
Okay.

572
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:25,902
Where's my coffe Karev?

573
00:30:26,568 --> 00:30:28,701
I got pulled into an
emergency c-section. Sorry.

574
00:30:28,988 --> 00:30:31,373
That's too bad. I was gonna let
you scrub in on a real surgery.

575
00:30:31,928 --> 00:30:35,462
Oh, well. Maybe next time...
if O.B. can spare you.

576
00:30:36,856 --> 00:30:37,631
See ya.

577
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:43,822
Finn.

578
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:45,191
Derek.

579
00:30:45,715 --> 00:30:46,593
She's still in surgery.

580
00:30:46,776 --> 00:30:47,933
Yeah. Yeah, I figured
I'd wait for her here.

581
00:30:48,995 --> 00:30:50,612
Meredith, uh, tells me that you fish.

582
00:30:51,846 --> 00:30:52,680
She does?

583
00:30:53,076 --> 00:30:54,321
She tells me a lot of things.

584
00:30:56,707 --> 00:30:57,861
Have you been up to Cornet Bay?

585
00:30:58,778 --> 00:31:00,651
It's mostly chinook, some rockfish.

586
00:31:00,835 --> 00:31:02,341
- You fish?
- Yeah, as much as I can.

587
00:31:03,358 --> 00:31:04,492
My wife hated it.

588
00:31:05,188 --> 00:31:06,013
you had a wife?

589
00:31:06,635 --> 00:31:07,531
Yeah. She died.

590
00:31:09,005 --> 00:31:11,032
I'm sorry. I-I didn't know.

591
00:31:13,367 --> 00:31:15,430
Meredith doesn't tell you a lot of things. Only me.

592
00:31:16,238 --> 00:31:18,000
Yeah. Funny. Very funny.

593
00:31:18,818 --> 00:31:20,070
You know, when I heard that she was sick, I...

594
00:31:20,965 --> 00:31:22,470
People come through
appendectomies all the time.

595
00:31:23,787 --> 00:31:25,662
I mean, she'll be fine, right?
- Mm-hmm.

596
00:31:27,066 --> 00:31:29,063
You really like her, don't you?
- Yeah.

597
00:31:32,275 --> 00:31:33,241
You're a good guy.

598
00:31:33,635 --> 00:31:35,931
Uh, yeah, I think so. I-I hope so.

599
00:31:42,246 --> 00:31:43,131
Okay.

600
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:45,970
- See you later.
- I'll see you.

601
00:31:48,415 --> 00:31:49,861
It was doctor after doctor.

602
00:31:51,057 --> 00:31:53,532
Everybody had a--
had a different opinion.

603
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,000
Everybody had a worse opinion.

604
00:31:56,895 --> 00:31:59,483
Before that, Denny had never
been sick a day in his life.

605
00:31:59,906 --> 00:32:01,202
Before that, he had been...

606
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:05,722
You know, the...

607
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,302
The thought of having to bury your own son...

608
00:32:10,897 --> 00:32:12,862
His mother and I, we didn't--
we didn't handle it very well.

609
00:32:16,286 --> 00:32:19,870
One day, we came home and
found a note saying, uh,

610
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:23,441
he didn't want us to have to
watch him die, that he left.

611
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:29,313
We thought... we thought he
was dead all this time.

612
00:32:34,188 --> 00:32:35,020
I had no idea.

613
00:32:37,235 --> 00:32:39,051
Believe me, if I had known, I would...

614
00:32:40,118 --> 00:32:41,502
Never have let him get away with that.

615
00:32:43,948 --> 00:32:44,742
I believe it.

616
00:32:49,505 --> 00:32:51,340
I worked my way through med school.
- You--

617
00:32:51,986 --> 00:32:55,363
I paid off my debt.
- Look, I'm, uh, sorry about before.

618
00:32:55,576 --> 00:32:56,873
You--you don't have to explain--

619
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,881
I do. I do.

620
00:32:59,076 --> 00:33:00,680
You're his dad and you're
trying to protect him.

621
00:33:02,108 --> 00:33:05,391
And I want you to know that
I've paid off all my debt.

622
00:33:06,477 --> 00:33:07,441
And when I met Denny,

623
00:33:07,587 --> 00:33:08,483
I was gonna be a surgeon,

624
00:33:09,596 --> 00:33:10,671
so I didn't need his money.

625
00:33:12,126 --> 00:33:13,271
I had everything I needed.

626
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:17,400
I had everything I needed un-until, um...

627
00:33:22,536 --> 00:33:23,242
We miss him.

628
00:33:25,626 --> 00:33:26,912
My god, we miss him.

629
00:33:27,596 --> 00:33:28,420
Yeah.

630
00:33:29,386 --> 00:33:30,351
I, um...

631
00:33:32,737 --> 00:33:33,583
yeah.

632
00:33:43,137 --> 00:33:43,731
What is this?

633
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:45,291
It's for you.

634
00:33:46,278 --> 00:33:47,293
It's from Denny.

635
00:33:56,378 --> 00:33:57,682
Hey. You ready to go?

636
00:34:00,617 --> 00:34:02,312
I'm sorry I have to do this,

637
00:34:02,925 --> 00:34:03,723
but I have to go home.

638
00:34:04,495 --> 00:34:05,392
It's Izzie.

639
00:34:10,105 --> 00:34:13,601
It's always Izzie or Meredith.
It's... it's never me.

640
00:34:14,357 --> 00:34:16,653
Oh, come on. That is not true.

641
00:34:18,785 --> 00:34:20,012
Who am I to you, George?

642
00:34:20,955 --> 00:34:23,673
Am I your girlfriend? Am I somebody
you mess around with?

643
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:26,162
Do you even know?

644
00:34:29,308 --> 00:34:30,111
well, guess what.

645
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,691
Now you don't have to
bother figuring it out.

646
00:34:38,486 --> 00:34:39,532
How's he doing, Mrs. Sullivan?

647
00:34:40,195 --> 00:34:41,501
We're just getting an
update now, Dr. Bailey.

648
00:34:44,078 --> 00:34:44,900
The surgery went well.

649
00:34:45,456 --> 00:34:47,861
We removed the necrotic tissue,
applied the live cells,

650
00:34:48,135 --> 00:34:50,512
and if his body responds, in three or four weeks--

651
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:51,881
He'll have his face back?

652
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:54,913
Mr. And Mrs. Sullivan,

653
00:34:55,578 --> 00:34:58,390
Your face may never be exactly what it was.

654
00:34:59,156 --> 00:35:01,423
Even if everything goes perfectly well,
there will be scarring.

655
00:35:01,877 --> 00:35:02,802
But he's a salesman.

656
00:35:04,816 --> 00:35:06,010
He has such a nice face.

657
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:17,930
You have an incredible wife, Mr. Sullivan,

658
00:35:18,296 --> 00:35:21,793
And half a dozen car salesmen in
the lobby waiting to visit you.

659
00:35:22,626 --> 00:35:26,451
Your face may be different,
but you know as well as I do,

660
00:35:26,636 --> 00:35:27,981
it's not about what you look like

661
00:35:28,656 --> 00:35:31,552
Or your job or how successful you are.

662
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:37,081
It's about having people in your life
that you love and who love you.

663
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:41,400
That--that's all that matters.

664
00:35:51,106 --> 00:35:51,861
How you feeling?

665
00:35:52,426 --> 00:35:53,803
Oh, mortified.

666
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:57,381
I was just explaining the "Meredith
on morphine" experience.

667
00:35:57,585 --> 00:35:58,621
Ahh. You don't remember?

668
00:35:58,958 --> 00:35:59,761
Was it memorable?

669
00:36:01,856 --> 00:36:03,093
I'll let Finn tell you. I'll come back.

670
00:36:03,267 --> 00:36:03,990
No, a-actually, I've--

671
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:05,592
I've just been sent on a
mission to get the, uh,

672
00:36:05,717 --> 00:36:07,510
patient's ice chips. Be right back.

673
00:36:10,537 --> 00:36:11,930
How badly did I embarrass myself?

674
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:15,913
What?

675
00:36:25,876 --> 00:36:28,050
You deserve to be with somebody
who makes you happy,

676
00:36:29,308 --> 00:36:30,812
somebody who's not gonna
complicate your life,

677
00:36:32,496 --> 00:36:33,522
somebody who won't hurt you.

678
00:36:44,648 --> 00:36:46,573
He's a better guy, Meredith.

679
00:36:48,295 --> 00:36:49,070
Finn's the better guy.

680
00:36:52,817 --> 00:36:53,700
Derek...

681
00:36:56,906 --> 00:36:57,972
I'm walking away.

682
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:22,453
He left a message.

683
00:37:24,115 --> 00:37:25,842
Denny left a message for
his parents the night...

684
00:37:30,035 --> 00:37:33,220
His father gave me the number
and the code, but, um...

685
00:37:36,985 --> 00:37:37,760
I just couldn't do it alone.

686
00:37:48,386 --> 00:37:51,751
Addison... Can we talk?
- I don't want you here, Mark.

687
00:37:53,246 --> 00:37:55,040
I think I've made that abundantly clear. So...

688
00:37:56,725 --> 00:37:58,261
If you insist on staying, just...

689
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:02,122
Know that we're coworkers,
and nothing more.

690
00:38:06,438 --> 00:38:07,180
Karev.

691
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:11,413
As of right now, you are
officially off my service.

692
00:38:12,145 --> 00:38:13,002
But for what it's worth,

693
00:38:14,117 --> 00:38:15,091
I think you're gonna miss me.

694
00:38:19,098 --> 00:38:20,370
<i>Hello, you've reached the Duquettes.</i>

695
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:26,983
<i>DENNY : Dad, Mom, it's me.</i>

696
00:38:28,178 --> 00:38:29,832
<i>DENNY : I'm calling from Seattle Grace hospital,</i>

697
00:38:30,065 --> 00:38:35,032
<i>DENNY : where the beautiful, talented and
incredibly stubborn Dr. Isobel Stevens</i>

698
00:38:37,518 --> 00:38:39,822
<i>DENNY : has just given me a brand-new
heart and promised to marry me.</i>

699
00:38:41,775 --> 00:38:46,652
<i>DENNY : I know we've had our differences,
and I'm sorry we've been out of touch.</i>

700
00:38:47,915 --> 00:38:48,982
More chicken surgery?

701
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,091
I'm making you dinner.

702
00:38:53,196 --> 00:38:56,422
<i>DENNY : Believe it or not, I was trying to make everything better.</i>

703
00:38:57,816 --> 00:39:00,430
<i>DENNY : I know you're angry.
I hope you'll forgive me.</i>

704
00:39:02,158 --> 00:39:05,551
<i>DENNY : Turns out, sometimes you have
to do the wrong thing...</i>

705
00:39:07,085 --> 00:39:08,032
McSteamy, right?

706
00:39:09,955 --> 00:39:11,243
You must be a friend of Meredith's.

707
00:39:11,876 --> 00:39:14,722
Not really. Dr. Torres. Callie.

708
00:39:15,757 --> 00:39:16,551
Mark Sloan.

709
00:39:18,246 --> 00:39:19,522
Bad day?

710
00:39:22,165 --> 00:39:23,120
You could say that.

711
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,093
- You?
- Oh, yeah.

712
00:39:27,087 --> 00:39:29,551
So what have you heard
about me, exactly?

713
00:39:30,746 --> 00:39:34,672
Mostly things that involve
the words "dirty" and "bad."

714
00:39:35,757 --> 00:39:37,122
Right.

715
00:39:40,157 --> 00:39:42,961
I guess there, uh, really is no
starting over, is there?

716
00:39:48,025 --> 00:39:49,161
Can I buy you a drink, Callie?

717
00:40:00,077 --> 00:40:02,872
Only if you have it delivered to
my hotel room, because I'm off to bed.

718
00:40:08,826 --> 00:40:10,541
<i>DENNY :Sometimes you have to make a big mistake...</i>

719
00:40:11,645 --> 00:40:12,300
You comin'?

720
00:40:15,225 --> 00:40:16,912
<i>DENNY : To figure out how to make things right.</i>

721
00:40:17,368 --> 00:40:20,802
So what time do they let us visitors
start visiting in the morning?

722
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:26,301
You shouldn't do that.

723
00:40:27,055 --> 00:40:27,850
I don't mind.

724
00:40:28,818 --> 00:40:33,043
No, Finn. Really, you shouldn't do that.

725
00:40:45,306 --> 00:40:46,030
So it's Derek.

726
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:47,511
I'm sorry.

727
00:40:55,007 --> 00:40:55,673
Can I ask why?

728
00:40:56,275 --> 00:40:57,961
You are a great guy...

729
00:40:59,108 --> 00:41:00,302
you're a wonderful guy,

730
00:41:01,727 --> 00:41:03,570
and you may even be the better guy.

731
00:41:05,715 --> 00:41:06,443
But...

732
00:41:07,266 --> 00:41:09,621
- He's the one.
- And I wish he wasn't.

733
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:14,870
He's gonna hurt you again...

734
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:20,432
And when he does,
I won't be here.

735
00:41:27,398 --> 00:41:28,240
<i>DENNY : Mistakes are painful...</i>

736
00:41:30,206 --> 00:41:31,553
Take care of
yourself, Meredith.

737
00:41:31,988 --> 00:41:35,173
<i>DENNY : But they're the only way to
find out who you really are.</i>

738
00:41:36,795 --> 00:41:40,311
<i>DENNY : I know who I am now.
I know what I want.</i>

739
00:41:41,598 --> 00:41:45,012
<i>DENNY : I've got the love of my life...
a new heart...</i>

740
00:41:46,185 --> 00:41:50,332
<i>DENNY : and I want you guys to get on the
next plane out here, and meet my girl.</i>

741
00:41:54,686 --> 00:41:56,402
<i>DENNY : Everything's gonna be different now.</i>

742
00:41:59,045 --> 00:42:01,323
<i>DENNY : I promise, from here on now,</i>

743
00:42:02,727 --> 00:42:03,881
<i>DENNY : nothing's ever gonna be the same.</i>

744
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:07,401
<i>DENNY : I love you. Bye.</i>
