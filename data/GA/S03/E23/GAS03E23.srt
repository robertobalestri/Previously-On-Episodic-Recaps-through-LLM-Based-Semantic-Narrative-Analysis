1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I just never thought about it.

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,200
What I would do,you know?

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,900
What the dream would be if
I couldn't have my dream.

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,900
Empty office.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,100
Okay, what are we doing?I thought we were
going to lunch.Why are we still sitting here?

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,400
We're doing what I do when
I get depressed.Just wait.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,300
-What time do you have?
-It's 5 to 1:00.

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,900
You know what? I'm glad I can't have a child.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,000
With my luck, I'd probably
have a kid with two heads.

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,500
It--it's actually better.I'm grateful.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,100
I don't have to think about it.The option is...

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,300
off the table.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,700
-What time do you have?
-5 to 1:00.

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,200
You people are obsessed with time.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,700
Here he comes.

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,100
Hi, dell.

20
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,200
-Have a nice... surf.
-I'll see you guys after lunch?

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,300
oh, my god.

22
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,600
-You two should be ashamed of yourselves.
-admit it.You feel better.

23
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,800
And if not, there's another showing in an hour,

24
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,600
and it's wet.

25
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,600
My brain is bleeding?

26
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,700
How could my brain have been
bleeding since the accident?

27
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,900
Well, it could be from the trauma,

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
but it also could be from one of your surgeries.

29
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,900
Dr. Shepherd,I've been living in
this hospital long enough to know

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,300
when there's something one of you isn't saying.

31
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,200
Because of the location of the bleed,

32
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,900
you need to be awake during surgery.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,600
You'll be sedated, alert,but but it
can be a really dangerous process.

34
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,000
There's a lot about the brain we don't know.

35
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,500
So... I could potentially get my memory back?

36
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,700
Mm. It's possible.Amnesia can be a symptom,

37
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,200
but I think it's a long shot.

38
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,300
I'll do some brain mapping and see
if anything happens,but--

39
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,000
but I could.get my memory back?

40
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,800
You're back? What happened?

41
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,400
She's got a fever,
and I think I hear a small murmur.

42
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,900
-A heart murmur?
-Don't be dramatic.

43
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,600
-At least it's not the hiccups.
-Could be complications from the endoscopy.

44
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,800
Bacterial endocarditis?

45
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,400
You'll have to get tests,
and if they come back positive,

46
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,300
you'll be admitted for I.V. Antibiotics.

47
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,900
-Which should knock it right out.
-See? I told you.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Don't be dramatic.

49
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,800
Hey, hey. You're supposed to wait for me.

50
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,500
I'm going crazy just sitting there.

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,700
Hey, look,I'd be freaked out, too,

52
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,400
if somebody was about to open up my head.

53
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,200
But dr. Shepherd,he's the best.

54
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,000
I can't hold my baby, right?

55
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,600
She's--she's in that incubator.

56
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,100
And so the nurses told me
to talk to her. And I try.

57
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,200
Guess what. Right now,

58
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,400
I have nothing to say.

59
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,800
You know, I don't even remember
what it feels like to be outside,

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,200
to have the wind in my face or rain or...

61
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,600
I know the surgery is dangerous, but...

62
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,400
I'm not freaked.I can't wait.

63
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,100
Well, there's no guarantee the
surgery's gonna bring back your memory.

64
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,900
But there's a chance.

65
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,000
It's better than nothing.

66
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,800
good news.Uh, paul's lack of sex
drive comes from a hormone imbalance.

67
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,100
-So paul still likes sex?
-Yeah, well, he's a guy and he's not dead,

68
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,200
so I'm guessing yeah.He just--he
just can't do anything about it.

69
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,900
-And that's good news?
-The bad news is that

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,500
there could be many causes to this
imbalance,some more serious than others.

71
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,000
So final diagnosis and treatment
could be a lengthy process.

72
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,400
We're gonna have to run more tests.

73
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,800
So it might be a while
before paul can help kathy...

74
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,000
-take the edge off.
-Tell her to try swimming.

75
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,600
It's easier on the knees.

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,400
so...

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,700
-you're the quack.
-Uh, I went to med school.

78
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,900
I'm also a licensed herbalist,and I spent five
years in china learning alternative medicine.

79
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,100
Like I said... quack.

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,200
Come here.

81
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,500
Unless you need to go tell someone
you saw goody johnson with the devil.

82
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,400
Okay.

83
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,500
-Lie down on the table.
-Why?

84
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,800
I wanna show you that I'm not a quack.

85
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,900
I'm not taking my clothes off.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,500
Did I ask you to take your clothes off?

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,200
now...

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,300
you carry a lot of tension in your
shoulders and above your right eye.

89
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,700
What do you mean?

90
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,300
You're blocking some serious emotion.

91
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,100
Hang on.

92
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,600
What--what are you doing?

93
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,500
Stop saying "ow."It doesn't hurt.

94
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,600
-Okay, I'm done.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.Where are you going?

95
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,700
-You can't leave me here like this.
-Lie there. Don't move.

96
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,600
Breathe.You're going to
experience a rush of emotion,

97
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,900
a release of...psychic pain.

98
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,600
Hello?

99
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,100
Hello?

100
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,800
I don't feel anything...

101
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,400
except stupid for...

102
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,500
letting a cute hippie boy put needles in my face.

103
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,300
Hello!

104
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,000
Yeah, pete...

105
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,600
I...

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
this isn't working.I don't have any...

107
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,400
psychic pain.I... I'm great.

108
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,000
Barren, but...

109
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,400
fan-freakin'-tastic.

110
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,300
You can come back now.

111
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,800
I am not feeling any,you know,
rush of emotion or anything.

112
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,600
I don't feel... anything.

113
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,200
I don't feel anything at all.

114
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,300
I don't feel anything at all.

115
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
I hate L.A.

116
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,000
-Hey.
-Hey.

117
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,100
I heard susan was back.Is everything okay?

118
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,800
Oh, an infection.She'll be fine.

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,100
Oh, good, 'cause I figured if
anything was wrong,you'd tell me.

120
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,600
If it was serious, I would,
in a very "letting you in" sort of way.

121
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,100
-You know, it's weird.
-What?

122
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,100
My father--we're almost talking.

123
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,900
Really?

124
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,200
-How's the trailer?
-It's freezing.

125
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,700
you want to eat later?

126
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,200
I'll bring something over.

127
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,300
-Are you using me for central heating?
-Among other things.

128
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,200
-Okay.
-All right.

129
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,800
-Lisa?
-I think something is wrong.

130
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,700
-She's in pain.
-Lisa?

131
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,000
Addison,something is not right.Oh, my god.

132
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,600
-I think I just wet my pants.
-No, your water broke.

133
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,800
She's in labor,and it's coming fast.

134
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,600
I'll call an ambulance.Uh, go get cooper.

135
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,000
And let the hospital know
we're coming and call the chief.

136
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,700
I don't want any problems when I try to scrub in.

137
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,300
Breathe.

138
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,400
-I need to push!-Don't push.

139
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,000
Get her into labor and delivery
right away.Jim, check her in.

140
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Lisa! Is she okay?

141
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,900
-Are they okay?
-What happened?

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,500
-It's too early.
-She's not due for another month.

143
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,000
Well, I'm guessing that the stress
of you all fighting and crowding her,

144
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,200
declaring yourselves the father didn't help.Move!

145
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,500
any word on lisa and the baby?

146
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,900
we're still waiting.

147
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,500
-Therapy sucks.
-Said the shrink.

148
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,200
No, I mean my particular brand
of therapy might actually be...

149
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,000
full of crap.

150
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,100
People talking about their problems endlessly,

151
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,800
telling people to think positively,
visualize their destiny.

152
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,400
-It doesn't work?
-I think positively.

153
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,400
I visualize my destiny.

154
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,800
And look, just look.

155
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,200
-What am I lookin' at?
-Me...

156
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,400
my pathetic,miserable existence.

157
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,100
he left six months ago.He was a loser!

158
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,000
Do you know he peed a little
bit every time he coughed?

159
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,900
Like an incontinent old woman.He smelled like pee.

160
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,400
and there I was, in the car, crying,

161
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,900
and I'm a serious feminist.

162
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,700
Not to mention,my no-sex couple?

163
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,000
Turns out it was a hormone thing. It's physical.

164
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,000
In the old days we would've talked and talked
and talked as paul got sicker and sicker.

165
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,500
My profession's becoming irrelevant.

166
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,000
maybe it's a good thing.

167
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,700
People should just tell the truth
to the people in their lives.

168
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
They can'T.

169
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,400
-If they could, we'd all be healthy.
-Like me.

170
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
-You're not healthy.You're in denial.
-I am not in denial.

171
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,900
You're in denial,and you're angry.

172
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,200
You're the angriest man I know.

173
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,500
Is that why you won't sleep with me?

174
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,400
You're in denial,you're angry,

175
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,500
and you use sex as weapon to deflect it.

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,500
Oh.

177
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,100
now stimulating area 11.

178
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,500
Ava, can you name this object?

179
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,900
-Flowers, pink and blue.
-Avoiding area 11.

180
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,500
Moving superiorly.This will be area 12.

181
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,700
Una cara con los ojos azules y el pelo rubio.

182
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,200
-Was that spanish?
-Was it?

183
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,300
Okay, I'm going on to 13.

184
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,600
Il maison avec des galets rouge.

185
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,200
all right.Now you're just showing off.

186
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,100
Each language is stored in a
different area of the brain.

187
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,400
And as I stimulate them...this will be 14.

188
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,300
So this isn't from the surgery?
She actually speaks spanish and french?

189
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,200
Alex...das ist noch das haus.

190
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,100
-And german?
-She's hypoventilating.

191
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,500
Let's puther under and work on the bleed.

192
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,000
Can't we keep going just a few more minutes?

193
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,000
Maybe she can get her memory
back along with the languages.

194
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,500
If we don't control this bleed,she'll
lose a lot more than her memory.She'll die.

195
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,800
-why is this happening so fast?
-Uh, doctors?

196
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,400
Cooper, she's crowning.

197
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,700
All right,just don't push, lisa.

198
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,600
-Oh, push? Okay.
-No! No, don't push, lisa.

199
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,100
The cord's wrapped around the baby's neck.

200
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,400
Oh, I'm sorry!I can't help it!

201
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,200
God! Oh!

202
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,700
-I'll hold her.You clamp and cut.
-okay.

203
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,400
-Is she okay?
-Hang 20 of oxytocin.

204
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,800
8 french suction catheter.

205
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,000
-Why isn't she crying?
-Dr. Freedman's gonna be working on her.

206
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,800
We need to focus on your right now, lisa.

207
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,400
Fortunately, you're not bleeding that much,

208
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,000
so we should be able to remove the placenta by...

209
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,100
-by--by what? By what?
-put her under, now.

210
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
What's going on?

211
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,700
Her uterus must have ruptured
because of the placenta accreta.

212
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,400
-We have to open her up.
-No, no, no, no, no.

213
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,800
-The baby's not crying.
-B.P.'S 58 over 32.

214
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,800
-Don't put me under till the baby cries.
-We don't have time, lisa.

215
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,800
We have to put you under right now.

216
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,600
-go, addison.
-Okay.

217
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,300
Hang two units of b-positive and
make sure we have plenty on standby.

218
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,700
She's gonna exsanguinate if we
don't move quickly,people.10-blade.

219
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,900
Lisa lost a lot of blood,

220
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,600
we had to put the baby on oxygen,
but they are both stable.

221
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,800
-Who's the father?
-What?

222
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,900
You said you sent off for the paternity test.

223
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,300
-Which one of us is the father?
-Did lisa say anything,

224
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,700
her decision about the baby?

225
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,300
Lisa lost a lot of blood,

226
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,200
we had to put the baby on oxygen,
but they are both stable.

227
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,600
I say it again

228
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,500
because it seems like you
didn't hear me the first time.

229
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,500
They almost died.Lisa almost died.

230
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,800
And so I didn't have time,what,
with, um, trying to save her life,

231
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:43,300
to pause and check on the paternity test
or ask her about the baby's future.

232
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,200
What is wrong with you people?

233
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,000
-C-can--can we see the baby?
-No.

234
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,800
None of you go near lisa
or the baby until I say so.

235
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,700
The child is not a possession that you fight over.

236
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,300
And by the way,not that you asked,

237
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,400
it's a girl--6 pounds, 9 ounces.

238
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,100
I don't remember.

239
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,000
Hey.We got it, the bleed.

240
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,700
You're gonna be fine.

241
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,700
By the way, uh,you rocked that surgery.
You spoke three languages.

242
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,800
I don't remember anything.

243
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,000
The surgery was sup--

244
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,200
I th--I thought I would...

245
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,000
what am I gonna do?

246
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,100
What if... what if I never remember anything?

247
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,100
You sick, o'malley?

248
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,200
You feel fine.Take an aspirin
and get off my clean bed.

249
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,400
You been married a long time, right?

250
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,600
-O'malley, I do not have time to answer--
-did you have doubts...

251
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,100
about your marriage?I don't mean,uh, insecurities.

252
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,600
I mean really serious doubts.

253
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,400
Dr. Bailey, I need you to sign
this before I can discharge bed ten.

254
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,700
No. He's supposed to get an I.V.
Dose before discharge.

255
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Why don't people listen?

256
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,300
Someday you'll have to explain to
me how antibiotics actually work.

257
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,200
They are miraculous.

258
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,300
Good afternoon.Uh, dr. Bailey asked me to look in.

259
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,500
Everything looks good.

260
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,700
We are going to take you to
radiology to get a central line

261
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,100
-to continue your I.V. Antibiotics outpatient.
-Okay.

262
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,300
Hey, will you show your dad the cafeteria?

263
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,600
-Sure.We're on to you,you know?
-What?

264
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,200
Dr. Bailey.I was...looking for some privacy,

265
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:11,000
and, uh, I didn't think anyone would
come looking for me down here.I apologize.

266
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,500
No problem.Take your time.

267
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,100
-Uh, dr. Bailey.
-Yeah.

268
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,100
Um, you've been married a long time now, right?

269
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,000
Do you think it matters if one person...

270
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,600
-is--is more ready?
-O'malley!

271
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,000
-Yeah.
-Come here.

272
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,900
-Yes. Hi, dr. Burke.
-I want the two of you to talk to each other.

273
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,800
I want you to talk to each other
and leave my marriage out of it.

274
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,000
I also want you to leave my clinic out of it.

275
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,000
And by that, I mean get out.

276
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,900
I need the space,I need the peace,
I need the quiet, and I need it now.

277
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,200
-Sorry.
-Yeah, right, sorry.

278
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,900
cooper, you're blocking the caffeine.

279
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,800
He's blocking the caffeine.

280
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,100
Cooper, if you move,I'll give you a cookie.

281
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,100
hey, did something go wrong with lisa's surgery?

282
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,600
No, uh, we handled it.Addison--she is,

283
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,800
pretty excellent.She's pretty excellent.

284
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,900
okay, only because you've sighed twice...

285
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,200
what's the matter, cooper?

286
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,800
I don't go to hookers.I don't go to strip clubs.

287
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,500
I meet women on the internet that want to meet me.

288
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,200
So I like 'em a little
younger and a little dirtier.

289
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,200
Is that wrong?

290
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,800
It's wrong?

291
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,100
You need to meet a grown-up.

292
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,300
You need to date someone your own age.

293
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,300
Someone without a porny internet name
and--and perhaps no criminal past.

294
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,800
-A nice girl.
-A viable girl.

295
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,500
Someone with whom you can have a relationship.

296
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,700
You're a respected doctor.

297
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,600
Go out in the real world,meet a
woman your own age and ask her out.

298
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,400
Be a man, cooper.

299
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,300
Be a man.

300
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,600
there you are.

301
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,200
I just stopped by to see how
lisa and the baby are doing.

302
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,100
-you okay?
-Yeah. I just--I...

303
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,600
I had a little too much
surgery today.But I'm--I'm good.

304
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,100
you look good.

305
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,100
you look... beautiful.

306
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,700
Sam told me that I had to stay away from you

307
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,700
-because you're naomi's friend, but--
-stop it.

308
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,200
-What?
-You're flirting.

309
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,400
-What's wrong with flirting?
-What's wrong with it?

310
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,000
What's wrong?

311
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,000
What's wrong is that I don't have time for it.

312
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,000
I am... out of time.

313
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,200
I missed my chance.And now I have two eggs left.

314
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,400
I might as well have no eggs left.I am egg-less.

315
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,000
Naomi says that she's dried up?
I'm the one who's dried up.

316
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,200
I'm all barren and dried up.

317
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,700
And I have clearly been wasting my time on men.

318
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,900
I mean, I might as well take up hobbies,

319
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,100
like needlepoint or, um,
collecting those little ceramic dolls, you know?

320
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,600
Because that's what dried up women do.
They do needlepoint.

321
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,200
They do not waste their time flirting
with men who clearly just want to get laid.

322
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,700
they do not waste their time...

323
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,100
telling overly personal...

324
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,000
information about their eggs to total strangers.

325
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,700
Oh, my god. I'm sorry.

326
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,400
What are you doing?

327
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,500
I'm gonna kiss you.

328
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,900
I'm gonna kiss you with tongue.

329
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,200
I'm gonna kiss you so you feel it.

330
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
Okay?

331
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,700
Okay.

332
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,200
Why'd you do that?

333
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,400
To remind you...

334
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,200
that you're not dried up.

335
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,400
If you need me to remind you again...

336
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,700
let me know.

337
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,000
Okay.

338
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,300
-when did the cramping start?
-A little while ago.

339
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,600
-What is it? Is it--
-probably nothing serious.

340
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,500
It could just be a reaction to the antibiotics.

341
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,700
We may have to switch to another one,
but it may mean another night here.

342
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,600
It's okay, it's okay.

343
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,800
It's okay.

344
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,500
Wait.

345
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
I know--I know that you think we're awful,

346
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,600
and I think that we're awful.

347
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,200
I just, um...

348
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,800
I just wanted a baby so badly.

349
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,300
I just wanted a baby.

350
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,600
And I don't care who the father is,
I don't care if the baby's mine.

351
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,900
All that matters is the baby.
Is--is she gonna be okay?

352
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,100
Just tell me that she's gonna be okay.

353
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
She's gonna be okay.

354
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,700
Thank you.

355
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,100
You're welcome.

356
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,400
-I hear callie's going to be a bridesmaid.
-Yeah.

357
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,000
Would you, um,

358
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,100
say that you were the one that
needed more urging to get married?

359
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,600
Oh, I hadn'T...

360
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,400
really been thinking about it.

361
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,800
I--it just, uh, seemed like a good idea at the time.

362
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,300
You and cristina have been together for a while.

363
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,300
You got married pretty fast.

364
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,800
So in theory it's better
to know someone pretty well.

365
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,400
-Way better than--
-still, no guarantees.

366
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,300
I-I don'T...

367
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,400
-believe in divorce.
-Neither do I.

368
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,500
Is it possible...

369
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,500
do you think,to love two people...

370
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,100
at the same time?

371
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,300
I, uh...

372
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,100
I'm still hoping it's possible
just to love one person.

373
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,700
Hey.

374
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,000
So, uh, it's not gonna be too weird, right?

375
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,800
-Me as a bridesmaid?
-No, no, it's fine.

376
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,600
-'Cause I can tell cristina--
-I said it's fine.

377
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,600
-Really, no worries.
-So, um...

378
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,600
did george tell you he's thinking
about transferring to mercy west?

379
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,500
Yeah. Sounds like a good idea.

380
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,200
-So we're fine?
-Oh, we are. Fine.

381
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,350
Hey, that last dress was okay, wasn't it?

382
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:10,130
I mean, it was too tight and I couldn't breathe, but...

383
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,030
- A wedding's just one day, right?
- Yeah.

384
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,290
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

385
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,950
Yeah.

386
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,780
Santa Monica

387
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,940
We got Paul¡¯s M.R.I. back,

388
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,490
and I've consulted with dr. Straley at sloan-kettering.

389
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,220
We found a tumor on your adrenal gland.All right?

390
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,550
It sits right on top of the kidney,

391
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,200
and it's what's been causing your low sex drive.

392
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:35,310
So it wasn't me?
He's got a condition.

393
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:38,870
A-a tumor, that's not too...

394
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,620
You can treat that, right?

395
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:44,510
These tumors are usually aggressive and found late

396
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,520
because the symptoms are so subtle.

397
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,880
what is that mean?

398
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,310
Treatment is difficult and risky,

399
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,090
but there is hope.

400
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:57,230
Oh, my god, honey, I can't believe I yelled at you.

401
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,270
I'm so sorry.

402
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,740
It's all right, honey.
It's okay.

403
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,950
No, I'm horrible.I'm so sorry.
I love you so much.

404
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,500
Hello?

405
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,440
Hello?

406
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,520
Are you there...

407
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,320
Elevator god?

408
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,190
It's me, Addison.

409
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,810
What?

410
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,720
- Hi.
- Hi.

411
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,670
Okay, look, you may be
a figment of my imagination,

412
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,580
or maybe I'm going completely insane,

413
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,800
I don't know.Or maybe...

414
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:57,180
This is payback for my crimes on
some ginormous karmic level, I don't know.

415
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,390
I just...

416
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:05,150
I just want to tell you
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

417
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,830
Okay?

418
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,520
Okay.

419
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,510
Well...

420
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:19,230
Bye.

421
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,870
I am such a screwup...

422
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,660
In my life.

423
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:30,750
Up until now, I have been
really great at one thing.

424
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,630
I am great...

425
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,610
At being Paul¡¯s wife.

426
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,290
And I thought he didn't want me anymore.

427
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,670
I thought--I was sure that
he was in love with somebody else.

428
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,890
Of course you were.

429
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,530
I lied to Paul.

430
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:52,290
I was with a man that night
that I didn't come home.

431
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,250
I didn't even find him that attractive.

432
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,360
I just told myself that I wasn't gonna
settle for being alone, you know?

433
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,100
Kathy, you were reacting to
what was in front of you.

434
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,020
There was no way you could know
what was really going on.

435
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:09,500
What do I do now?

436
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,330
You do what you're great at.

437
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,660
You love your husband.

438
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,720
You're gonna have to tell me that a lot, okay?

439
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,920
Okay.

440
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,810
Hey, everyone else is gone.
I was heading out.

441
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,340
Uh, unless--

442
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,800
I was gonna get some food.
You want something?

443
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,270
Oh...
No.I...

444
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,640
I ate.
Thanks for asking.

445
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:55,080
Another night?

446
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,790
- Dell, are you--
- asking you out on a date?Yes.

447
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,040
- You can't ask me out.
- Yes, I can.

448
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,990
- No, you can't.
- I asked.

449
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,050
You're--you're a fetus.

450
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,080
You could be my fetus.

451
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,920
Coo coo cachoo, Mrs. Robinson.

452
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,460
You can't use "the graduate" as a defense.

453
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,240
You can't use a movie made
before you were born as a defense.

454
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,410
Go out with me.

455
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,250
I like you, and you like me.

456
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:28,390
- Dell.
- Yeah.

457
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,950
Never gonna happen.

458
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,050
I'm starting to think L.A.
Is like new york, but with a beach.

459
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:50,060
Why do you think we moved here?

460
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,900
Uh, Pete.

461
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,590
Uh, isn't it time for you
to get some refills?

462
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,560
Thanks.
Thanks, buddy.

463
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,940
Okay, pete is my friend,
don't get me wrong, but--

464
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,370
why are you warning me about him?

465
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,930
What, is he like a serial killer?
Is he a felon?

466
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,500
Is he sesecretly my ex-husband's best friend?

467
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,720
His wife died eight years ago.

468
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,790
- Now I feel shallow.
- No, it's just...

469
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,860
He can't connect with women.

470
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:26,330
He's a good man, but if you want
someone who's gonna be there,

471
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:29,070
then Pete's not that guy.

472
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,850
- You ready?
- Yeah, good.

473
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,590
This is nice, huh?

474
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,610
- It is.
- Yeah.

475
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,620
No, no.
Oh, no.

476
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,120
- What?
- That's not nice.

477
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,840
- Oh, you s--
- hold it, hold it, hold on.

478
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,630
You said, "be a man."

479
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,890
Oh, cooper, I commend you.

480
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,120
You're making an effort.
But I'm--I'm--

481
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,570
but I'm your friend.

482
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:08,920
You can't be a man with your friend.

483
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,810
- Isn't that settling?
- Kinda, yeah.

484
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,670
- Yes.
- Okay.

485
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:17,890
- Settling.
- Great.

486
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,280
- Thank you, yes.
- But we're good?

487
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:23,180
- We're very good.
- Okay.

488
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:25,270
Hey, ex-best friend.

489
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,560
- Hey, ex-husband.
- You are drunk.

490
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:32,220
Ten more minutes, and I start dancing,
and I require company.

491
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,570
I don't think I've ever seen her drunk before.

492
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,280
Sam...

493
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,690
Did you cheat on her?

494
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:50,300
Over the years, there have been temptations,

495
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,590
but, no...

496
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,400
I didn't.

497
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,020
Was there a lot of fighting or...

498
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,760
Hardly ever.

499
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,700
Honestly...

500
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,540
It was bad, what I did.

501
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,140
I have no good reason.

502
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,330
I woke up one day...

503
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:17,450
And I couldn't do it anymore.

504
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,510
It wasn't even a choice.

505
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,310
I had a thought...

506
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,820
Next thing you know...

507
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,600
I'm burning it all down.

508
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:32,990
I left her.

509
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,600
I don't know why.

510
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:39,210
I don't know why.

511
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,420
- What kind of a person does that?
- Hell if I know.

512
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,030
And I did it, too.

513
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,740
So I ran into Allan...
At whole foods.

514
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:57,190
Wanna hear something funny?

515
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,700
He said he didn't believe in marriage,
that marriage wasn't for him.

516
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,590
But I guess that was wrong,
because it only took him four months.

517
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,600
Four months after we broke up,
he got married,

518
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,900
to someone who can't be
more than 25 years old.

519
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:15,210
Isn't that funny?

520
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,360
It heads off rejection.

521
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,080
What?

522
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,410
That's why I like the internet.

523
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:39,280
I can't stand the...

524
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,860
It's horrible, being rejected.

525
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,830
It is.

526
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,270
Preston, I thought you had a late surgery.

527
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,510
You know all that...

528
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,340
"I trust you" crap?

529
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,550
You've been pulling that on me
since I was this high.

530
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,780
- Preston, language.
- No.

531
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:18,910
"I trust you" is code for
"learn from your mistakes."

532
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,110
This is not a mistake.

533
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,780
- I never said it was a mistake.
- Cristina never knows

534
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,940
what's good for her.
That's who she is.

535
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,650
- Preston--
- she hates change.

536
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:31,000
I lead.
I have to.

537
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,180
And then she's grateful.

538
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,920
That's how it was with dating,
with moving in.

539
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,420
Then I'm pleased for you.

540
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,810
Look, I am going to make her happy, mama.

541
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,230
The wedding is a huge step,

542
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,190
and she's being a great sport.
You know why?

543
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:47,970
Because she will be happy someday.

544
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,270
If you are so sure...

545
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:55,460
Why are you yelling at me?

546
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:02,850
What happened?

547
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,860
She's septic.

548
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,940
The sooner we can get her to an O.R.,
The sooner we can help her.

549
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,690
- Let's move.Move.
- Richard, what--what happened?

550
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,970
Extremely rare complication.

551
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,990
Toxic mega colon with a perforation.

552
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,220
Can you get your dad out of this room, please?

553
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,720
This fast?
How could--

554
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,960
sometimes it progresses this rapidly.
Very rarely, but sometimes.

555
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,730
We booked an O.R.

556
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,850
You're going into surgery right now?
I-I didn't sign a consent form.

557
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:24,420
She needs surgery right now, Thatcher.
Not tomorrow, not later today.

558
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,580
- Right now.
- Thatcher.

559
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,260
- Honey, listen--
- we need you to stay back, okay?

560
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:38,420
You're gonna be okay.
This happens.

561
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,270
You're gonna be okay.

562
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,070
We're losing her pulse she's coding.

563
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:45,000
Okay, let's go.
Let's move.Move.

564
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,490
She's okay, huh?

565
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,670
I mean, after all she went through,
she still looks pretty awesome.

566
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:01,350
Lisa, we need to know
what you want to do with the baby.

567
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,610
Carol-- she wants this so bad.

568
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,580
This is about what you want.

569
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,950
We did find out the paternity.

570
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,970
No, no.
I don't wanna know.

571
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,740
She's awesome, though.

572
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,640
You don't have to decide right now.

573
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:21,670
No.
I know what I want to do.

574
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,560
Lisa gave the baby to carol.

575
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,930
On the condition they'd all be part of her life.

576
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,490
So it turns out the baby
will have three dads anyway.

577
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,490
- And two moms.
- Lisa did a good thing.

578
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,710
They look happy.

579
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:41,100
They look like a family.

580
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,620
- Izzie, look--
- look, I don't want you to go.

581
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:13,760
To mercy west-- I don't want you...

582
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:16,700
It's not fair.

583
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:22,310
I know we can't help what happened,
and I know that we didn't...

584
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,920
I stood in that bridal shop with your wife,

585
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:30,200
and I smiled and I talked, and I felt like...

586
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,860
It's not fair.

587
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:35,690
I don't want you to go to mercy west
because I'm losing my best friend,

588
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:39,200
and it's not fair.

589
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:42,500
It's just not fair.

590
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:20,270
We can't.

591
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:23,070
I know.

592
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,110
Hey.
I was looking for you.

593
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,360
You ready to go?

594
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,720
A lot of folks would kill
for what you have, you know?

595
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,940
A clean slate.

596
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:44,130
So you don't remember?
So what?

597
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,350
You'll make new memories.

598
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:49,000
Oh, wow.
Look at that.

599
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,180
It's so beautiful.

600
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,600
How can you be so...

601
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:01,630
You're so good with me.

602
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:07,090
What's wrong with you that you can't be
this good with someone you have feelings for?

603
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:11,480
What happened to you, Alex?

604
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:21,470
Maybe I don't remember.
So what?

605
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:01,930
W-we did everything...
We could.

606
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,450
You--you said it was really simple

607
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,380
and that it was this...

608
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,850
Small thing.

609
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:24,480
- It was.
- She had the hiccups.

610
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,800
She came here...

611
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,940
Because-- because she trusted you.

612
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:34,350
I trusted you.

613
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,380
- Meredith, just stop...Okay, just stop.
- No, don't.Don't.

614
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:45,710
At some point, maybe we accept that
the dream has become a nightmare.

615
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:49,270
She had the hiccups.

616
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,150
Oh, god.
The hiccups.

617
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:06,170
They've left.
It's just us.

618
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,690
Oh, thank god.
Ohh.

619
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:22,730
- I got a dress.
- Yeah?

620
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,160
You happy?

621
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:33,650
Yeah.
Are you...Happy?

622
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,720
Yeah.

623
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:43,640
We tell ourselves the reality is better.

624
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,930
Limes!

625
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,140
- Limes.
- Limes.

626
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,180
So what are we drinking to this time?

627
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,150
Friends.
Crappy friends.

628
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,860
Family.
Crappy family.

629
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,620
Again?

630
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:06,580
- Again.
- Again.

631
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,710
Who wants another?

632
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:26,740
We convince ourselves it's better
that we never dream at all.

633
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,060
But the strongest of us,
the most determined of us,

634
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,110
we hold on to the dream.

635
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,950
You're ugly and old.

636
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:36,980
I'll miss you, too.

637
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,290
Okay.

638
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:45,290
There is an empty office.

639
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,930
Don't tempt me.

640
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:49,190
Think about it.

641
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:56,150
Or we find ourselves faced with
a fresh dream we never considered.

642
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,710
Hold the door.

643
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,800
We awake to find ourselves...

644
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:05,410
Against all odds...

645
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,560
Feeling hopeful.

646
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,070
This is gonna sound...

647
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:16,830
When no one else is around,
the elevator kind of, uh...

648
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,110
Talks to me.

649
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,210
- Hi, Tilly.
- Hey, Pete.

650
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,390
That's Tilly.

651
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,490
She works security.
The camera is right there.

652
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:33,290
Oh.

653
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,690
Hello, Tilly.

654
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,760
Hey, I get my kicks wherever I can.

655
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,370
- You goin' home?
- Yeah...

656
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,110
Home.

657
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:48,560
You get what you came for?

658
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,790
I honestly...

659
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:53,100
Don't know.

660
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,380
Do you want me to kiss you again?

661
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,890
I think...

662
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,410
Not.

663
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:04,020
Because of the elevators where you come from?

664
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,890
Those horny, aphrodisiac elevators?

665
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:10,040
Yeah, that, and, um...

666
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,780
I'm not interested, so...

667
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,630
Oh.

668
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:28,280
You're interested.

669
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,290
And if we're lucky, we realize...

670
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:38,270
In the face of everything,
in the face of life...

671
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:44,810
The true dream...

672
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:48,990
Is being able to dream at all.
