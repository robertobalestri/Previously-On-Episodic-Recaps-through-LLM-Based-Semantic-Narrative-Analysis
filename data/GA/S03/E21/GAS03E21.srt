1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,640
previously on  "grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,930
I had sex last night with the wrong person.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,420
This is our secret,okay?

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,150
Go 60 days with no sex,no other women.

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,900
if I'm not having sex,neither are you.

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,600
Chief resident?

7
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,100
The one fifth year resident
that rules all residents.

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,030
I went to the board this morning
and told 'em I was retiring.

9
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,840
I came out here to be chief,
and meredith complicates that.

10
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,300
So I just have to pick one?

11
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,520
If you don't pick one,

12
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,560
this is gonna be your face the rest of your life.

13
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,410
My name is not ava!

14
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,440
You made it up!

15
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,800
It's not me!

16
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,970
What percentage of americans will get an acute appy?

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,490
as interns,we know what we want--
to become surgeons...

18
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,250
And we'll do anything  to get there.

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,990
what are the signs of residual eye infections?

20
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,850
uh,pus,uh,redness and,uh,fever.

21
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,470
Suffer through killer exams,endure 100-hour weeks,

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,070
stand for hours on end  in operating rooms...

23
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,730
You name it,we'll do it.

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,570
What's conn's syndrome?

25
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,330
Uh,w-wait,wait,I know this.

26
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,780
oh,tick tock,dude.

27
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,180
cracking under the pressure.

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,000
hypercortolis--cortisolism!

29
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,090
Uh,primary hyperaldosteronism.

30
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,190
Yes! Out of the seat. My turn.

31
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,900
No,it's my turn.

32
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:11,970
No,it is not.

33
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,620
Um,try this one.

34
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,260
- You know,I--
- white sponge with vanilla buttercream.

35
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah,you know,I'm trying to study for
the most important test of my intern career.

36
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,520
I-I don't have time for wedding cake.

37
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,770
Well,just try it.

38
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,020
Go! Go!

39
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,390
Uh,what is the strongest layer of the small bowel?

40
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,780
Fine. Yummy. Go.

41
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,290
oh,damn it,damn it,damn it.

42
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,550
It is not snot.

43
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,050
- Submucosa! 
- Yes.

44
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,360
Wait,wait,wait. How do you know that?

45
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,120
Are you studying with the wife's cards?

46
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,080
What cards?

47
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,540
Callie was ranked number one
in her year after this test.

48
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,290
She has legendary flash cards.

49
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,730
We don't need the flash cards.

50
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,520
We are independently brilliant.

51
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,440
Dream team.

52
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,570
yeah,I'm gonna hurl. Outta the seat.

53
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,270
- No,my turn. I'm gonna kick all your asses.
- Oh,come on.

54
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,670
This is the lemon.

55
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,180
Might be a little tart.

56
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,470
what is actinic keratosis?

57
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,630
Uh...actinic keratosis is,uh,
a premalignant lesion.

58
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,220
In old people.

59
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:54,970
In anyone.

60
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,140
Too tart?

61
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,600
I don't care.

62
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,470
I mean,is alex right or am I?

63
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,940
Learn to care,
or I'll get another bride.

64
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,870
I love it. I love all cakes.

65
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,180
Now break the tie.

66
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,510
- karev's right. 
- Yes! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

67
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,280
The tough part,though,
is reconciling  this huge thing we want--

68
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,170
to be surgeons--
with everything else we want.

69
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,850
Hey.

70
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:20,870
Oh,hey.

71
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,030
I haven't seen you in a few days.
I left messages.

72
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,210
Yeah,I know. I was just ying to--

73
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,990
I know I told you to stop hovering,
and you did,and I appreciate that.

74
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,160
But now stop with the stopping.

75
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,030
No,you're right.

76
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,120
It's ridiculous for me to
worry about you all the time.

77
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,180
It's sweet that you worry.

78
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,060
It is.

79
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,160
- I should communicate more.
- Right.

80
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,390
You don't think I can do it.

81
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,740
- I can do it. 
- Really?

82
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,510
In a few seconds,
I'll be getting on that elevator.

83
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,010
And then I'll be going on rounds.

84
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,390
See,uh,I'm,uh,getting on the elevator.

85
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,770
Communicating.

86
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,820
28 more days and...

87
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,470
Then it's you and me in a locked room

88
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,010
for a record-breaking,earth-shattering,
mind-blowing--

89
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,230
ok,I get it.

90
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,880
Thank you.

91
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,130
That was less than enthusiastic.

92
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,630
I'm gonna be more enthusiastic when we...

93
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,800
cross the finish line.

94
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,380
okay.

95
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,600
Just making sure you haven't lost
interest in the project.

96
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,720
Not at all.

97
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,690
Good.

98
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,150
What are you doing?

99
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,660
The bakery wantse to make a decision by tomorrow.

100
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,050
So if you can tell me your favorite by then,
that would be great.

101
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,330
Cakes and little place cards?

102
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,700
Okay,he's turning into a girl.

103
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,750
I think it's sweet.
He obviously cares about this stuff.

104
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,350
This white one taste's pretty good.

105
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,880
I should bring a piece to derek,right?

106
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,800
That's what good girlfriend's do,
bring their boyfriend's cake and communicate?

107
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,130
No. The best ones just keep all that stuff to themselves.

108
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,320
Did you bring callie's cards?

109
00:03:59,370 --> 00:03:59,980
Uh no.

110
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,200
Oh,well,no cake for you.

111
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,910
dr. Bailey,I saw a hemiglossectomy on the board.Can I scrub in?

112
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,140
- No,no,no. You're not doing surgeries today.
- What?

113
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,890
Your intern exams are in two weeks.

114
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,780
You need to spend every available minute studying for them.

115
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,530
Oh,believe me,when you won't have to repeat your year as interns,

116
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,290
you'll be thanking me for this opportunity.

117
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,870
So,grey and yang,you're...

118
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,620
doing scut.

119
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,930
O'malley,stevens,you'll be joining me in the clinic.

120
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,190
Karev,you're with ava.

121
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,340
Um,I don't always have to be on her case.

122
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,680
Someone else can have her.

123
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,460
Or not.

124
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,380
so...

125
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,010
last night we studied together.

126
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,880
Today we're,uh,treating patients together.

127
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,660
And we're fine.

128
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,440
We're not tortured,it's not weird.

129
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,370
We made a mistake and we've moved on.

130
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,760
If anything,I think it brings us closer together as friends.

131
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,260
We're very impressive.

132
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,330
I think we are.

133
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,930
Larry jennings just checked in to the hospital.

134
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:55,740
What's the matter with him?

135
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,780
I have no idea.

136
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,470
His assistant said it was a matter
of the utmost discretion.

137
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,540
Oh,that's never good.

138
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,790
Yeah,whatever it is,it was important enough for him to cut short his vacation and fly home.

139
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,130
I want you on point on this one.

140
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,290
No clinic today.

141
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,060
Oh,I can do both.

142
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,900
Miranda,we are talking the chairman of the board of seattle grace hospital.

143
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,970
The clinic will survive without you for a day.

144
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,200
Learn to delegate.

145
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,970
Well,who am i supposed to delegate to?

146
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,410
Chief webber,you paged me?

147
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,800
Sydney heron reporting for duty.

148
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,500
hey.

149
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,220
I was wondering if I was gonna see you today.

150
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,140
Where you been?

151
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,940
Just getting massignments.

152
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,430
Yeah,anything good?

153
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:41,290
Anything as good as a crazily hormonal pregnant amnesiac with a tendency to yell at the wrong people?

154
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,480
Your blood pressure's higher than it should be.

155
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,960
So what,we're not friends anymore?

156
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,100
Fine.

157
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,130
Then I won't tell you about dr. Montgomery's sex bet...

158
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,970
with the overly hot dr. Sloan.

159
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,640
Yeah.

160
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,320
If he can go 60 days without sex,
they're getting back together.

161
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,330
Apparently they used to be a thing back
when she was married to dr. Mcdreamy.

162
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,170
The question is,how do you know all that?

163
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,140
I'm on bed rest 5 feet from the nurses' station,and I have excellent hearing.

164
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,100
I know everything.

165
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,390
It's like--it's like watching a soap.

166
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,920
Do--do you know how many doctors
in this hospital nurse olivia has slept with?

167
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,480
Oh,wait. Who am I talking to? You're one of 'em.

168
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,400
Anyway,I'd strongly advise you to move on dr. Montgomery before you lose your shot,

169
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,790
or I would if we were friends.

170
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,550
So if she wants to be with sloan...

171
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,750
dude...

172
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,090
if she wanted to be with sloan,
she'd be with sloan.

173
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,330
The other board members have a say in who gets to be chief,

174
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,930
but larry--he's the one who really decides,okay?

175
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,440
He knows it,and they know it.

176
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,970
So if the attendingsfind out he's here--

177
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,830
the man won't get a moment's peace.

178
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,170
you have to leave now.

179
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,030
I want you all out of here,okay?

180
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,060
look,go,go,go. Out.

181
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,270
All right. But you know where to find me.

182
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,990
Chief webber? Celeste. Larry's assistant.

183
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,270
- He's in here.
- Okay.

184
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,610
Go away.

185
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,760
But we can help.

186
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,540
"We" can help?

187
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,040
What is that supposed to mean?

188
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,260
He doesn't haveany woman parts.

189
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,960
- Look,it's not like we don't know where he is.
- irrelevant.

190
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,240
right. We'd just come back anyway.

191
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,050
right.

192
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,560
Richard.

193
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,830
Finally.

194
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:58,920
Oh,for god sake.

195
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,650
What are the four musketeers doing here?

196
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,780
What happened to "I'll be discreet"?

197
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,430
Larry,they're here for the same reason I am,
to see if they can help.

198
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,340
Right.

199
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,290
Bunch of ghouls.

200
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,390
All right,one of you wants to be the new chief...

201
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,120
fix this...

202
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,180
and you got my vote.

203
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,270
And,no,those are not grapefruits.

204
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,780
Well...

205
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,060
looks as though you won't be needing my services after all.

and suprapubic tenderness.

210
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,350
That's because I haven't taken a leak in three days.

211
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,520
Three days.

212
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,070
could be a hernia.

213
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,800
A hernia wouldn't do that.

214
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,140
Was there trauma?

215
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,050
Testicular torsion,uh,you know,twisting?

216
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,710
Twisting?

217
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,920
You'd have to tie him in a triple knot
to get that kind of fluid buildup.

218
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,880
Am I wrong?

219
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,270
I was taking a 2-week raft ride down the amazon.

220
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,820
Oh. Maybe it's a tropical disease.

221
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,740
Schistosomiasis? Filariasis?

222
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,820
Well,now they're just guessing.

223
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,920
Richard!

224
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,600
Dr. Bailey,call dr. Fischer in urology to do a suprapubic cath

225
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,000
an order an ultrasound and K.U.B.

226
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,450
Larry,have you called nancy?

227
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,960
I don't want to worry my wife unless I have to.

228
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,630
She wasn't on the trip with you?

229
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,950
White chocolate with...

230
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,030
hmm,buttercream.

231
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,990
Dr. Montgomery.

232
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,910
I can't decide.

233
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,310
Triple berry at least has fruit,
so I could pretend it's healthy.

234
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,780
Yeah,ava's B.P. Is 171 over 118.

235
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,710
She's preeclamptic.

236
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,190
Yeah,I ordered blood tests
and a biophysical profile on the bY.

237
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,740
It was fine,but,uh,ava's got edema.

238
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,260
Get her on mag and hydralazine.

239
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,130
What about an epidural to
get her blood pressure down?

240
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,940
I mean,am I going overboard or--

241
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,380
believe me,I wish I had someone
who cared that much about my blood pressure.

242
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,320
Yeah,well,from what I hear,in 28 days you will.

243
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,060
I've had a cold,like forever.

244
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,690
And I've been here three times,

245
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,140
and they keep telling me it's gonna go away,

246
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,150
but my nose just won't stop running.

247
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,580
I'm like the most disgusting fountain in the world.

248
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,410
Sometimes these things just drag on.

249
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,330
You might have to wait it out.

250
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,990
No,I can't wait anymore.

251
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,270
See,there's,uh,there's a girl,

252
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,590
and we've been out a few times,

253
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,960
and now it's gotten to the point where we're supposed to,you know,seal the deal.

254
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,040
But the nose thing is so gross,I can't get anywhere near her.

255
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,140
Well,I'm sure if she's really into you,she'll hang in there.

256
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,800
No,no,no. You don't understand.

257
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,650
I mean,have you ever met someone
where the attraction was so intense,

258
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,020
you thought it may just kill you?

259
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,580
Like you're in the same room,and your skin is on fire.

260
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,850
You want to touch 'em so bad,it's like--

261
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,990
yeah,okay,we get it. We're...on the case.

262
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,450
Yes,I will do an E.N.T.,

263
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,410
And you will listen to his,uh...

264
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,140
- chest.
- Yes.

265
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:53,690
I'm on it.

266
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,670
Which fluid resuscitation technique is used in acute burns?

267
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,450
The parkland formula.

268
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,910
Come on,mer. Step it up.

269
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,100
What is virchow's triad?

270
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,830
Oh,I hate george.

271
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,390
He married into the cards.

272
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,310
You think he knew? You think that's why he married her?

273
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,480
Yeah,that's why he married her.

274
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,560
We need those cards.

275
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,590
We don't need the cards.

276
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,180
What is virchow's triad?

277
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,150
Dr. Torres.

278
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,050
Um,dr. Burke and I are trying to choose a wedding cake,and there are some samples in the conference room.

279
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,680
If you have a moment,I would really love your opinion,
because,I mean,you've got such great taste.

280
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,210
You're not getting my cards,yang.

281
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,610
Dr. Bailey.

282
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,140
need an intern?

283
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,150
Uh,yeah. How's it going in the clinic,o'malley?

284
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,790
How's sydney doing?

285
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,270
Oh,that's w-why you wanted to see me,
to find out how things were going?

286
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,010
I-I--she's--

287
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,260
dr. Bailey,um-- can I talk to you for a second?

288
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,890
Oh,of course,ms.Newman.

289
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,870
What can I do for you?

290
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,060
This is embarrassing.

291
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,020
Um,mortifying,actually.

292
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,410
I think I need to be tested.

293
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,030
Larry and I-- whatever larry has,
I probably have it as well.

294
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,710
- Uh,o'malley.
- Yeah.

295
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,080
Page dr. Montgomery.

296
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,140
Okay.

297
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,110
Okay.

298
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,790
How's it going,buddy bud?

299
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,960
I'm getting a strep culture on bed nine
and discharging mr.Benton.

300
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,200
The gentleman with the sinus issues?

301
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,220
It's a runny nose,and I have a test to study for,

302
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,190
and bailey doesn't like usto clog up the clinic--

303
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,720
ah,bailey's not here today,okay?

304
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,480
I am.

305
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,230
And it's all well and good to open a clinic as some kind of power play for chief resident,

306
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,610
but chief sident isn't reall about big think.

307
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,110
It's about patient care,okay?

308
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,280
So let's see what we can do to improve mr.Benton's experience.

309
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,400
It's just a cold.

310
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,480
Nasal lavage.

311
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,400
Because we care.

312
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,430
Nasal lavage?

313
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,490
Get yourself a bulb syringe,squeeze an isotonic solution
into one of mr.Benton's nostrils.

314
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,130
It'll squirt right out the other side.

315
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,510
Incredibly restorative.

316
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,470
Rinse and repeat.

317
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,830
Rinse and repeat.

318
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,320
It's not what you think.

319
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,880
I-I mean,it is.It's,uh...

320
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,450
it's just not an affair.

321
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,440
Though,I guess technically it is.

322
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,850
But we're in love.

323
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,740
The,uh,the kind of love you think you're never gonna find,and then you do and...

324
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,390
the fact that he's married seems a small price to pay for being happy,you know?

325
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,430
At least,most of the time.

326
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,560
But then five years go by,and he still hasn't left his wife.

327
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,460
And you must think I'm a terrible person.

328
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,150
- No,no.no.No judgment whatsoever.
- No,no.

329
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,390
I mean,I know I should leave him,
it's just...

330
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,830
do you have any idea how rare it is to find someone you can work and play with?

331
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,430
And we love each other.

332
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,710
How wrong can it be?

333
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,800
richard,this thing still hurts like hell,
and my boys here are not getting any smaller.

334
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,500
I want to know what you're doing about it.

335
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,240
Well,the urologist just drained your blder.

336
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,060
Next step is an ultrasound and an x-ray.

337
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,800
- The interns will be taking you up quickly.
- No,no,no,no.

338
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,950
I mean,what are you  doing for me?

339
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,900
Getting some of the best surgeons
in the world to help you.

340
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,030
I came here for you.

341
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,120
You.

342
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:53,950
You're the best surgeon in this place,
at least you used to be.

343
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,720
What's the problem,larry?

344
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,100
Am I not taking good enough care of you?

345
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,900
How does a man lose his desire at 53,54,
however old you are?

346
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,530
How does-- how does that happen?

347
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,000
I haven't,okay?

348
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,260
There are other things in life.

349
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,350
Like what,adele leaving you?

350
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,300
Even more reason to keep the job.

351
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,400
You're a surgeon,man.

352
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,270
I have to go skinny-dipping in the amazon
to get that kind of a thrill.

353
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,320
I'm not gonna let you browbeat me
into keeping this job.

354
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,350
Like I'd even want to at this point.

355
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,890
When I appointed you chief of surgery,
you were hungry,you were the man.

356
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,170
Now you're a politician,giving me excuses,
handing things off.

357
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,210
I hate to think that's the kind of doctor
that you've become,

358
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:33,470
but if it is,maybe it is best
that you're stepping down.

359
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,730
I know I saidyou could use the day to study,

360
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,840
but we've got an all-hands- on-deck situation.

361
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,920
A-a bad car accident?

362
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,140
Multiple gunshot wounds?

363
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,170
A penis.

364
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,080
The chairman of the board's penis.

365
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,040
What's wrong with it?

366
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,690
His testicles have swollen,
which is the understatement of the year.

367
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,170
Fantastic. How much?

368
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,070
No,you know,don't tell me.

369
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,270
Let it be a surprise.

370
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,470
Look,you and grey can take him
for his ultrasound and his x-ray.

371
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,510
The V.I.Penis.

372
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,740
Just go.

373
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,420
elephantiasis?

374
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,320
No way jennings has that.

375
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,510
Did you check for brucellosis?

376
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,670
It could be fournier's gangrene.

377
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,180
I don't know.

378
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,280
I'd go to gonorrhea before I went there.

379
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,810
Then again,I'll be there at the finish line to 
make him pretty,which is what he'll remember.

380
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,940
oh,uh,derek.

381
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:29,200
Grey wanted me to tell you that
she's still working on jennings' x-ray,

382
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,710
and that she'll be in the,uh,x-ray viewing room.

383
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,430
Od to know.

384
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,250
She's communicating.

385
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,000
Just when I need time to think,
she suddenly starts communicating.

386
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,510
Time to think about what?

387
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:43,380
All of it-- the relationship,the chief thing,

388
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,100
how to juggle both without getting distracted.

389
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,320
With cristina,I have to be explicit.

390
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,450
There would be no wedding if I wasn'T.

391
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,550
Oh,it's that easy,huh?

392
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,800
Oh,no.

393
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,960
I never said it was easy.

394
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,380
Right.

395
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,200
Hey.

396
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:07,910
Hey.

397
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,050
How's it going?

398
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,210
I,uh,caught george in a lie the other day.

399
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,570
He said he spent the day in the clinic
when he spent it doing god knows what with izzie stevens.

400
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,290
It's probably nothing,right?

401
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,210
Right.

402
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,780
Right.

403
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,940
So how's your man-whore?

404
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,520
miraculously reformed?

405
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,680
for now.

406
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,900
That's never gonna turn him into...

407
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,310
what I want.

408
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,280
Which is?

409
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,480
The whole thing.

410
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:42,320
I want someone stable who barbecues
and teaches little kids how to play catch.

411
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,280
That's not mark sloan.

412
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:51,520
Which doesn't explain why I spent the entire day looking at alex karev like a puppy at a chew toy.

413
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,140
Why don't you just go there already?

414
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,780
Because he doesn't barbecue either.

415
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,000
Plus,he's like 12 years old.

416
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,140
He could fit all of his belongings in a milk crate.

417
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,230
I don't know.

418
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,720
Guys like karev...

419
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,270
look,at least you know he'll never lie to you.

420
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,560
Guys like him,they...

421
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,270
they mess around in their 20s,but then they,you know,

422
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,810
pack it in and teach their kids to play catch.

423
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,660
Maybe.

424
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,340
I need to stop thinking about both of them.

425
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,790
And I have to stop thinking about izzie stevens.

426
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,270
Hey,callie...

427
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:27,230
here's the thing,when you're obsessing
about something like that,

428
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,840
there's generally a reason.

429
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,760
What the hell are you doing?

430
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,190
nasal lavage.

431
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,320
Why?

432
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,070
Because she's trying to kill me.

433
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,530
Sydney.

434
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,540
Dr. Bailey,we've really turned this place around today.

435
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,250
Nasal lavage?

436
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,530
Four visits in one month?

437
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,370
Oh,are you questioning my patient care?

438
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,130
Miranda,I get it,okay?

439
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,230
You're protecting your turf.

440
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,010
Very mama bear.

441
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
Very chief resident.

442
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,360
But this is not about hospital politics,okay?

443
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,690
This is about the patient.

444
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,070
The patient can go home.

445
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,160
Get that stuff out of his nose.

446
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,970
No,I'm not comfortable discharging him
until we've addressed his problem.

447
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,450
The 16 patients in the waiting room aren't comfortable either.

448
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,270
Sir,I...

449
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,720
I-I don't think there's anything else we can do.

450
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,040
You know,colds drag on.

451
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:21,200
Yeah. Yeah,I hear you.

452
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,280
Oh,hell.

453
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,390
What?

454
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,660
That come out of his nose?

455
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,500
See? This is why I'm never gonna have sex again.

456
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,050
Uh,wait right here.

457
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,660
Um,order a head C.T.

458
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,930
Why? It's not a cold?

459
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,390
No,dr. Stevens.

460
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,310
It's definitely not a cold.

461
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,670
Hey,just so you know,I'll be over here while you're over there,okay?

462
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,740
Cute.

463
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,250
Easy to locate,right?

464
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,300
Girlfriend comes with a G.P.S

465
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,850
Looks like some kind of foreign object.

466
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,080
Ouch.

467
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,080
that almost looks like...

468
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,370
a skeleton.

469
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,430
It's skeleton-like.

470
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,020
Definitely skeletony.

471
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,220
Are those barbs?

472
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,360
No.

473
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,940
Can't be.

474
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,580
Well,it could be.

475
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,660
It looks like a teeny,tiny catfish.

476
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,890
That's close.

477
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,990
You see there?

478
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,350
Those are spines.

479
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,500
This is a candiru fish.

480
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,380
The penis fish?

481
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,420
This guy has the penis fish...

482
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,240
in his...

483
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,720
in his...

484
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,150
wow.

485
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,670
What the hell did you do to me?

486
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,340
You know,most pregnant laboring women love their epidurals.

487
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,420
I'm not in labor.

488
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,430
I'm trying to keep it that way.

489
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,790
By paralyzing me from the waist down?

490
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,570
I can't even sit up in the bed.

491
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,040
I'm missing the show-- the seattle grace show.

492
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,160
I can help with that.

493
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,790
So I guess you're talking to me again.

494
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,280
Well,I can't stay mad at you.

495
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:52,860
I tried.

496
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,930
But I couldn't do it.

497
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,160
You make your move on the redhead?

498
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,090
I thought you already knew everything
that went on in this hospital.

499
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,870
As a matter of fact,I have an update.

500
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,280
I saw her talking to the ortho resident.

501
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,460
Yeah,and?

502
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,780
she's seizing. She's seizing!

503
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,970
Somebody page dr. Montgomery!

504
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,980
Somebody page dr. Montgomery now!

505
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,460
It's the candiru.

506
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,460
It's a freshwater fish that lives in the amazon.

507
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,390
It's a parasite.

508
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,520
I'm not an idiot.I dind't drink from the amazon

509
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,450
Did you urinate in it?

510
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,660
No,I--what?

511
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,990
The candiru is attracted to blood and urine.

512
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,820
It's been known to swim up the stream of
urine and lodge itself in a man's urethra.

513
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,610
- You mean a fish swam up--
- it's rare,but there are documented cases.

514
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,000
One man actually saw it go in and tried to grab it.

515
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:37,830
It was too slippery.

516
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:38,790
Yang.

517
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,560
It's in the literature.

518
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,210
- So this thing is in my-
- is now in your bladder.

519
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,720
Well,right next to it.

520
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,240
It's stuck in your,uh,prostatic urethra,
which is causing the obstruction.

521
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,880
We need to get it quickly before it causes sepsis.

522
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,050
Sepsis?

523
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,020
You mean I could die?

524
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,010
B.P.Shot up to 202 over 134.

525
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,770
There's fetal distress.
The epidural didn't help.

526
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,090
It'll help during delivery.

527
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,560
What's going on? Alex?

528
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,640
Your blood pressure spiked. You had a seizure.

529
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:12,120
The only way we can reduce your blood pressure and the swelling in your brain is if we deliver the baby right now.

530
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,030
No. She's only 30 weeks.

531
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,950
I'm not in labor.

532
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,540
We're gonna do a c-section,ava. Don't worry.

533
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,510
The survival rate for
preemies at 30 weeks is extremely high.

534
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,860
Alex,tell her no.

535
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:21,940
I'm not ready.

536
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,770
You're ready.

537
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,670
But I can't do this by myself.

538
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,620
Well,then it's a good thing you're not by yourself.

539
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,400
I was on a consult on the chairman of the board.

540
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,480
This better be good. What do we have?

541
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,780
Well,we had a patient in the clinic--

542
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,080
chronic runny nose,a halo sign on the pillow.

543
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,890
The fluids are still in the lab,
but as far as I can tell--

544
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,740
he's leaking spinal fluid through his nose.

545
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,330
Thought you might like this one.

546
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,140
Oh,okay. Look at that.

547
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,630
It's a brain herniation.

548
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,360
His brain is literally sinking into his skull base.

549
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,660
And all along,I thought it was a cold.

550
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,470
book an O.R.

551
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,380
Dr. Bailey?

552
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,960
Oh,no,no. You're still studying.

553
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,950
You can watch from the gallery.

554
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,080
I'll scrub in with you.

555
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,350
I thought you were doing jennings.

556
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,780
No,um,I'll do both.

557
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,500
I sent this guy home three times.

558
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,380
I can't not scrub in.

559
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,600
oh,your daughter is beautiful,ava.

560
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,230
she is?

561
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,200
she is.

562
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,870
- Get her over to the warmer right away.
- I'll work on her.

563
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,280
Hand her off to peds.
I need an extra set of hands.

564
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,600
We need to hang some blood.

565
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,320
why?

566
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,780
Why do we need blood?

567
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,650
- want me to get the uterine arteries?
- Yeah.

568
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,370
Clamp.

569
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,360
Uh,alex,what's going on?

570
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,290
Alex?

571
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,590
If the bleeding vessels are deep--

572
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,730
tell me what's going on.

573
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,380
- Ligate around the hemostats. Got it.
- Am I gonna die?

574
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,670
Oh,my god.

575
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,020
I'm gonna die.

576
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,540
Oh,my god.

577
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:37,430
I'm gonna die.

578
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,350
- Can I?
- Go ahead.

579
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,110
I'm gonna die and my baby's gonna be all alone.

580
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,750
Oh,my god. oh,my god.

581
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,520
Ava.

582
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,010
Ava,look at me.

583
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,290
Look at me.

584
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,990
You're not gonna die.

585
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,810
You're doing great.

586
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,230
You're gonna be fine.

587
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,120
Your baby's gonna be fine.

588
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,130
I just need you to breathe for me,all right?

589
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,470
Nice slow,deep breaths.

590
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,480
that's it.

591
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,400
Just breathe. That's it.

592
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,990
Keep breathing. There you go.

593
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,830
Celeste.

594
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:07,470
Good news.

595
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,020
No chances of an S.T.D.

596
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:13,390
Larry's condition-- he's having surgery,
but you are fine.

597
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,690
You did hear the part about you being fine,right?

598
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,600
That's what I keep telling myself,that I'm fine with things they way they are,but...

599
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,800
I probably won't be really fine until
I don't care if he's fine anymore.

600
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,030
celeste?

601
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,550
I got here as soon as...

602
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,200
is he in surgery yet?

603
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,830
Um,no. They're taking him soon.

604
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:37,160
- This is dr. O'malley. Dr. O'malley...This is mr.Jennings' wife nancy.
- Hi

605
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,050
- Hi.
- It's a pleasure.

606
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,820
He's just in there.
They're prepping him for surgery.

607
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:41,550
Thank you.

608
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,800
I left my car in front in a no parking zone.

609
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,920
Could you move it?

610
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,080
what are you going to do?

611
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,240
Move her car.

612
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,550
- Talk about divine retribution.
- What?

613
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:03,900
He sleeps with his assistant and a carnivorous fish lodges itself in his penis.

614
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,790
That's instant karma if I've ever seen it.

615
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,210
Yeah,well,derek wasn't struck by lightning,
and neither were you.

616
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,440
Addison showed up.

617
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,300
I had months of pain and self-loathing,a crazy,

618
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,530
ranting mother and a near drowning off the side of a dock.

619
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,760
I mean,it's no fish in my hoo-hoo,
but it's certainly not an easy ride.

620
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,860
Yeah,well,I've cheated on my boyfriends,
and I'm fine.

621
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,270
I mean,am I the only one?

622
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,670
Which cake is your favorite,
or have you chosen one yet?

623
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,280
Okay,clearly,you're not getting the point.

624
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,350
I don't have favorite cakes.

625
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,910
That's why you're involved.

626
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,920
We gotta go.

627
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,570
If you see my boyfriend,
tell him I had some tuna salad and a yogurt,

628
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,130
and now I'm off to the O.R.

629
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,290
Okay,this is,uh,this is not eating for pleasure.

630
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,340
I really need a choice,
so mark down your favorite.

631
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,780
Sorry I froze there for a little bit.

632
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,480
That's okay.

633
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,660
I--I'm not--I'm not--
I'm not getting weird.

634
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,330
- You know,it was just a weird...
- shut up and eat some cake.

635
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,150
- Good?
- question.

636
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,120
Disgusting.

637
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,980
karev.

638
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,600
Hey.

639
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,780
I was just checking up on ava.

640
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,390
Do I have another denny duquette situation on my hands?

641
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,480
What? Are you serious?

642
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,890
I have never seen you so attentive with a patient.

643
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,280
You're always there-- checking her stats,
running tests,doing research.

644
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,870
- That's my job.
- No,it's my job.

645
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,020
I'm her doctor. You're my intern.

646
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,280
Which is why I have to know her stats at all times.

647
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,920
Because I'm not about to stand next to you in your O.R.

648
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,630
And be anything less than overprepared. Okay?

649
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:31,070
There's no way I'm gonna go to work every day
with a surgeon like you and not be at the top of my game.

650
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,950
So if you want to yell at me¡ª

651
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,700
I know you have to give him the cards
'cause you're married to him.

652
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,210
I respect that.

653
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,480
But there is an argument to be made for
female surgeons sticking together.

654
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,330
you're relentless.

655
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,470
"Sisterhood" and all that,you know?

656
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,670
Scary,inhuman relentless.

657
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:59,170
You are like a role model to me or...something.

658
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,840
Okay,you know what? Stop. okay?

659
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,350
This is just getting sad.

660
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,600
I will give the cards to george.

661
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,970
I am sure he will share.

662
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,350
No,he won't,with me anyway.

663
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,920
He'll just share the with izzie.

664
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:11,430
They're like an exclusive little unit. Whatever.

665
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,390
Yang.

666
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,030
Uh...my,uh...

667
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:21,010
my locker is on the right side,
third one from the door.

668
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,530
The cards are on the top shelf.

669
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,220
Really? You...

670
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,290
they're all yours.

671
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:37,600
Oh,god.

672
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,500
- Um...sorry.
- It's okay.

673
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,380
- I was,uh-- so I'm gonna-- so we're good?
- yeah,I--

674
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,680
- Yes,good.
- Good.

675
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,650
Okay,then.

676
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,260
don't talk.

677
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,600
Um,I know it's not fair,
and I know it's not your fault,

678
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,540
and I know there's nothing going on
between you and george.

679
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,470
I know that.

680
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,230
Except there is.

681
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,700
You're his best friend.

682
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,360
He loves you.

683
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,920
He gets you. He needs you.

684
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:18,170
And I'm just-- I'm just--I'm his wife.

685
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,410
And I know,I know I get the sex
and the commitment and the life with him...

686
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:27,050
but I-I want him to get me and to need me.

687
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,180
And I can't compete with you.

688
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,060
So I'm asking you...

689
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,110
to please stop.

690
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,940
Just stop.

691
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,960
Find another friend.

692
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,030
Or whatever you do,just give me my husband back.

693
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,820
what about the forked stone grasper?

694
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,700
It can lead to urethral injury.

695
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,050
well,the forceps aren't working.

696
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,010
At this point,I'm willing to try anything.

697
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:00,660
All right.

698
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,920
Stone grasper.

699
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,830
did we miss anything good?

700
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,740
Hello?

701
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:14,830
You okay?

702
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,560
I've had better days.

703
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,530
Where's dr. Bailey?

704
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,190
Page her.

705
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,800
v-tach.

706
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,550
Does he have a pulse with that?

707
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,040
Oh,he's going down.

708
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,880
Yes.

709
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,720
He needs 150 of amiodarone.

710
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:31,860
How much longer you think it'll take?

711
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,830
You worry about getting his arrhythmias down.

712
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,560
We're gonna have to change our game plan here.

713
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,720
The scope isn't working.

714
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,800
Excuse me,dr. Fischer.

715
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,230
We're gonna have to open him up.

716
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,010
I don't know how I missed it.

717
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,180
It presented as a cold,miranda.

718
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:48,120
This sort of thing,at some point,
you think it's gonna get better.

719
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,930
You really don't figure it's something 
that could ruin your whole life.

720
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,820
e chief.

721
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,000
The candiru?

722
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,410
Go ahead. We're almost done re.

723
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,260
Okay.

724
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,430
Hey. You want to quiz me on the G.I.Stuff?

725
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,530
No,I'm still trying to
get through my cardio notes.

726
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,780
You okay?

727
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:10,870
I'm fine.

728
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,120
I should have snuck in to the candiru surgery
with meredith and cristina.

729
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:14,760
You still can--

730
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:19,030
george,can you maybe stop talking
so I could concentrate?

731
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,150
what's your problem?

732
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,490
my problem...

733
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,160
is you.

734
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,130
You're my penis fish.

735
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:31,870
Your what?

736
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,320
You've crawled in,and latched on,

737
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:38,240
and now I can't move or talk or think or even pee

738
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,010
without the nagging feeling
that something is eating through my organs.

739
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,170
you don't even have a penis.

740
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:42,950
How am I the fish?

741
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,750
It's a metaphor,george.

742
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,310
What happened to us being fine?

743
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:52,950
I don't know.

744
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,420
maybe we're not.

745
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,980
a little more suction there,please.

746
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,060
Those barbs won't let go.

747
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,100
Dr. Bailey,glad you could join us.

748
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,410
Oh,this is useless.

749
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,260
We're gonna have to cut it out,dr. Fischer.

750
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,550
I'll repair the bladder.

751
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:23,800
Okay,let's do it.

752
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,420
How's his heart holding up?

753
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,970
Occasional runs of v-tach.

754
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,830
He can't take much more.

755
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,060
Forceps.

756
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,200
Okay.

757
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,000
Almost there.

758
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,460
Come on,you.

759
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,070
Almost there.

760
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,760
Got it.

761
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,490
oh,man.Unbelievable.

762
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,140
- You see that thing?
- *****

763
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,740
remind me never to pee  the amazon.

764
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,080
What?

765
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:18,840
What do you say we have a real meeting of the dirty mistresses club?

766
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,150
Like what it should've been from the beginning.

767
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,710
- What are you doing?
- Once.

768
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,650
20 minutes in the on call room.
Nobody ever finds out.

769
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,670
- Mark.
- What,

770
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,580
you're telling me everything's great between you and derek?

771
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,420
What makes you think there is something wrong between me and derek?

772
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,660
Something's always wrong between you and derek.

773
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:39,020
Enough.What is wrong with you?

774
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:44,420
nothing.I'm--I'M...addison
and I were gonna try and make a go of it.

775
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,940
Things are not gonna work out.

776
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,880
So you make a pass at me?

777
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,490
Like that'll help.

778
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,090
She doesn't want me.

779
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,120
Something's gotta help.

780
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:56,270
Revenge sex is not the answer.

781
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:59,680
If you're letting her go,let her go.

782
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,090
be an adult.

783
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:12,050
Thanks...for the baby and for me not dyi and stuff.

784
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,800
well,it's always a nice bonus when a patient doesn't die.

785
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:18,450
You and red make a pretty good team.

786
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,560
Don't tell sloan.

787
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,880
Oh,she and sloan aren't happening.She wants you.

788
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,140
- How do you know that?
- I know everything,remember?

789
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:30,810
I heard her talking to the ortho doc about
how she wants someone who barbecues and plays catch.

790
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,910
She wants someone who's committed.

791
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,590
Yeah.Well,that's not me.

792
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:38,270
I hate to tell you this,but it is.

793
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,680
You may talk tough,but you're a decent guy,alex.

794
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:45,620
Whether you want to admit it or not,
you're actually one of the good ones.

795
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,570
Mrs. Jennings.

796
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,090
Your husband's out of surgery.
Everything went very well.

797
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,440
Oh,thank you.

798
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,630
That's--that's wonderful.

799
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:01,640
Dr. Webber will be down to fill you in soon.

800
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,160
Uh,dr. O'malley,um,do me a favor.

801
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,330
Could you go tell ceste?

802
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:12,800
She's a basket case,and I just don't have it in me to take care omy husband's girlfriend right now.

803
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,160
Of course I know.

804
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,220
the wife always knows.

805
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,650
- dr. O'malley.
- Yes.

806
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:42,290
Mr. Jennings',uh,personal physician would like a copy of his medic records.

807
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,850
- Um,here's the number.
- Okay.

808
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,780
Mr. Jennings,I've canceled your appointments for next week.

809
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:51,660
There's just a conference call that's proving a little bit difficult to reschedule.

810
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,760
But I'm sure danny can handle it.

811
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,840
Wait,what's--what's danny got to do with it?

812
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:01,240
I've asked him to step in temporarily,
until you find someone else.

813
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,080
Now,w-wait,celeste...

814
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,010
what the hell was that all about?

815
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,100
Well,I think she just left you.

816
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,470
Good-bye,larry.

817
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,710
what--what the hell's going on here?

818
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:30,370
I think I'm done here.

819
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,960
Can you be a vault?

820
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:57,140
I think I need a vault 'cause I've eaten like a cake and a half,

821
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,340
and it's just not cutting it.And you don't gossip.

822
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,820
Because nobody tells me anything.

823
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,790
I was with a married man.It was--

824
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:08,560
unh-unh-unh.I don't mind that nobody tells me anything.

825
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,100
It was george.I was with george.

826
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:29,180
It should be firm inside,not spongy.

827
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:37,250
The frosting,like meringue-- light and not too sweet.

828
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:43,730
I always thought chocolate inside,
but,um,well,I'm leaning away from that.

829
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:48,050
You've thought a lot about this cake.

830
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,340
This cake...

831
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,650
for this day...

832
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,860
with tihs woman.

833
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:03,410
The red velvet's your winner,by the way.

834
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,080
What are you doing here?

835
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,090
I wanted you to know where I was,
so I thought I'd come and tell you.

836
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,220
Oh,you're mocking me.

837
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:21,490
I'm apologizing to you.

838
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,240
You're making light of things.

839
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,830
I'm running my fingers through your hair.

840
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,440
I'm standing in your bedroom,

841
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,590
unbuttoning my shirt.

842
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,270
And now I'm taking off my pants.

843
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:59,380
and now...I'm getting in your bed naked.

844
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,010
Mark...

845
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,710
we need to,um...

846
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:13,470
we should go get a drink,um,and maybe talk.

847
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:15,580
Do you have some time?

848
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:20,970
I mean,uh,just something's always wrong with you and me...

849
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:28,380
you don't want to have a drink with me.

850
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,170
I'm not what you're looking for.

851
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,750
What...are you talking about?

852
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,760
I slept with someone.Couldn't hold out.

853
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:42,770
Once a man-whore,always a man-whore,right?

854
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,690
- Miranda,go home.
- I'm almost done.

855
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,080
Go home.See your family.

856
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,860
You have to accept there are days where you can't do it all.

857
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,910
- You have to delegate.
- I did.

858
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,860
And then you do all the work anyway.
And you're still doing it.

859
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,410
You didn't have better things to do today than to ride herd on that V.I.P.Case?

860
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,930
There was a fish in a man's penis.

861
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,790
There's always gonna be a fish in a man's penis,chief.

862
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:14,650
You can say you movin' on all you wa,but are you really?

863
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:21,350
If you don't slow wn,you might end up without a family to go home to.

864
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,320
good night,miranda.

865
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,910
- now see,you can't do that.
- Do what?

866
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:34,690
Not look happy after sex.It's bad for the ego.

867
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,330
I'm fine.

868
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,140
- Are we fine?
- Sure.

869
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,870
Not so convincing.

870
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,810
I shouldn't have accused you of hovering.It wasn't nice.

871
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,000
You were just trying to be there for me.

872
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,990
But...now I'M...being available,

873
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:00,850
communicating and getting naked and doing all of your favorite things.

874
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,990
Good things.

875
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:05,180
Then why are you still staring at the ceiling?

876
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,390
I-I don't know.I just--I...

877
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:15,440
that day...you came out of the water...

878
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:20,990
I spent the scariest hour of my life trying to breathe for you.

879
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:26,900
I love you and I want you,but I don't know what to...

880
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,400
you didn't swim.

881
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,050
You didn't swim,and you know how to.

882
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:40,450
And I don't know if I can...

883
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,860
um,I don't know if I wanna...

884
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,920
keep trying to breathe for you.

885
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,810
I should go.

886
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,600
I'll go.

887
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:15,390
too often,the thing  you want most  is the one thing  you can't have.

888
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:19,410
what acid-based finding do you classically get with significant vomiting?

889
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,650
Hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis.Unbelievable.

890
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,140
Did you pick a cake?

891
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,460
Uh...I like the red one.

892
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:39,060

893
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,220

894
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,790
runny nose guy's big love.

895
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,820
I don't know how we do this.

896
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:19,930
I don't know how we work together and be friends and act like it's all okay.

897
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:27,500
I,um...there's a spot available at mercy west.

898
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:30,170
I called them.

899
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:33,730
You're gonna transfer to mercy west?

900
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,360
I have to.

901
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,980
Desire leaves us heartbroken...it wears us out.

902
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:47,490
Desire can wreck your life.

903
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,680

906
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,550
Okay.

907
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,060
You know,um...

908
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:07,570
I,uh,took that test once upon a time.

909
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,370
We could,um,go back to my hotel.

910
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,910
I could quiz you.

911
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,350
Look,uh,this...this isn't,uh...

00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:24,040

00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:28,110
I mean,no offense.Toy was awesome.
It's just...I'm--I'm really busy.

914
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:31,480
I have a lot of work to do.I don't have time for...

915
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:34,350
no,of course.

916
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,990
Uh...study.

917
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,250
That's what you're here for,right?

918
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,920
But as tough as wanting something can be...

919
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,210
the people who suffer the most...

920
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:05,900
are those who don't know what they want.
