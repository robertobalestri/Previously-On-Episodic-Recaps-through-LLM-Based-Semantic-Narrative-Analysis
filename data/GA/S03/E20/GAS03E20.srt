1
00:00:00,129 --> 00:00:01,485
<i>Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...<i>

2
00:00:01,506 --> 00:00:03,739
I had sex last night
with the wrong person.

3
00:00:03,808 --> 00:00:04,731
But the thing is,

4
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:06,102
it didn't feel wrong.

5
00:00:06,137 --> 00:00:07,194
This is our secret,

6
00:00:07,256 --> 00:00:07,626
okay

7
00:00:07,645 --> 00:00:08,814
We heard about your mother.

8
00:00:08,829 --> 00:00:10,338
We're here to make sure
that you're all right.

9
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,850
What if my husband shows up
tomorrow with a picture

10
00:00:12,868 --> 00:00:15,010
of what I'm supposed to
look like, but it's too late,

11
00:00:15,022 --> 00:00:17,048
and I'm stuck with the wrong
face for the rest of my life ?

12
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:19,854
Cristina and I were together
for three years.

13
00:00:19,876 --> 00:00:20,723
Are you gonna invite me ?

14
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:21,290
Where ?

15
00:00:21,335 --> 00:00:21,850
To the wedding.

16
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:22,773
Please leave.

17
00:00:24,656 --> 00:00:28,800
<i>A patient's history
is as important as their symptoms.<i>

18
00:00:28,835 --> 00:00:32,351
<i>It's what helps us decide
if heartburn's a heart attack,<i>

19
00:00:33,216 --> 00:00:35,092
<i>if a headache's a tumor.<i>

20
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:40,742
<i>Sometimes patients will try
to rewrite their own histories.<i>

21
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:44,843
<i>They'll claim they don't smoke
or forget to mention certain drugs,<i>

22
00:00:45,227 --> 00:00:47,231
<i>which, in surgery,<i>

23
00:00:47,516 --> 00:00:48,820
<i>can be the kiss of death.<i>

24
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:55,833
<i>We can ignore it all we want...<i>

25
00:00:57,448 --> 00:00:58,832
<i>but our history...<i>

26
00:01:00,036 --> 00:01:02,572
<i>eventually always comes back
to haunt us.<i>

27
00:01:07,307 --> 00:01:09,142
Meredith... she'll accept
a certain amount of help,

28
00:01:09,158 --> 00:01:10,842
and then she start
to feel suffocated.

29
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:12,293
Oh.

30
00:01:12,815 --> 00:01:14,880
Is this... am I suffocating ?

31
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:16,841
No. The groceries are just right.

32
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:19,233
It's... it's me. I sometimes overdo it.

33
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,950
Well, who could blame you
with everything ?

34
00:01:20,995 --> 00:01:23,703
After Ellis died, I gave her some time,

35
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:24,640
but I want to be here.

36
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:26,740
- I want to help make things easier.
- Good. Yeah.

37
00:01:26,785 --> 00:01:29,143
That's great ! Just try to keep it light.
You know, be helpful...

38
00:01:30,315 --> 00:01:31,981
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

39
00:01:32,045 --> 00:01:33,560
- Want some coffee ?
- Yes

40
00:01:35,298 --> 00:01:35,952
This all you ?

41
00:01:35,986 --> 00:01:38,192
I just picked up some things
to restock your fridge.

42
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,841
Well, you bought groceries last week.

43
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:42,263
Yeah, you have to get it
every week if you want more.

44
00:01:44,575 --> 00:01:45,480
Well, thank you.

45
00:01:45,536 --> 00:01:46,870
It's unexpected,

46
00:01:46,945 --> 00:01:48,421
and you didn't need to do all this.

47
00:01:49,915 --> 00:01:50,753
Is this for everybody ?

48
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,520
Absolutely.

49
00:01:51,556 --> 00:01:54,332
I gotta run. I'm gonna go talk to Richard
before things get too busy in the hospital.

50
00:01:54,586 --> 00:01:55,210
- See ya.
- Mm.

51
00:01:55,278 --> 00:01:56,850
Are you gonna talk
to him about the, uh...

52
00:01:56,895 --> 00:01:58,790
- Yeah. Wish me luck.
- You don't need it.

53
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:00,220
Just make him listen to you.

54
00:02:00,457 --> 00:02:01,653
You deserve to be chief.

55
00:02:09,507 --> 00:02:10,123
Nice sweater.

56
00:02:13,636 --> 00:02:14,192
Uh... my wife.

57
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:15,632
What ?

58
00:02:15,796 --> 00:02:16,262
My wife,

59
00:02:16,476 --> 00:02:17,220
she gave it to me.

60
00:02:17,898 --> 00:02:18,652
The sweater.

61
00:02:19,797 --> 00:02:21,973
Actually, it's my ex-wife.

62
00:02:23,406 --> 00:02:24,281
It's amicable.

63
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:25,413
I'm sorry ?

64
00:02:25,575 --> 00:02:27,350
The divorce, It's... It's amicable,

65
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:28,532
very friendly.

66
00:02:29,978 --> 00:02:31,131
I'm a friendly guy.

67
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,742
"I'm a friendly guy" ?

68
00:02:40,837 --> 00:02:41,740
Sloan.

69
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,942
She pressed five and got off at three.

70
00:02:44,005 --> 00:02:46,603
She'd rather walk up two flights
of stairs than flirt with you

71
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:48,892
Hell, she'd rather climb up
the outside of the building.

72
00:02:48,937 --> 00:02:51,160
- I wasn't flirting.
- You're telling me.

73
00:02:54,978 --> 00:02:57,180
There's no need to be embarrassed.

74
00:02:57,215 --> 00:02:59,512
Time for you to shake off the rust
and get back in the game.

75
00:03:00,675 --> 00:03:01,701
You need a wingman.

76
00:03:01,718 --> 00:03:03,373
I have patients to see.

77
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,380
We'd make a great team.

78
00:03:07,397 --> 00:03:09,471
Nothing like a quick
ventricular reconstruction

79
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:10,770
to jumpstart your morning, eh ?

80
00:03:11,086 --> 00:03:13,991
Okay, you're officially becoming
creepy, creepy and...

81
00:03:14,148 --> 00:03:15,051
stalking.

82
00:03:15,088 --> 00:03:17,331
Burke and I have set our date.
We're getting married ne month.

83
00:03:17,395 --> 00:03:18,863
We both know you're not

84
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,020
the marrying kind.

85
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:20,973
Well, you don't know that.

86
00:03:21,048 --> 00:03:21,931
You don't know me anymore.

87
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:23,423
Well, just to be sure you're

88
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,341
fully aware of what you're passing up,

89
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:29,001
I'd like you to assist me on my
heterotopic heart transplant today.

90
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,550
What, a piggyback transplant ?
Seriously ?

91
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:35,133
Burke will want to scrub in,
too, I imagine,

92
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:37,081
See how it's done.

93
00:03:38,738 --> 00:03:41,992
Heterotopic transplant.
He is upping his game.

94
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:43,590
I need a gambit.

95
00:03:43,668 --> 00:03:45,650
I need to force him into the defensive.

96
00:03:45,815 --> 00:03:47,070
Take his queen.

97
00:03:48,056 --> 00:03:49,381
You've never played chess ?

98
00:03:49,407 --> 00:03:50,260
I'm not a geek.

99
00:03:50,387 --> 00:03:51,233
I've gotta crush him.

100
00:03:51,695 --> 00:03:53,000
I've gotta annihilate him
at his own game.

101
00:03:53,007 --> 00:03:55,910
So it's weird, right, that Susan
keeps stopping by like this ?

102
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:59,132
I mean, we just became friends
or semi-related or whatever you call

103
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:00,410
your estranged father's wife.

104
00:04:00,437 --> 00:04:02,663
You may be confused since you
were basically raised by wolves,

105
00:04:02,686 --> 00:04:03,982
but this is what mother's do.

106
00:04:04,097 --> 00:04:06,180
They stop by, they stock the fridge.

107
00:04:06,238 --> 00:04:07,781
Hey, dude, you think she might do
our laundry ?

108
00:04:07,796 --> 00:04:08,201
Hey,

109
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:09,583
get your own fake mom.

110
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:11,242
Hey.

111
00:04:12,347 --> 00:04:13,340
Bad night on call ?

112
00:04:13,396 --> 00:04:14,301
Oh, god.

113
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:18,232
Yeah, when my patient's gooey abscess
exploded all over me at 4 :00 A.M.,

114
00:04:18,245 --> 00:04:19,061
That was a highlight.

115
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:20,731
Holy mary, mother of god,

116
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:23,911
pray for us sinners now and at the...

117
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:25,050
Iz, you look nice.

118
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:28,053
Did you just come from
confession in a church ?

119
00:04:28,076 --> 00:04:28,731
Shut up.

120
00:04:30,096 --> 00:04:31,730
Izzie Stevens does penance.

121
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:33,370
You did something bad.

122
00:04:34,446 --> 00:04:36,622
Oh. I feel like poo.

123
00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:38,683
I just hope I can make it through
the day without falling asleep.

124
00:04:38,687 --> 00:04:40,212
Do you want to make a coffee date ?

125
00:04:40,538 --> 00:04:42,762
3 :00 P.M. You could use
a little pick-me-up.

126
00:04:43,487 --> 00:04:44,011
Yeah.

127
00:04:44,226 --> 00:04:45,902
- That sounds nice, really nice.
- Good.

128
00:04:46,326 --> 00:04:46,772
Okay.

129
00:04:53,257 --> 00:04:54,040
Smile.

130
00:04:55,488 --> 00:04:57,122
Oh, come on, man. That's not a smile.

131
00:04:57,205 --> 00:04:57,861
Can I see ?

132
00:05:00,235 --> 00:05:00,893
That's me ?

133
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:02,852
Oh, my God.

134
00:05:04,498 --> 00:05:07,282
I know this is gonna sound terrible,
but I'm not bad-looking.

135
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:09,452
I think beautiful is the word
you're looking for.

136
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:11,232
I was gonna say hot.

137
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:13,050
I was, too, but I think
I would've gotten in trouble.

138
00:05:13,057 --> 00:05:13,472
You would've.

139
00:05:13,486 --> 00:05:15,022
Still a little swelling.

140
00:05:15,057 --> 00:05:17,190
In a day or two, I'll raise
that hot to smokin'.

141
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:19,340
Then shouldn't we wait
to take the "after" pictures ?

142
00:05:19,348 --> 00:05:22,240
We could, but the sooner we take them,
the sooner we get them out there.

143
00:05:22,257 --> 00:05:23,520
Your picture's gonna be everywhere...

144
00:05:23,552 --> 00:05:24,878
the police, the news, the internet.

145
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:26,864
But if my face
looks completely different,

146
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:28,613
then what good would pictures do ?

147
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:30,852
I was able to maintain
aspects of your bone structure,

148
00:05:30,855 --> 00:05:33,950
so your face bears some similarities
to your old face, plus, your...

149
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:35,770
your hair and your eyes are the same.

150
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:36,541
You think...

151
00:05:36,595 --> 00:05:39,091
do you really think someone might
recognize me ?

152
00:05:39,115 --> 00:05:40,050
I think you should smile.

153
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:43,922
I'm telling you,

154
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,403
this confession thing, it...

155
00:05:45,465 --> 00:05:46,651
it really works.

156
00:05:46,677 --> 00:05:48,100
It's like we have a do over.

157
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,701
Our sin is gone.

158
00:05:49,768 --> 00:05:51,101
So you don't have to keep
avoiding me.

159
00:05:51,155 --> 00:05:53,073
Yeah, I do. Until this thing
blows over, I do.

160
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:55,090
Javier Ruggero ?

161
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:59,012
Javier, uh, Ruggero ?

162
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,461
Blows over ?

163
00:06:00,948 --> 00:06:02,110
What does that even mean ?

164
00:06:02,126 --> 00:06:03,252
When Meredith and I, uh...

165
00:06:03,526 --> 00:06:05,630
eventually, you know,
it blew over. It passed.

166
00:06:05,808 --> 00:06:07,032
You mean the sad sex ?

167
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,802
The sad, tragic, depression-inducing sex
you had with Meredith

168
00:06:09,807 --> 00:06:11,451
- is the same as what...
- I can't.

169
00:06:12,216 --> 00:06:14,362
Okay ? Back off. Just for now,

170
00:06:15,017 --> 00:06:16,150
back off.

171
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:19,941
Javier... ruggero ?

172
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:21,732
You're Dr. Isobel Stevens ?

173
00:06:22,196 --> 00:06:22,862
Yes.

174
00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:25,541
Uh, if you're Mr. Ruggero, though,
you're with Dr. O'Malley.

175
00:06:25,557 --> 00:06:27,540
- Uh, Dr. Stevens...
- We, uh...

176
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:31,351
our d... our daughter has leukemia and

177
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,961
needs a bone marrow transplant.

178
00:06:33,086 --> 00:06:34,792
You, uh, you're looking for hematology.

179
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:35,980
It's third floor west...

180
00:06:36,008 --> 00:06:38,670
through these double doors,
second set of elevators on the...

181
00:06:39,727 --> 00:06:40,482
on the right.

182
00:06:42,707 --> 00:06:44,552
I'm so sorry about your daughter.

183
00:06:44,556 --> 00:06:46,112
But Seattle Grace has one of the best

184
00:06:46,138 --> 00:06:48,352
bone marrow transplant centers
in the country.

185
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:50,062
If you'd like, I can
take you up there myself.

186
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:51,542
No, no, it's just that

187
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:53,243
you look

188
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:55,333
so much like our daughter.

189
00:06:55,947 --> 00:06:58,052
We're Dustin and Caroline Klein.

190
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,863
We're Hannah's parents.

191
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:02,111
We're her...

192
00:07:03,227 --> 00:07:04,953
we're your daughter's parents.

193
00:07:05,536 --> 00:07:07,391
You're Hannah's birth mother.

194
00:07:10,107 --> 00:07:12,491
<i>S03e20
Ain't nothing but the real things<i>

195
00:07:13,877 --> 00:07:16,763
Hannah was diagnosed a few months ago
with acute myeloid leukemia.

196
00:07:16,818 --> 00:07:17,693
We, uh,

197
00:07:17,928 --> 00:07:20,021
we looked you up, and we know that
that's wrong, but...

198
00:07:20,047 --> 00:07:21,561
she needs the transplant.

199
00:07:21,657 --> 00:07:22,253
We...

200
00:07:22,368 --> 00:07:23,522
we were set to go.

201
00:07:23,545 --> 00:07:24,321
We had a donor.

202
00:07:24,335 --> 00:07:25,363
Yeah, her donor died.

203
00:07:25,408 --> 00:07:27,450
The registry called
Hannah's oncologist last night.

204
00:07:27,486 --> 00:07:29,881
'Cause apparently Hannah hasn't
had enough bad luck.

205
00:07:29,955 --> 00:07:31,000
And we'd never ask.

206
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:32,732
I mean, we had no intention
of bothering you, ever.

207
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:34,720
But last night, everything changed.

208
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:36,520
No. Of course.

209
00:07:37,537 --> 00:07:40,370
Of course I'd donate. It's just...

210
00:07:42,497 --> 00:07:46,130
a biological parent isn't usually a good
donor. I'm only a half match.

211
00:07:46,205 --> 00:07:49,900
Hannah would probably do better getting
back on the donor list and waiting.

212
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,301
I know...

213
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:56,100
when you gave her up,

214
00:07:56,535 --> 00:07:58,790
we promised to take care of her,

215
00:07:58,896 --> 00:07:59,933
to keep her safe,

216
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:03,612
but I... I can't protect her from this.

217
00:08:03,785 --> 00:08:04,943
It's genetic.

218
00:08:05,905 --> 00:08:07,560
You have to take care of her.

219
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:09,623
Every day we wait, she gets sicker.

220
00:08:09,725 --> 00:08:11,021
And... and if we're lucky,

221
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:13,711
you... you could be better
than a half match.

222
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:15,912
Yeah.

223
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,083
Is she...

224
00:08:20,017 --> 00:08:20,853
she's here ?

225
00:08:24,277 --> 00:08:25,833
God, she must be scared.

226
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:28,133
She's upstairs with my mother.

227
00:08:29,346 --> 00:08:30,141
Can I...

228
00:08:31,867 --> 00:08:32,460
um...

229
00:08:34,396 --> 00:08:36,212
I'd... I'd like to meet her.

230
00:08:36,237 --> 00:08:38,573
We... we'd have to check with Hannah.

231
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:38,983
But I...

232
00:08:39,497 --> 00:08:41,161
if she agrees,

233
00:08:41,325 --> 00:08:43,122
of course we'd be okay with it.

234
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:47,662
Isobel...

235
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:50,413
our daughter could die.

236
00:08:56,158 --> 00:08:56,722
Charles...

237
00:08:56,785 --> 00:08:58,133
this is Dr. Burke.

238
00:08:58,485 --> 00:09:00,330
I've invited him to assist
on the surgery.

239
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:01,833
How do you do, Dr. Burke ?

240
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:02,963
Oh, you're playing yourself ?

241
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:04,882
It distracts me from the fact

242
00:09:05,026 --> 00:09:07,713
that you're going to have your hands
in my chest in a few hours.

243
00:09:07,717 --> 00:09:10,651
And this, Charles, is a former student
of mine...

244
00:09:10,665 --> 00:09:12,560
a formidable chess player herself...

245
00:09:12,587 --> 00:09:15,342
- Dr. Cristina Yang.
- Soon to be Dr. Cristina Burke.

246
00:09:15,718 --> 00:09:16,892
We're getting married

247
00:09:16,996 --> 00:09:17,850
next month.

248
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:20,870
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

249
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,322
Perhaps you'd like to explain...

250
00:09:23,485 --> 00:09:24,392
the procedure,

251
00:09:24,658 --> 00:09:26,273
- Dr. Yang.
- Absolutely.

252
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:27,760
Mr. Redford,

253
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,833
instead of replacing your current heart,

254
00:09:30,855 --> 00:09:32,720
we're going to attach it
to the new heart,

255
00:09:32,787 --> 00:09:34,483
essentially piggybacking it.

256
00:09:34,547 --> 00:09:37,570
The two hearts pump together,
share the workload. It's, uh...

257
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:39,511
it's a perfect team.

258
00:09:40,218 --> 00:09:41,553
More accurately,

259
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:43,462
the new heart will circulate blood to
the body,

260
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:46,431
while the native heart will
pump blood to the lungs.

261
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:48,463
More of a divide-and-conquer approach.

262
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,930
Wouldn't you say, Dr. Yang ?

263
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:51,890
Sounds risky ?

264
00:09:51,906 --> 00:09:53,982
All surgeries carry a degree of risk,

265
00:09:54,037 --> 00:09:56,020
but Dr. Marlowe pioneered the procedure.

266
00:09:56,037 --> 00:09:59,722
And Dr. Burke is one of the foremost
cardiothoracic surgeons in the country.

267
00:09:59,727 --> 00:10:01,622
Well, I'll be the one
on point, of course.

268
00:10:01,628 --> 00:10:03,240
So you've nothing to worry about.

269
00:10:03,255 --> 00:10:06,752
You've picked the best man for the job.

270
00:10:08,318 --> 00:10:09,520
What was that ?

271
00:10:09,648 --> 00:10:13,781
That was my smug, passive-aggressive,
limey ex-boyfriend trying to show me

272
00:10:13,826 --> 00:10:15,162
I picked the wrong guy.

273
00:10:15,238 --> 00:10:16,582
I... I know, and I'm fine with it

274
00:10:16,605 --> 00:10:18,410
as long as I'm learning something.

275
00:10:18,437 --> 00:10:20,302
I was actually talking about you.

276
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:21,920
What was that ?

277
00:10:21,977 --> 00:10:23,873
You're gonna have to put up
with me being

278
00:10:23,938 --> 00:10:24,841
nice and sweet

279
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:25,843
for a little while.

280
00:10:26,535 --> 00:10:28,173
That'll be a nice change of pace.

281
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:29,302
Shut up.

282
00:10:29,908 --> 00:10:30,890
That's more like it.

283
00:10:32,226 --> 00:10:33,862
Hey, I saw Ava.

284
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:35,133
She looks terrific.

285
00:10:35,178 --> 00:10:37,783
Yeah, yeah, she does.
Sloan kicked it out.

286
00:10:37,878 --> 00:10:40,003
Yeah, well, you had something
to do with that, too.

287
00:10:40,045 --> 00:10:41,342
Just doing my job.

288
00:10:41,488 --> 00:10:44,302
Jeez. You cannot take a compliment.

289
00:10:44,638 --> 00:10:47,290
Well, I just don't want
people thinking...

290
00:10:47,305 --> 00:10:49,282
what, you're trying to build
the perfect woman ?

291
00:10:49,297 --> 00:10:50,413
Dr. Montgomery,

292
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:52,112
the police just called.
They're on their way over.

293
00:10:52,116 --> 00:10:53,890
They think they found Jane Doe's family.

294
00:10:54,747 --> 00:10:57,580
I'm sure you felt that you needed to be
even-handed when you announced

295
00:10:57,618 --> 00:10:59,410
that you were looking for someone
to take over as chief.

296
00:10:59,596 --> 00:11:01,542
Give everybody a shot at the brass ring.

297
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:02,772
I did.

298
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,540
Can we drop that ruse soon ?

299
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:05,152
It's not a ruse.

300
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,712
You promised me the job
when I came here.

301
00:11:06,755 --> 00:11:07,313
It's why I came here.

302
00:11:07,337 --> 00:11:09,262
No, you came because your marriage
fell apart

303
00:11:09,265 --> 00:11:11,073
- and you had to get the hell out of dodge.
- We had an understanding,

304
00:11:11,118 --> 00:11:12,372
and now you're having me jump
through hoops

305
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,802
with every other attending
in this hospital.

306
00:11:13,826 --> 00:11:16,681
And I hear you're giving Marlowe special
privileges to do a piggyback surgery.

307
00:11:16,716 --> 00:11:18,672
This is a teaching hospital, Derek.

308
00:11:19,757 --> 00:11:20,131
Yeah.

309
00:11:22,656 --> 00:11:24,640
My interview didn't go
as well as I had hoped.

310
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:26,280
I would like your support
with the board.

311
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:27,773
You know my credentials.
You know I'm ready.

312
00:11:27,797 --> 00:11:29,741
- I only have one vote.
- It's a strong vote.

313
00:11:34,938 --> 00:11:36,100
I'm not feeling well.

314
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,231
What's wrong with that girl ?

315
00:11:50,155 --> 00:11:52,610
Oh, look, I can't talk to you when
you're making all that noise,

316
00:11:53,108 --> 00:11:54,883
so pull it together and get out here.

317
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,521
Now.

318
00:12:11,136 --> 00:12:12,972
I have an 11-year-old daughter.

319
00:12:15,088 --> 00:12:18,080
She needs a bone marrow transplant.

320
00:12:19,526 --> 00:12:21,391
I'm potentially a good match.

321
00:12:23,395 --> 00:12:25,040
Please don't tell anybody. Please.

322
00:12:25,075 --> 00:12:26,742
This isn't a chapter
of my history that...

323
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,710
I understand.

324
00:12:34,118 --> 00:12:35,303
She's here...

325
00:12:36,477 --> 00:12:37,611
my kid...

326
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:41,661
and I'm supposed to go up
to pediatrics and meet her

327
00:12:41,846 --> 00:12:42,813
right now, and...

328
00:12:46,685 --> 00:12:48,751
I mean, I've thought about
this moment...

329
00:12:49,997 --> 00:12:52,721
wh... what I would look like...

330
00:12:54,297 --> 00:12:55,723
what I would say.

331
00:12:58,347 --> 00:13:00,243
But I thought I would be older,

332
00:13:00,537 --> 00:13:02,121
more together, more mature.

333
00:13:02,645 --> 00:13:06,510
I thought she would be older. And I
never thought that she would be sick.

334
00:13:10,425 --> 00:13:12,540
Oh, God. I don't know what to do.

335
00:13:13,838 --> 00:13:16,182
God, I don't know what to do.
What do I do ?

336
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,332
We love our Shannon,

337
00:13:21,387 --> 00:13:22,311
but we

338
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,652
never got along wither husband.

339
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:27,070
- So she has a husband ?
- Had.

340
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:28,770
One day while she was at work, he

341
00:13:28,805 --> 00:13:30,092
packed up and disappeared.

342
00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:31,332
He didn't want a baby.

343
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,310
But she went after him,
even pregnant like that.

344
00:13:34,376 --> 00:13:37,141
We hadn't heard from her in months,
and then today we

345
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,651
saw her picture on tv.

346
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,951
Mr. and Mrs. Waring, uh, the woman we
found, if she is your daughter...

347
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:42,400
Well,

348
00:13:43,205 --> 00:13:45,722
her nose is different, and her chin, but

349
00:13:45,886 --> 00:13:48,682
they said that her face had been,
you know, changed.

350
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,720
Do you happen to know
your daughter's blood type ?

351
00:13:51,186 --> 00:13:52,643
She's B positive.

352
00:13:52,687 --> 00:13:55,692
Any medical conditions, surgeries
we should know about ?

353
00:13:55,705 --> 00:13:58,591
Um, she had her tonsils out
when she was 12.

354
00:14:00,245 --> 00:14:01,520
It's her, isn't it ?

355
00:14:01,847 --> 00:14:03,101
It's Shannon.

356
00:14:08,576 --> 00:14:09,243
Susan.

357
00:14:09,885 --> 00:14:10,910
Meredith, hi.

358
00:14:10,995 --> 00:14:13,193
I'm so glad I found you.
Twice in one day.

359
00:14:13,237 --> 00:14:14,101
Is this a bad time ?

360
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:15,362
I mean, I know you're always busy, but...

361
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:16,531
Yeah, no, I'm busy. I'm at work.

362
00:14:16,546 --> 00:14:18,500
Okay, I was, um...

363
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,742
you knowI'd really just love
to talk with you.

364
00:14:20,757 --> 00:14:23,573
- I would love to find a time for you
and me to sit down...
- I'm sorry.

365
00:14:24,387 --> 00:14:25,283
This is too much.

366
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,501
Way too much.

367
00:14:26,536 --> 00:14:27,460
You keep showing up.

368
00:14:27,606 --> 00:14:28,800
I cannot be your daughter

369
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,521
or your charity case
or the thing that you need to fix.

370
00:14:31,897 --> 00:14:35,103
- I'm not trying to...
- No, no. Stop talking, okay ?

371
00:14:35,298 --> 00:14:36,471
Stop mothering.

372
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:37,681
Just stop.

373
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:43,361
She is mid-30s, brunette
and 8 months pregnant.

374
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:45,681
If you recognize her, please...

375
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,591
My glamour shot's been on the news
at least a dozen times already.

376
00:14:49,686 --> 00:14:52,680
Admit it... You're gonna miss me when my
fancy family shows up to take me away.

377
00:14:52,736 --> 00:14:53,783
You don't know they're fancy.

378
00:14:54,096 --> 00:14:54,573
Open up.

379
00:14:55,347 --> 00:14:56,482
Why, what's wrong
with my throat ?

380
00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:58,872
How would I know? I haven't even
seen it yet. Now open up.

381
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,102
No, not till you tell me...

382
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:02,070
Wait.

383
00:15:03,576 --> 00:15:05,803
Someone has recognized me,
haven't they ?

384
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:09,321
Alex... Alex, you have to
tell me who it is

385
00:15:09,585 --> 00:15:10,120
please.

386
00:15:10,315 --> 00:15:12,121
Their daughter's blood type
is b-positive.

387
00:15:12,507 --> 00:15:14,513
She's your age. She's pregnant.
Your height,

388
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:15,470
your hair color,

389
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,271
and she has no tonsils.

390
00:15:17,896 --> 00:15:18,850
So now are you gonna open up ?

391
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,852
Yes. Please tell me
I have no tonsils.

392
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:22,001
- Say ah.
- Ah.

393
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:26,310
No tonsils.

394
00:15:26,735 --> 00:15:27,661
Shannon ?

395
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:31,872
Mr. And mrs. Waring, I asked you
to wait. I have tests to complete

396
00:15:31,677 --> 00:15:32,471
Alex...

397
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:34,071
It's okay.

398
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,683
Your name...

399
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:42,191
- is Shannon Marie.
- Marie was my mother's name...

400
00:15:42,757 --> 00:15:45,122
your grandmother.

401
00:15:45,936 --> 00:15:48,120
Shannon Marie.

402
00:15:53,668 --> 00:15:56,081
Okay, discharge
beds one and three.

403
00:15:56,148 --> 00:15:57,281
Two needs a social worker.

404
00:15:57,305 --> 00:15:59,932
Hold this down for me, O'Malley.
I'm gonna be out for a while.

405
00:16:00,218 --> 00:16:01,252
Why ?

406
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:02,531
What's going on with Izzie ?

407
00:16:02,577 --> 00:16:05,112
What's going on with Stevens
is none of your concern.

408
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,060
What is your concern ?
Sick people...

409
00:16:07,106 --> 00:16:09,751
all these sick people...
until I get back. Understand ?

410
00:16:10,997 --> 00:16:11,670
Dr. Bailey,

411
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,510
just did a consult in trauma one.

412
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:14,840
The guy has a perf.
Can I scrub in ?

413
00:16:14,866 --> 00:16:16,263
No, you cannot scrub in.

414
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:18,200
Uh, you're here with O'Malley for now.

415
00:16:22,345 --> 00:16:24,331
Hey, what's wrong with Izzie ?

416
00:16:24,998 --> 00:16:28,971
Beds 7 through 13. Start with number 8.
He doesn't have much bladder control.

417
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:33,251
First, mr. Redford, while dr. Marlowe is
preparing the surgical area,

418
00:16:33,335 --> 00:16:35,021
I will be examining
the donor heart.

419
00:16:35,187 --> 00:16:37,703
Actually, I'm sorry.
I'll examine the donor heart.

420
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:40,732
I want to be sure
the I.V.C. Orifice is oversewn.

421
00:16:44,007 --> 00:16:45,430
Well, carry on.

422
00:16:45,777 --> 00:16:49,081
Then I'll open your chest
and put you on bypass,

423
00:16:49,137 --> 00:16:51,472
at which point we will
connect the left atrium

424
00:16:51,546 --> 00:16:53,833
- then the right atrium...
- Superior vena cava.

425
00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:56,943
It simplifies the subsequent
cardiac biopsies.

426
00:16:57,067 --> 00:17:00,973
You didn't read my article in the
"cardiothoracic monthly" last year.

427
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:02,210
Did you ? Huh ?

428
00:17:02,317 --> 00:17:04,601
Well, I think Cristina has
a copy of it. Cristina,

429
00:17:04,736 --> 00:17:05,981
- may I ?
- Oh, of course.

430
00:17:09,698 --> 00:17:12,911
Oh, what on earth is that ?

431
00:17:13,348 --> 00:17:15,210
Oh, testing colors.

432
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,871
For the big day, I assume ?

433
00:17:17,095 --> 00:17:18,251
I'm thinking, um,

434
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:19,781
coral.

435
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,943
Hey, chief, come here.
I want to show you something.

436
00:17:23,427 --> 00:17:24,541
I'm busy, Sloan.

437
00:17:24,587 --> 00:17:26,943
I need an update on my patient
in room 3129.

438
00:17:26,985 --> 00:17:27,582
Oh, hi.

439
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:27,972
Hi.

440
00:17:28,116 --> 00:17:28,703
Okay.

441
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:29,962
I have that right here.

442
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:33,960
I like those sneakers.

443
00:17:34,077 --> 00:17:34,891
You a runner ?

444
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:35,863
Yeah.

445
00:17:36,418 --> 00:17:37,203
Me, too.

446
00:17:37,358 --> 00:17:39,403
Maybe we should
go running some time.

447
00:17:40,596 --> 00:17:41,201
Sure.

448
00:17:42,425 --> 00:17:45,283
Anything else I can
help you with, dr. Sloan ?

449
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:46,733
No. All good.

450
00:17:50,477 --> 00:17:51,461
Wingman.

451
00:17:52,975 --> 00:17:53,980
Wingman.

452
00:17:55,478 --> 00:17:58,541
- Hannah is in there right now ?
- She is.

453
00:18:05,896 --> 00:18:08,683
You see her,
you'll know what to do.

454
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:13,751
Must be nice to know she has parents
like this, who fight for her, think about

455
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:17,781
what she wants, try to make her happy
like you would've.

456
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,942
Doesn't mean you don't want
that girl to want you.

457
00:18:26,926 --> 00:18:27,410
Yeah.

458
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:37,880
I'm...

459
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:40,991
she's so, so tired.

460
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:44,421
We left it up to Hannah, and, uh,
she's just not ready. I'm sorry.

461
00:18:44,545 --> 00:18:45,640
We don't want to force it.

462
00:18:45,968 --> 00:18:48,292
- Maybe another time ?
- When she's feeling better.

463
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:49,100
No, of course.

464
00:18:49,985 --> 00:18:50,481
I understand.

465
00:18:52,477 --> 00:18:53,741
I'm sorry, but...

466
00:18:54,338 --> 00:18:55,371
the transplant ?

467
00:18:58,455 --> 00:18:59,662
Stevens.

468
00:19:02,245 --> 00:19:04,253
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.

469
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:07,820
Your girl... you can want her
to want you all day long,

470
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:10,663
but she has to be here if she's ever
gonna have that chance again.

471
00:19:15,437 --> 00:19:16,333
I'm sorry.

472
00:19:16,987 --> 00:19:19,043
Of course. Yeah.
I'm ready. Let's get started.

473
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:24,541
Hey guess what. I'm a teacher.

474
00:19:24,926 --> 00:19:27,140
I teach second grade

475
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,760
at North Bend Elementary.
Or at least I did

476
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,203
- until...
- you can get your job back
whenever you want.

477
00:19:32,398 --> 00:19:34,913
They love you there. When will
we be able to take her home ?

478
00:19:35,528 --> 00:19:37,181
You want to take her back to...

479
00:19:37,206 --> 00:19:39,112
North Bend. We've got a room
all setup for her.

480
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:42,270
Your mom's got all of your books
and your letters and diaries.

481
00:19:42,335 --> 00:19:43,850
I kept diaries ?

482
00:19:43,935 --> 00:19:45,011
about 800 of them.

483
00:19:45,338 --> 00:19:47,212
So even if you don't
remember everything now,

484
00:19:47,468 --> 00:19:48,152
you will.

485
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,341
You hear that ?

486
00:19:52,427 --> 00:19:53,361
I can go, right ?

487
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:55,261
Well, you're still getting
I.V. Antibiotics,

488
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:57,483
and we're monitoring the baby
very closely right now.

489
00:19:57,545 --> 00:19:59,541
Yeah, but you can
make it happen, right ?

490
00:20:01,027 --> 00:20:03,083
Come on, Alex.
Don't doctor me.

491
00:20:03,198 --> 00:20:04,132
Help me get outta here.

492
00:20:04,145 --> 00:20:06,493
Dr. Montgomery's got you
on strict bed rest until your delivery.

493
00:20:09,486 --> 00:20:11,951
But I'll ask. Maybe... maybe you
can do it from home.

494
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:13,351
Home.

495
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:18,932
- Hey.
- Hey.

496
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:20,541
- You okay ? You look...
- horrible.

497
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,580
I'm in a horrible mood.

498
00:20:21,827 --> 00:20:23,653
I yelled at Susan.
I think I scared off

499
00:20:23,766 --> 00:20:25,120
my fake mommy forever.

500
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:28,500
- Need cheering up ?
- No.

501
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:31,743
Me either.
It's gonna be ok.

502
00:20:32,195 --> 00:20:33,982
- You think ?
- Yeah, Susan will be okay.

503
00:20:40,927 --> 00:20:41,981
How'd it go with the chief ?

504
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:45,003
- About as well as you and Susan.
- Wow. We make a good team.

505
00:20:50,977 --> 00:20:53,142
I've been waiting for you in
really-old-guy's room for 20 minutes.

506
00:20:53,215 --> 00:20:53,731
What gives ?

507
00:20:53,775 --> 00:20:55,891
Sorry. We decided
to eat down here today.

508
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:56,873
Nobody told me.

509
00:20:56,925 --> 00:20:57,452
Anybody...

510
00:20:58,475 --> 00:20:59,180
move.

511
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:01,103
Anybody know what's
going on with Izzie ?

512
00:21:01,948 --> 00:21:03,233
Something's going on.

513
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:05,150
Why don't you
just ask her yourself ?

514
00:21:05,345 --> 00:21:07,041
Fine. I would if I knew
where she was.

515
00:21:07,468 --> 00:21:08,450
I brought you lunch.

516
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,280
You've got stuff
on your hands.

517
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:16,243
I'm trying to scare
away cardio God.

518
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:17,493
With pretty, pretty fingers ?

519
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:19,211
He takes my rook,
I take his bishop.

520
00:21:19,727 --> 00:21:20,551
Hey, pouty head.

521
00:21:20,835 --> 00:21:23,930
Oh, are you so sad 'cause no-face
girl's family is taking her home ?

522
00:21:23,957 --> 00:21:25,123
Really? Someone claimed Ava?

523
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:26,121
Yeah, her parents.

524
00:21:26,216 --> 00:21:27,401
She must be so relieved.

525
00:21:27,518 --> 00:21:28,382
Yeah, unless they suck.

526
00:21:28,756 --> 00:21:31,033
Can you imagine, you can't remember
a family, and they show up,

527
00:21:31,896 --> 00:21:33,250
and it turns out
they're psycho killers ?

528
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:34,973
- Or over sharers.
- Whatever.

529
00:21:35,197 --> 00:21:35,702
She's a patient.

530
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:37,882
I don't give a crap who her
parents are, where she goes.

531
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:39,092
Can we move on ?

532
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:40,891
One second.

533
00:21:43,456 --> 00:21:44,203
What's up with Izzie ?

534
00:21:44,285 --> 00:21:45,661
D... I told you, it's none
of your concern.

535
00:21:45,678 --> 00:21:47,392
No, it is my concern.
I demand to know.

536
00:21:48,188 --> 00:21:50,731
I hope I didn't just hear you
say you demand.

537
00:21:50,996 --> 00:21:51,883
Well, are you her father ?

538
00:21:52,296 --> 00:21:53,321
Are you her husband?

539
00:21:53,706 --> 00:21:56,453
Then stay here and keep
your mind on your job.

540
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:57,031
You hear me ?

541
00:21:59,346 --> 00:22:00,092
Grey.

542
00:22:02,017 --> 00:22:03,792
Look, I need to be
upstairs, so

543
00:22:04,127 --> 00:22:06,323
do not let this
out of your sight.

544
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:08,002
Walk this to the lab,

545
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:09,573
watch the lab run the test,

546
00:22:09,656 --> 00:22:12,392
bring the test results
directly to me, nobody else.

547
00:22:15,718 --> 00:22:17,471
It's Izzie.
What's the matter ?

548
00:22:17,596 --> 00:22:20,362
You will be discreet
and not ask a bunch of questions.

549
00:22:20,436 --> 00:22:22,161
Now this is a private matter.

550
00:22:22,218 --> 00:22:24,410
She needs these results now.

551
00:22:25,008 --> 00:22:25,601
Okay.

552
00:22:35,675 --> 00:22:37,542
Wow. That's a big needle.

553
00:22:37,645 --> 00:22:38,483
It's standard.

554
00:22:38,548 --> 00:22:42,420
You should start to feel numb about ten
minutes after I inject the lidocaine, okay ?

555
00:22:42,506 --> 00:22:46,373
Yeah. No, I know. I've given epidurals
before. I know that's the needle.

556
00:22:47,128 --> 00:22:49,371
It's just that somehow
it seems so much bigger

557
00:22:49,497 --> 00:22:50,670
now that it's going
into my spine.

558
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:51,492
Little stick.

559
00:22:51,808 --> 00:22:52,423
Oh, my God.

560
00:22:52,777 --> 00:22:54,040
You sure I can't call someone ?

561
00:22:54,057 --> 00:22:56,763
One of your friends? You're gonna
need somebody to hold your hand.

562
00:22:57,546 --> 00:22:57,913
No.

563
00:22:59,077 --> 00:22:59,852
Thank you.

564
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,222
You sure ?

565
00:23:06,848 --> 00:23:09,661
Yeah, well, I can take
a lot of pressure, just...

566
00:23:09,998 --> 00:23:12,210
it's rough as sandpaper.

567
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:15,250
A little pressure.

568
00:23:19,818 --> 00:23:20,382
Meredith...

569
00:23:21,126 --> 00:23:21,961
tell me where she is.

570
00:23:21,975 --> 00:23:24,500
- I can't. If she wanted you to know, George
- She does. She just...

571
00:23:25,836 --> 00:23:27,461
We're just having
one of our stupid fights.

572
00:23:29,197 --> 00:23:31,480
Do you know how wrong it is if she's
really in trouble and I'm not there

573
00:23:31,496 --> 00:23:32,931
because we're being idiots ?

574
00:23:34,485 --> 00:23:35,333
Come on.

575
00:23:36,158 --> 00:23:37,271
Meredith, please.

576
00:23:39,595 --> 00:23:42,051
She's upstairs
in procedure room "A."

577
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,430
- That's all I know.
- Thank you.

578
00:23:48,776 --> 00:23:49,740
So...

579
00:23:50,288 --> 00:23:52,093
Dr. Montgomery says you can
take your daughter home.

580
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:54,542
But she wants to talk to
her local O.B.-G.Y.N.

581
00:23:54,605 --> 00:23:55,830
There are some things
she wants to go over

582
00:23:55,998 --> 00:23:56,773
before we release her.

583
00:23:56,965 --> 00:23:57,793
I can't.

584
00:23:58,756 --> 00:23:59,873
Okay. Well,

585
00:24:00,135 --> 00:24:01,843
I can go through all this
with your husband if...

586
00:24:01,915 --> 00:24:03,581
No, you don't understand.

587
00:24:04,786 --> 00:24:06,152
I can't take her home.

588
00:24:09,017 --> 00:24:11,131
That girl is not my daughter.

589
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:16,213
She does look an

590
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,813
awful lot like Shannon.

591
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:20,660
Sometimes she even

592
00:24:20,986 --> 00:24:22,103
sounds like her.

593
00:24:22,957 --> 00:24:26,011
You know, with the surgery
and, the loss of memories...

594
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,983
a mother knows
her own child, dr. Karev,

595
00:24:29,216 --> 00:24:31,190
and that is not my child.

596
00:24:31,525 --> 00:24:32,953
- But your husband, he's...
- Look,

597
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:36,553
if that's not Shannon, we still
don't know where our girl is.

598
00:24:36,846 --> 00:24:37,793
Do you understand ?

599
00:24:38,016 --> 00:24:39,923
He needs it to be her.

600
00:24:41,837 --> 00:24:45,182
How am i supposed to tell him ?
How do I tell either of them ?

601
00:24:45,355 --> 00:24:48,273
- Mrs. Waring...
- dr. Karev...

602
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:52,262
would you ask my husband
to meet me in the lobby ?

603
00:24:52,838 --> 00:24:55,900
- You need to face her.
- Please... tell her I'm sorry.

604
00:25:00,406 --> 00:25:01,620
Things have changed.

605
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:03,571
No, no. Nothing has changed.

606
00:25:03,796 --> 00:25:05,693
I deserve your support, Richard.
Tell me I have it.

607
00:25:05,776 --> 00:25:06,940
Tell me I didn't move
to Seattle for nothing.

608
00:25:06,997 --> 00:25:08,811
You moved to Seattle
to start a new life,

609
00:25:09,755 --> 00:25:10,783
and you did.

610
00:25:11,907 --> 00:25:13,520
You have a fantastic woman
who loves you.

611
00:25:13,538 --> 00:25:15,510
This is not about my personal life.
This is about my career.

612
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:16,961
Do you know what being chief
will do to your life ?

613
00:25:17,095 --> 00:25:19,521
Why the hell do you think
I'm getting a divorce

614
00:25:20,036 --> 00:25:21,632
or dyeing my hair ?

615
00:25:22,478 --> 00:25:23,763
You can't do it all,

616
00:25:24,057 --> 00:25:25,812
- not if you want to be chief.
- You couldn't do it all.

617
00:25:25,847 --> 00:25:27,923
- And neither can you.
- Don't put your mistake on me.

618
00:25:28,147 --> 00:25:29,813
Don't. I am the best
candidate for this job.

619
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,072
You know it, and I know it,

620
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:32,220
and that is the only factor

621
00:25:32,246 --> 00:25:33,921
you need to take into
consideration here. I don't

622
00:25:34,257 --> 00:25:35,813
need your protection, Richard,
and I don't want it.

623
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:37,361
I'm not trying
to protect you, Derek.

624
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:38,693
I told Ellis...

625
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:43,951
I promised her

626
00:25:44,657 --> 00:25:46,053
that I would look after her daughter.

627
00:25:55,808 --> 00:25:58,210
O'Malley, did Stevens
ask for you here ?

628
00:25:58,246 --> 00:25:59,640
No! No, I did not.

629
00:25:59,876 --> 00:26:01,860
- Then you need to turn yourself around.
- You're giving bone marrow ?

630
00:26:01,966 --> 00:26:03,080
This is a private matter.

631
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,511
I'm not leaving.

632
00:26:04,735 --> 00:26:05,472
- George.
- No.

633
00:26:07,658 --> 00:26:08,663
Make me.

634
00:26:09,178 --> 00:26:11,723
- Hey !
- Sorry, I'm starting now.
- Just...

635
00:26:12,508 --> 00:26:14,112
let me know when you're
gonna do stuff, okay ?

636
00:26:16,235 --> 00:26:16,680
you're okay.

637
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:20,873
I got it here.

638
00:26:26,575 --> 00:26:28,083
Fine. Stevens, I'm going.

639
00:26:28,298 --> 00:26:29,591
Unless you need me
to call security.

640
00:26:30,658 --> 00:26:31,623
I'll manage.

641
00:26:34,378 --> 00:26:35,450
Thank you.

642
00:26:42,937 --> 00:26:43,903
You said back off.

643
00:26:43,927 --> 00:26:45,783
You didn't tell me you were having
a hole drilled in your damn hip.

644
00:26:48,647 --> 00:26:50,113
For who ?

645
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:55,160
What's this private matter ?

646
00:26:56,387 --> 00:26:59,172
Okay, I'm going in
when you're ready.

647
00:26:59,635 --> 00:27:00,832
Ready ?

648
00:27:10,527 --> 00:27:11,783
Hey, Callie.

649
00:27:12,168 --> 00:27:12,552
Hey.

650
00:27:12,917 --> 00:27:14,671
so if you could
just take these two,

651
00:27:14,748 --> 00:27:16,280
- then that'll free me up...
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

652
00:27:16,348 --> 00:27:18,631
No, I'm not here to work.
I'm... I'm... I'm, uh,

653
00:27:18,768 --> 00:27:20,643
I'm... I'm sorry.
I haven't slept in like two days,

654
00:27:20,675 --> 00:27:21,963
and, uh, I'm actually
looking for George.

655
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:22,811
We're supposed to meet up for coffee.

656
00:27:23,397 --> 00:27:24,243
- Oh.
- So...

657
00:27:24,945 --> 00:27:27,181
he's, with Izzie, I think.

658
00:27:27,248 --> 00:27:30,102
So if you're not here to work,
I'm just gonna take these back. Thanks.

659
00:27:35,198 --> 00:27:36,310
15-blade.

660
00:27:38,048 --> 00:27:39,040
Suction, please.

661
00:27:41,475 --> 00:27:44,493
Dr. Burke, you're not using
the superior transseptal approach

662
00:27:44,527 --> 00:27:45,931
for the atriotomy, are you ?

663
00:27:46,378 --> 00:27:47,002
Is that a problem?

664
00:27:47,226 --> 00:27:48,330
Not at all unless

665
00:27:48,486 --> 00:27:49,993
your intention is to kill the patient.

666
00:27:53,237 --> 00:27:54,211
Dr. Marlowe, from what I've read...

667
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:56,210
Yes, well, reading about
a procedure is one thing and, uh,

668
00:27:56,286 --> 00:27:57,440
performing it is quite another.

669
00:27:57,478 --> 00:28:00,000
It was my mistake. I should never
have allowed you to scrub in.

670
00:28:00,326 --> 00:28:01,800
I think it best
from this point on

671
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:04,282
that you simply observe.

672
00:28:10,118 --> 00:28:11,810
Suction, please.

673
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:15,040
Hurry up.

674
00:28:18,725 --> 00:28:21,532
You should use the wheelchair.
You're gonna be sore.

675
00:28:21,807 --> 00:28:22,643
I'm aware.

676
00:28:23,275 --> 00:28:25,260
I'm fine now. Thank you.

677
00:28:26,556 --> 00:28:28,343
Uh, you mean
pantless but fine ?

678
00:28:28,895 --> 00:28:30,011
Crap.

679
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,121
stand.

680
00:29:00,717 --> 00:29:02,441
- I got it.
- Okay.

681
00:29:15,048 --> 00:29:20,913
Hannah... an 11 year old girl.
That's the private matter. She's mine.

682
00:29:22,617 --> 00:29:23,622
Don't...

683
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:26,672
don't look at me.

684
00:29:31,857 --> 00:29:33,630
My mother wanted me to keep her.

685
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:40,503
But I knew even at 16...
I knew that baby deserved better

686
00:29:41,186 --> 00:29:44,420
than life... at a chehalis trailer park.

687
00:29:46,068 --> 00:29:47,451
And now she's here

688
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:52,463
and she might be dying
and she doesn't want to meet me.

689
00:29:57,535 --> 00:29:59,270
Oh, crap.

690
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:06,683
I didn't think I really cared
until she said no.

691
00:30:08,878 --> 00:30:11,470
How about that ?

692
00:30:21,115 --> 00:30:23,151
I can say hail mary's until...

693
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:28,053
until I turn into mary,
but I still miss you.

694
00:30:29,645 --> 00:30:30,971
Not the...

695
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,890
the sex.

696
00:30:36,746 --> 00:30:39,150
It was not tragic, George.

697
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,791
But I'll live without it.

698
00:30:44,307 --> 00:30:47,071
I won't make it
if you can't be my friend.

699
00:30:48,418 --> 00:30:49,932
If we can't...

700
00:30:58,526 --> 00:31:00,210
What you did today...

701
00:31:00,956 --> 00:31:02,271
You should be proud.

702
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:08,630
I'll get an orderly
to take you downstairs.

703
00:31:08,896 --> 00:31:09,652
But I have to go.

704
00:31:14,325 --> 00:31:15,471
You understand ?

705
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:50,181
Some surgery.

706
00:31:51,516 --> 00:31:53,681
- And Colin was a compl...
- Brilliant.

707
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:56,313
He's a gifted surgeon.

708
00:32:01,016 --> 00:32:03,022
Listen, I had a question.

709
00:32:04,095 --> 00:32:07,363
When you moved the atrium to
the vena cava, why did you switch

710
00:32:07,555 --> 00:32:09,490
from 3-0 to 5-0 sutures ?

711
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:13,663
You want to use the finest sutures
you can for vascular structures.

712
00:32:14,216 --> 00:32:14,942
A delicate

713
00:32:15,735 --> 00:32:17,250
tissue demands a delicate touch.

714
00:32:18,777 --> 00:32:19,461
Right.

715
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:21,470
That makes sense.

716
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:22,641
Thank you.

717
00:32:23,637 --> 00:32:24,730
Of course.

718
00:32:26,336 --> 00:32:27,891
- I'll see you at home ?
- Yeah.

719
00:32:38,288 --> 00:32:40,542
- How long have you been standing there ?
- Long enough.

720
00:32:40,976 --> 00:32:42,630
We've been playing our
little game all day long.

721
00:32:43,897 --> 00:32:45,080
But what I just saw...

722
00:32:46,845 --> 00:32:47,510
that was real.

723
00:32:47,856 --> 00:32:49,422
The question you asked him
about the sutures,

724
00:32:49,597 --> 00:32:51,571
that was from my paper,
the paper you helped me write.

725
00:32:51,768 --> 00:32:53,131
You already knew the answer.

726
00:32:55,186 --> 00:32:56,760
The Cristina Yang I knew...

727
00:32:57,857 --> 00:32:59,922
was concerned with excellence.

728
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:02,411
She would never play the

729
00:33:02,825 --> 00:33:05,620
part of the helpless girl trying to
build up a grown man's ego.

730
00:33:05,808 --> 00:33:06,660
What has become of you ?

731
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:08,212
I have learned that sometimes

732
00:33:08,788 --> 00:33:10,540
you have to think about
other people.

733
00:33:11,286 --> 00:33:13,431
- You've compromised yourself.
- No.

734
00:33:14,818 --> 00:33:15,990
I'm going home.

735
00:33:16,315 --> 00:33:17,813
You're right.
It's senseless,

736
00:33:18,245 --> 00:33:20,353
coming here, chasing after a job
that was beneath me

737
00:33:20,536 --> 00:33:22,092
just so I could be near
a woman who...

738
00:33:24,318 --> 00:33:26,763
a woman who apparently
no longer exists.

739
00:33:31,818 --> 00:33:34,170
Best of luck...
with the wedding.

740
00:33:47,415 --> 00:33:48,940
No, there they are.

741
00:33:50,308 --> 00:33:51,230
I can't.

742
00:33:52,475 --> 00:33:53,670
I can't.
You look.

743
00:33:54,318 --> 00:33:56,163
- Please. You look for me.
- Okay

744
00:34:00,665 --> 00:34:03,280
She's getting the infusion.
You did it.

745
00:34:03,545 --> 00:34:04,380
Is she, um...

746
00:34:06,235 --> 00:34:07,043
How does she look ?

747
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:09,230
You can... You can see for yourself.

748
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:10,813
It's okay.
She can't see us from here.

749
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:20,620
She's got your eyes...

750
00:34:21,345 --> 00:34:22,453
and your mouth.

751
00:34:25,545 --> 00:34:28,543
that means she probably
talks a lot and eats a lot then.

752
00:34:34,225 --> 00:34:36,232
If she's in pain,
she's not letting on.

753
00:34:38,206 --> 00:34:42,222
Man, she's tough.

754
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:03,020
That's her, George.
That's Hannah.

755
00:35:07,765 --> 00:35:12,300
She's beautiful, don't you think ?
She's really... beautiful.

756
00:35:12,788 --> 00:35:13,421
Yeah.

757
00:35:15,176 --> 00:35:16,990
Yeah, she's a heartbreaker.

758
00:35:26,696 --> 00:35:27,951
You need some help with that ?

759
00:35:28,345 --> 00:35:31,461
I know you didn't just wander in here
to help me change pillowcases.

760
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:34,430
You warned me she could
become a problem.

761
00:35:34,636 --> 00:35:35,131
Who, meredith ?

762
00:35:37,378 --> 00:35:38,380
You love somebody,

763
00:35:38,688 --> 00:35:39,841
You think you can handle it all.

764
00:35:40,115 --> 00:35:41,573
You've done all right.
Both of you

765
00:35:41,768 --> 00:35:43,341
I came out here
to be chief,

766
00:35:44,365 --> 00:35:45,642
and Meredith
complicates that.

767
00:35:47,097 --> 00:35:49,012
Well, if this turns into an either/or,

768
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:52,051
you pick the person you love,
end of story.

769
00:35:53,397 --> 00:35:57,401
Look, all of this means
nothing if you're alone.

770
00:36:07,577 --> 00:36:09,170
oh, Crap !

771
00:36:09,716 --> 00:36:13,552
Our coffee. I'm... I'm sorry.
I've... I forgot. I got...

772
00:36:14,475 --> 00:36:16,763
- I got so busy...
- Oh, yeah ? With what ?

773
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:20,653
Oh, j... the clinic, patients and...
Well, you know how it is.

774
00:36:23,998 --> 00:36:25,590
Oh, man.

775
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:29,522
Yeah, I know how it is, so...

776
00:36:30,287 --> 00:36:33,671
I'm really tired. I'm really, really tired.
So I'll just... I'll see you at home.

777
00:36:34,255 --> 00:36:34,691
Okay.

778
00:36:34,988 --> 00:36:35,340
Okay.

779
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:36,970
Okay, okay.

780
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:42,012
Solitaire.

781
00:36:42,425 --> 00:36:43,350
My dad taught me.

782
00:36:43,508 --> 00:36:44,582
That sounds so weird.

783
00:36:45,076 --> 00:36:45,803
"My dad."

784
00:36:47,277 --> 00:36:48,371
Good weird, though.

785
00:36:48,818 --> 00:36:51,052
So you and the redhead
gonna let me go home ?

786
00:36:51,155 --> 00:36:53,492
Or were you too busy making eyes
at each other to even ask ?

787
00:36:55,816 --> 00:36:56,493
What?

788
00:36:57,596 --> 00:36:59,081
- Ava...
- No.

789
00:36:59,915 --> 00:37:00,872
It's Shannon.

790
00:37:01,937 --> 00:37:04,652
- Listen...
- My name is Shannon. Shannon Marie.

791
00:37:07,085 --> 00:37:07,953
I'm sorry.

792
00:37:14,218 --> 00:37:15,861
Those are supposed
to be my people.

793
00:37:16,886 --> 00:37:19,032
I belong with them, Alex.

794
00:37:19,305 --> 00:37:20,483
I'm supposed to go

795
00:37:20,848 --> 00:37:21,253
with them.

796
00:37:21,266 --> 00:37:23,153
Your people, we... We don't
even know who they are yet.

797
00:37:23,166 --> 00:37:24,663
You don't want to find them.

798
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:27,441
You want to keep me all to yourself.
Well, here I am,

799
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:28,992
your pathetic

800
00:37:29,257 --> 00:37:30,550
captive audience.

801
00:37:30,797 --> 00:37:33,451
Isn't it sad that I'm
the best you can do ?

802
00:37:34,025 --> 00:37:36,091
- Ava...
- My name is not Ava!

803
00:37:36,238 --> 00:37:38,241
You made it up !
It's not me !

804
00:37:38,997 --> 00:37:39,951
Get out!

805
00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:41,191
Get out !

806
00:37:45,328 --> 00:37:48,091
<i>Some people believe
that without history,<i>

807
00:37:48,507 --> 00:37:50,342
<i>our lives amount to nothing.<i>

808
00:37:51,698 --> 00:37:52,353
Sloan,

809
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:54,392
you brought me to a bar.

810
00:37:54,598 --> 00:37:56,252
- You know I don't drink.
- Which is perfect.

811
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,122
Better to keep your mind sharp.

812
00:37:58,326 --> 00:37:59,583
Let the ladies do the drinking.

813
00:38:01,495 --> 00:38:05,413
You think if you get me laid,
I might make you chief.

814
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:09,331
<i>At some point,
we all have to choose.<i>

815
00:38:09,618 --> 00:38:11,830
<i>Do we fall back
on what we know ?<i>

816
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:19,120
I hear dr. Marlowe
is going home.

817
00:38:20,286 --> 00:38:21,120
About time.

818
00:38:21,385 --> 00:38:23,012
The fingernails,
the hand holding,

819
00:38:23,316 --> 00:38:24,342
well played.

820
00:38:24,686 --> 00:38:26,790
Now you can get back
to being Cristina.

821
00:38:29,397 --> 00:38:32,033
<i>Or do we step forward
to something new ?<i>

822
00:38:38,867 --> 00:38:41,153
<i>It's hard not to be
haunted by our past.<i>

823
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:05,223
<i>our history is what shapes us,
what guides us.<i>

824
00:39:10,685 --> 00:39:12,083
Seriously ?

825
00:39:12,607 --> 00:39:14,620
Okay.
That stops right now.

826
00:39:14,808 --> 00:39:17,982
It's just, I'm... I'm waiting
for Derek, and I'm very tired.

827
00:39:18,028 --> 00:39:18,642
I don't care.

828
00:39:19,038 --> 00:39:19,572
Let me in.

829
00:39:19,668 --> 00:39:22,011
- Excuse me ?
- It's freezing out here, and I have

830
00:39:22,107 --> 00:39:24,012
been working myself up
to saying this,

831
00:39:24,486 --> 00:39:27,333
well, for a while now, so I need you
to let me in now, please.

832
00:39:36,706 --> 00:39:39,031
It's my fault your father
didn't fight harder for you.

833
00:39:39,255 --> 00:39:40,493
I knew about you.

834
00:39:40,817 --> 00:39:43,812
I could've pushed him to be a part
of your life. I should've pushed him.

835
00:39:44,228 --> 00:39:45,322
You were a child.

836
00:39:45,695 --> 00:39:47,112
We were the adults.

837
00:39:48,365 --> 00:39:50,732
But we were just married,
and it was new and...

838
00:39:51,417 --> 00:39:52,600
that's what I cared about.

839
00:39:53,416 --> 00:39:56,193
And I know the groceries
and everything are a little much,

840
00:39:56,318 --> 00:39:57,401
but that's just what I do.

841
00:39:58,068 --> 00:39:59,912
I mean, quit looking at me
like I'm crazy

842
00:39:59,937 --> 00:40:02,021
'cause that's not fair.
I'm just trying to find a way

843
00:40:02,028 --> 00:40:04,301
to be there for you
the only way that I know how,

844
00:40:05,567 --> 00:40:07,503
and if you can't accept that, fine.

845
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:10,142
But just stop being so rude.

846
00:40:10,686 --> 00:40:11,242
And I...

847
00:40:13,805 --> 00:40:14,811
Okay.

848
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,682
I'm overstepping again, aren't I ?

849
00:40:18,485 --> 00:40:19,672
As mothers go,

850
00:40:20,545 --> 00:40:22,633
I've only ever known
overbearing,

851
00:40:23,026 --> 00:40:24,332
never overprotective.

852
00:40:24,887 --> 00:40:26,480
This is all new.

853
00:40:28,786 --> 00:40:29,463
It's okay.

854
00:40:29,878 --> 00:40:30,581
It is ?

855
00:40:30,817 --> 00:40:31,441
Yes.

856
00:40:31,807 --> 00:40:33,552
<i>Our history resurfaces<i>

857
00:40:33,758 --> 00:40:36,140
<i>time after time after time.<i>

858
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:37,840
Not just surgery,

859
00:40:38,255 --> 00:40:39,621
but chief of surgery.

860
00:40:40,245 --> 00:40:40,992
Really ?

861
00:40:41,266 --> 00:40:43,743
Oh, well, not for much longer, really.

862
00:40:45,177 --> 00:40:45,911
I'm gonna go...

863
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:49,282
over there.
Hold down the fort, chief.

864
00:40:54,227 --> 00:40:57,030
So, um, you come here often ?

865
00:40:57,386 --> 00:41:00,043
Sometimes. It's on my way
home from bio class.

866
00:41:02,265 --> 00:41:03,380
Excuse me.

867
00:41:04,376 --> 00:41:05,932
- Is this seat taken ?
- No.

868
00:41:07,455 --> 00:41:10,893
- It was, it was nice talking to you.
- You, too.

869
00:41:13,655 --> 00:41:16,031
the last time I tried
to pick up a woman,

870
00:41:16,047 --> 00:41:18,113
I had a harvey wallbanger
in one hand

871
00:41:18,148 --> 00:41:21,431
- and an afro pick in the other.
- Oh Richard

872
00:41:21,585 --> 00:41:22,702
Well, you think about it.

873
00:41:22,907 --> 00:41:26,351
I mean, when you're married,
you'd like to think you still have game.

874
00:41:27,955 --> 00:41:28,860
Practice on me.

875
00:41:29,745 --> 00:41:30,252
I'm sorry ?

876
00:41:31,005 --> 00:41:32,210
Mark's right. I mean,
