1
00:00:00,303 --> 00:00:01,957
Previously on "Grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,021 --> 00:00:03,493
You're watching me sleep again?

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,019
It's just that

4
00:00:04,077 --> 00:00:04,771
you snore a little.

5
00:00:05,044 --> 00:00:06,447
Harold O'Malley, 63,

6
00:00:06,498 --> 00:00:09,952
Scheduled for a transhiatal
esophagectomy tomorrow morning at 9:00.

7
00:00:09,986 --> 00:00:11,671
I want you to take the tumor out.

8
00:00:11,783 --> 00:00:14,853
As things progress with my dad, it would
help me if you were straight with me.

9
00:00:15,707 --> 00:00:16,160
Okay.

10
00:00:16,338 --> 00:00:18,110
So that's it?
We're closing him back up?

11
00:00:18,222 --> 00:00:18,578
No.

12
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:21,814
- But I thought...
- The patient asked us to proceed.

13
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:22,883
You want to watch the kidneys

14
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:25,863
because if the kidneys fail, that's a sign
that everything else is starting to go.

15
00:00:25,927 --> 00:00:28,623
130 ccs of shiny, yellow urine!

16
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:30,261
That is fantastic!

17
00:00:31,385 --> 00:00:34,331
Heather Douglas, 17, past medical
history of vater syndrome.

18
00:00:34,395 --> 00:00:36,822
I think I could significantly
help with the spinal curvature.

19
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:37,811
I get to scrub in.

20
00:00:37,847 --> 00:00:38,880
Not till I say so.

21
00:00:38,907 --> 00:00:40,353
I deposited the damn check.

22
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,732
Insurance bastards.

23
00:00:41,768 --> 00:00:43,313
The surgery's
too experimental.

24
00:00:43,345 --> 00:00:45,573
Looks like there won't be
a surgery to scrub in on.

25
00:00:45,636 --> 00:00:46,702
Sorry, Stevens.

26
00:00:46,725 --> 00:00:48,593
You don't get the high horse
this week, Addison.

27
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:49,793
Not this week.

28
00:00:49,818 --> 00:00:52,001
Dr. Burke's hand...
has he had any tremors?

29
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:54,010
- Talk to him.
- No. 'Cause then he wins.

30
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:55,260
My father's here.

31
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:56,960
The one I don't talk to
and barely know?

32
00:00:57,005 --> 00:00:57,853
He's here.

33
00:00:57,935 --> 00:00:59,980
If you want to go back to plastics...

34
00:01:00,225 --> 00:01:00,771
Nah.

35
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:04,563
All right!

36
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:15,641
Just shut it off, please!

37
00:01:16,098 --> 00:01:18,140
Could you not snap at me?

38
00:01:20,597 --> 00:01:21,750
I didn't sleep much.

39
00:01:21,797 --> 00:01:25,120
Maybe that's because you were too busy
shoving me every five minutes.

40
00:01:25,158 --> 00:01:26,130
I wasn't shoving you.

41
00:01:26,165 --> 00:01:30,091
I was nudging you to stop the very loud
sawing of wood

42
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:31,972
I wore the nose strip.

43
00:01:32,088 --> 00:01:34,382
Oh, it's cute, but it doesn't work.

44
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:35,042
Ow.

45
00:01:35,087 --> 00:01:37,603
- What?
- You need to shave.

46
00:01:50,136 --> 00:01:51,801
Izzie, uh...

47
00:01:52,356 --> 00:01:55,083
The--the--the--the...

48
00:01:55,476 --> 00:01:57,541
The check. The--it's not, uh,

49
00:01:57,648 --> 00:01:58,993
It's--it's not--

50
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,480
Did you--did you-- did you drop here?

51
00:02:01,196 --> 00:02:02,480
Here. Move, move, move. Did you--

52
00:02:02,807 --> 00:02:06,890
not--it--it's not here.
Izzie, it's not here.

53
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:09,593
I deposited it, okay?

54
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,580
You didn't deposit it in the garbage
disposal or something like that, did you?

55
00:02:13,606 --> 00:02:14,200
It's at the bank,

56
00:02:14,545 --> 00:02:15,130
okay, George?

57
00:02:15,145 --> 00:02:16,663
Now just shut up about it already.

58
00:02:18,927 --> 00:02:20,563
It's at--it's at the bank?
It's--

59
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:22,441
- It's earning interest?

60
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:24,130
Did I not just say,
"shut up about it already"?

61
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:24,870
Izzie...

62
00:02:26,536 --> 00:02:27,543
It's real now.

63
00:02:28,177 --> 00:02:29,800
That money, it could--

64
00:02:30,077 --> 00:02:31,240
The money could travel.

65
00:02:31,336 --> 00:02:32,700
It could--it could buy things.

66
00:02:32,747 --> 00:02:34,563
It could buy many, many things.
That's a--

67
00:02:35,578 --> 00:02:38,231
- That's a lot of money, Izzie.
- Shut up about it, George.

68
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,142
I'm just saying--

69
00:02:39,685 --> 00:02:40,833
I'm just saying,

70
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:42,593
life is short.

71
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:44,760
You know, it's like,

72
00:02:44,907 --> 00:02:47,763
cancer happens and surgery happens,
and I--

73
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:52,631
You know, it's just... it's just...
"gather ye rosebuds"...

74
00:02:52,698 --> 00:02:56,243
You know, you have
8.7 million rosebuds, Izzie.

75
00:02:56,396 --> 00:02:58,092
You gotta spend some rosebuds.

76
00:02:58,356 --> 00:02:59,670
That's what I'm saying.

77
00:03:04,746 --> 00:03:06,153
You made me burn my french toast.

78
00:03:06,198 --> 00:03:08,182
You can buy new french toast.

79
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:30,640
Oh.

80
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:33,250
Hey. Uh, I was, uh--

81
00:03:33,278 --> 00:03:34,962
yeah, I was just, uh,

82
00:03:34,986 --> 00:03:35,751
-  Just...
- The baby's doing...

83
00:03:36,165 --> 00:03:37,580
Good. Yeah, she's good.

84
00:03:37,645 --> 00:03:39,821
- Good. That's... That's good.
- Yeah.

85
00:03:40,118 --> 00:03:41,170
- Doctors.
- Yes.
- What?

86
00:03:41,198 --> 00:03:43,863
I was wondering, the baby looks...

87
00:03:44,828 --> 00:03:45,473
Good.

88
00:03:45,535 --> 00:03:47,171
- Yeah, she's good.
- She looks good.

89
00:03:47,288 --> 00:03:50,733
- She is. She's, uh...
- She's good? She's out of the woods?

90
00:03:50,788 --> 00:03:53,661
- She is. She's, uh...
- She's good.

91
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:57,591
She is out of the woods. Her vitals are
strong. She made it through the night,

92
00:03:57,626 --> 00:03:58,990
and she's, uh...

93
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:01,800
She's a fighter.

94
00:04:02,805 --> 00:04:04,630
So I can tell my wife and my daughter?

95
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:06,213
You can.

96
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:07,472
And you should.

97
00:04:07,628 --> 00:04:08,590
Oh, thank you.

98
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,062
Thank you both so much.

99
00:04:24,936 --> 00:04:29,010
Yeah. No, she's out of the woods.

100
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:33,311
How am I related to that man?

101
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:34,643
What do you mean?

102
00:04:35,585 --> 00:04:37,443
Look at him. He's a mess.

103
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:38,802
Yeah?

104
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:41,090
I mean, he's a disaster...

105
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:44,401
He's a stammering, mumbling,
clumsy disaster

106
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:46,902
with whom I have absolutely
nothing in common,

107
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:48,912
Not one thing.

108
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:53,581
I hate to break this to you...

109
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:55,893
What?

110
00:04:55,936 --> 00:04:59,480
Well, you know, you do your own
share of stammering yourself.

111
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:02,173
Yeah, that nervous talking thing you do?
It's actually a lot like him.

112
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:02,732
mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

113
00:05:02,746 --> 00:05:04,220
yeah, that's why I'm so happy.

114
00:05:04,236 --> 00:05:05,862
- No, it's not.
- Plus that messy thing.

115
00:05:05,896 --> 00:05:06,871
Oh, totally.

116
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:08,711
You're the messy one.

117
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:09,200
No,

118
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:11,831
my apartment's messy, my locker's messy, 

119
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:14,002
but I am not messy.

120
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:17,520
Sometimes you have, like,
food and stuff in your hair.

121
00:05:17,565 --> 00:05:18,221
Yeah, food.

122
00:05:19,097 --> 00:05:20,391
Band-aids on your face.

123
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:23,242
I can still kinda see that indentation from
the nose strip you were wearing last night.

124
00:05:24,987 --> 00:05:28,593
You... are in a relationship
with no words.

125
00:05:28,656 --> 00:05:31,773
And you are a millionaire in $20 shoes.
Whatever.

126
00:05:34,557 --> 00:05:35,573
Oh, my god...

127
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,433
She's just like him. Right?

128
00:05:43,457 --> 00:05:44,453
Dr.  Bailey, you paged me?

129
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:45,261
Yes, I did.

130
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,681
We're going to proceed with
Heather's surgery, as scheduled.

131
00:05:49,606 --> 00:05:51,292
The insurance company
changed their mind?

132
00:05:51,325 --> 00:05:52,252
No. Better.

133
00:05:52,507 --> 00:05:56,553
It seems an anonymous donor has
offered to foot Heather's entire bill.

134
00:05:56,726 --> 00:05:57,702
Wow.

135
00:05:58,555 --> 00:06:00,841
That is incredible.
You're a very lucky girl.

136
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:05,930
Hey, that's the first time anyone's ever
said that sentence to me in my entire life.

137
00:06:06,098 --> 00:06:06,952
I like it.

138
00:06:21,435 --> 00:06:24,682
You spent 300 grand so you could
scrub in on this surgery?

139
00:06:25,355 --> 00:06:27,031
- No.
- No?

140
00:06:29,618 --> 00:06:31,040
I... I spent the 3...

141
00:06:31,578 --> 00:06:32,753
Have you seen that girl?

142
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:35,530
Her life is miserable.
She's desperate.

143
00:06:35,706 --> 00:06:37,520
She... She'll never have a date,

144
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:40,108
She'll never wear high heels,
she'll never feel normal.

145
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:42,284
I... I spent 300 grand because it--

146
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,263
It's a good thing.

147
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,200
I was hoping you would tell me you spent
the money so you could scrub in.

148
00:06:55,106 --> 00:06:55,753
But I...

149
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:58,810
You need to decide whether
or not you're a surgeon.

150
00:06:59,076 --> 00:07:01,092
Because this thing you did...

151
00:07:01,928 --> 00:07:06,840
this is lovely and generous, and I'm not
trying to take away from any of that, but

152
00:07:07,977 --> 00:07:10,491
You are, once again, overly involved.

153
00:07:10,577 --> 00:07:13,482
Once again, you are personally involved,
so...

154
00:07:15,036 --> 00:07:18,181
no, I'm sorry. You cannot scrub in.

155
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,682
George kissed me.
Yesterday.

156
00:07:45,326 --> 00:07:47,661
One minute he's holding a urine bag,
the next minute, he's kissing me.

157
00:07:51,915 --> 00:07:53,761
You think he's just freaking
out about his dad?

158
00:07:54,787 --> 00:07:57,411
Yeah, you're right, you're right.
He's probably just freaking out.

159
00:07:57,447 --> 00:07:58,453
I shouldn't hold him to it.

160
00:07:59,628 --> 00:08:00,862
- Oh, man.
- What?

161
00:08:04,888 --> 00:08:06,081
Did you not just hear a word I said?

162
00:08:06,108 --> 00:08:07,300
I'm pouring my heart out here.

163
00:08:07,997 --> 00:08:09,293
Jeez.

164
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:12,791
It's all about you, isn't it? It's all
about a... Everything's about Addison.

165
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:14,822
I aborted Mark's baby.

166
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:18,231
It is all about you.

167
00:08:20,288 --> 00:08:22,102
Floor is all yours.

168
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,300
About eight months ago.

169
00:08:28,305 --> 00:08:32,890
I...peed on a stick,

170
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:38,291
and I wasn't even, uh...
gonna tell him, but then I did...

171
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:41,333
tell him. And, uh,

172
00:08:41,607 --> 00:08:43,721
he went out and he bought this...

173
00:08:44,628 --> 00:08:47,812
insane yankees onesie

174
00:08:48,566 --> 00:08:52,000
and a calendar
and marked the due date,

175
00:08:52,807 --> 00:08:55,471
which, I should mention, was today.

176
00:08:56,878 --> 00:09:00,320
- You didn't want a baby?
- I wanted Derek.

177
00:09:01,315 --> 00:09:03,982
I wanted to have a baby with Derek.

178
00:09:05,696 --> 00:09:07,792
I never thought I'd end up alone.

179
00:09:08,178 --> 00:09:11,013
Hey, you have not "ended up" anywhere.

180
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:16,400
Yeah, you're right, I know.
It's just that, um...

181
00:09:17,468 --> 00:09:19,571
Sometimes it feels that way, you know?

182
00:09:20,496 --> 00:09:23,320
This is one of those weeks
it feels that way.

183
00:09:32,768 --> 00:09:34,183
Drill.

184
00:09:34,797 --> 00:09:36,352
Another screw, please.

185
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,782
Hey, how's your old man?

186
00:09:39,898 --> 00:09:43,010
His  urine output's holding steady.
Mostly it's steady today,

187
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:45,441
- which is good.
- Have you seen burke today?

188
00:09:46,665 --> 00:09:48,782
Even if I did like you,
I still wouldn't tell you that.

189
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:53,593
How can you be okay
with Burke but not Cristina?

190
00:09:53,808 --> 00:09:55,693
Her career wasn't on the line
when she lied to me.

191
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:58,721
Why don't you just ask Burke
about the hand yourself?

192
00:09:58,757 --> 00:10:00,742
I am not talking to him.
He owes me.

193
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:02,360
What?

194
00:10:02,676 --> 00:10:03,781
Oh, I don't know.

195
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,601
So you're together, but you
don't talk to each other?

196
00:10:06,496 --> 00:10:08,282
I wish I could find that in a woman.

197
00:10:08,835 --> 00:10:10,383
Hey, how's it going with Addison?

198
00:10:10,457 --> 00:10:12,000
What?
What?

199
00:10:12,206 --> 00:10:16,593
Why... why why would you... what... What
what do you... What do you mean by that?

200
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:18,873
Laura Grey, tiny baby.

201
00:10:19,568 --> 00:10:23,020
Laura. The baby. Right.
She's, uh, she's, um, doing fine.

202
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:24,142
She's doing well.

203
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:27,310
I gotta get out of gynie, though.
I gotta get back to sloan.

204
00:10:30,536 --> 00:10:32,732
What are you plotting,
and can I get in on it?

205
00:10:32,818 --> 00:10:33,481
Shut up. 

206
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:34,553
Oh.

207
00:10:38,415 --> 00:10:41,270
Ah! This is my surgery.
I should be down there.

208
00:10:45,025 --> 00:10:45,541
No.

209
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,111
Excuse me.

210
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:51,983
Mr. O'malley.

211
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:52,601
9-1-1?

212
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:53,581
Yeah.

213
00:10:57,227 --> 00:11:00,303
- Sucks.
- Yeah.

214
00:11:00,896 --> 00:11:01,781
Give  me the retractor.

215
00:11:02,115 --> 00:11:04,691
Um, dr. Shepherd, can you proceed
without me?

216
00:11:04,927 --> 00:11:05,712
Are you kidding me?

217
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:07,543
This is your surgery, Torres,

218
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:08,793
this is your find,

219
00:11:09,508 --> 00:11:10,003
and you want to leave?

220
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:11,192
I, um, I don't,

221
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:14,202
but, uh, yes, I'm sorry.
But if it's all right, I need to leave.

222
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:20,312
Give me some sponges,

223
00:11:22,957 --> 00:11:27,133
Okay, I called the family in
because I need to perform a procedure,

224
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:29,402
uh, on your father to help him breathe.

225
00:11:30,438 --> 00:11:32,672
So--so you're saying he can't breathe?

226
00:11:33,668 --> 00:11:36,051
With the extensive surgery,

227
00:11:36,267 --> 00:11:39,720
uh, your father is not
breathing on his own,

228
00:11:39,747 --> 00:11:41,573
which is why we still
have him intubated.

229
00:11:41,886 --> 00:11:42,560
Intubated?

230
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:44,902
The tube in dad's mouth.
It's breathing for him.

231
00:11:45,085 --> 00:11:49,301
And right now that tube has a kink in
it, which is straining his breathing.

232
00:11:49,878 --> 00:11:53,361
- How did it get a kink in it?
-

233
00:11:49,878 --> 00:11:53,363
It just happens.
We don't always know why.

234
00:11:49,878 --> 00:11:53,360
- How did it get a kink in it?
- It just happens we don't always know why.

235
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:55,252
But... But he's doing good today.

236
00:11:55,947 --> 00:11:57,980
I mean, he made...He made plenty of pee,

237
00:11:58,265 --> 00:12:00,460
still,  we need to replace the tube.

238
00:12:00,718 --> 00:12:03,240
So why don't you just do it?
I mean, what are we waiting for?

239
00:12:03,718 --> 00:12:04,213
okay,

240
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:07,291
with the damage
to your father's esophagus

241
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:10,300
and the swelling in his throat
from being intubated all this time...

242
00:12:10,517 --> 00:12:11,710
you might not be able to get it in,

243
00:12:13,045 --> 00:12:13,852
the new tube?

244
00:12:16,787 --> 00:12:18,491
Under these circumstances...

245
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:21,622
it can be a complicated procedure.

246
00:12:21,717 --> 00:12:23,751
If I'm not successful...

247
00:12:25,096 --> 00:12:30,363
I'm saying, uh,
you need to prepare yourselves.

248
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:53,623
What is that?

249
00:12:53,817 --> 00:12:54,683
It's Jerry.

250
00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:56,152
I'm sorry. I'm nervous.

251
00:12:56,346 --> 00:12:56,862
Oh.

252
00:12:57,675 --> 00:12:59,543
- Oh, god.
- Oh!
- Oh, my god.

253
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:02,662
- God, stop it, Jerry!
- I'm nervous!

254
00:13:04,336 --> 00:13:09,132
Oh! For god's sake, take some
charcoal or something, son.

255
00:13:11,187 --> 00:13:12,303
That's disgusting.

256
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:17,720
- Tyler.
- Yeah.

257
00:13:18,745 --> 00:13:21,211
Could you let dr. Burke know that

258
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,983
Mr. O'malley is having some kind of medical crisis right now

259
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:27,331
and I thought he would like to know.

260
00:13:28,145 --> 00:13:30,231
He's awake, you know?

261
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:33,070
Yeah, I know.

262
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:38,973
You want to handle this, chief?

263
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:42,502
Dr. Bailey, you have a lot more hands-on
hours these days than I do.

264
00:13:42,718 --> 00:13:44,933
I'll be standing by to help,
but this is all yours.

265
00:13:45,336 --> 00:13:49,670
- Grey, let me have an 8.0 E.T. tube.
- Dr. Bailey...

266
00:13:50,115 --> 00:13:52,360
This is a patient,
like any other patient.

267
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:54,442
There's no room for error,

268
00:13:54,845 --> 00:13:56,581
which means there's no room for nerves,

269
00:13:56,848 --> 00:13:58,031
so shake it off.

270
00:14:02,355 --> 00:14:04,143
All right, let's do this.

271
00:14:09,138 --> 00:14:10,661
Great. 8.0.

272
00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:15,372
- I can't, uh...
- Is it too tight?

273
00:14:15,498 --> 00:14:18,142
I can't get past the vocal chords.
Damn it.

274
00:14:18,377 --> 00:14:19,802
Pulse ox down 88.

275
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:22,583
- Damn it.
- 86. Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go

276
00:14:23,358 --> 00:14:24,403
Let me have a 7 1/2.

277
00:14:26,376 --> 00:14:27,123
Hurry.

278
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:30,670
Good.

279
00:14:34,146 --> 00:14:35,912
- Let me get a...
- Okay, I got it.

280
00:14:41,827 --> 00:14:43,393
Beautil job. Beautiful job.

281
00:14:43,445 --> 00:14:44,943
Oh, can I go tell George?

282
00:14:51,088 --> 00:14:53,011
Dr. Bailey, you all right?

283
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:58,781
My son... is named after his son.
I just need a minute.

284
00:15:05,527 --> 00:15:06,863
There's a surgery, you know?

285
00:15:07,037 --> 00:15:08,300
It's a minor laser thing.

286
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:09,943
Supposed to really help.
We could look into it.

287
00:15:11,516 --> 00:15:12,881
Sure, and while we're at it,

288
00:15:13,026 --> 00:15:15,123
let's look at halitosis cures for you.

289
00:15:15,426 --> 00:15:17,222
Not to mention stubble cures,

290
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:18,693
because it's now become

291
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:21,051
physically impossible
for me to kiss your face.

292
00:15:21,245 --> 00:15:24,081
I am too tired to shave!

293
00:15:26,446 --> 00:15:27,173
Sloan!

294
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:28,643
Dr. Sloan.

295
00:15:28,815 --> 00:15:30,003
Bone dry cappuccino.

296
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:31,941
And I watched 'em make it this time
so no mistakes.

297
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:35,991
Hey, I noticed you had a reconstructive
rhinoplasty on the board today, and I'd

298
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:38,143
I'd really like
to scrub in if at all possible.

299
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:43,042
You been working with Addison this week?

300
00:15:44,105 --> 00:15:47,603
Yes, sir, working.
Working... a lot.

301
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,012
Working hard.
Just...

302
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:50,850
Working.

303
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,741
Is she miserable?

304
00:15:55,728 --> 00:15:56,390
I'm sorry?

305
00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:57,491
It's just...

306
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:06,013
I need to know if she's... at least
miserable this week. Did she seem...

307
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:08,973
Is she miserable?

308
00:16:09,645 --> 00:16:11,570
Oh, dude, she's awful.

309
00:16:12,165 --> 00:16:13,700
She's torturing me.

310
00:16:13,778 --> 00:16:15,260
I seriously have to get
away from that woman.

311
00:16:15,328 --> 00:16:18,070
I mean, she is completely
and utterly, 100% miserable.

312
00:16:20,117 --> 00:16:21,333
Good.

313
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,181
- So can I scrub in?
- No.

314
00:16:30,826 --> 00:16:32,052
Are you sleeping?

315
00:16:32,437 --> 00:16:34,761
I should be. I haven't slept in days.

316
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:36,530
Me neither.

317
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:43,882
I can't sleep alone anymore. I used
to sleep just fine, and then he...

318
00:16:46,156 --> 00:16:49,542
God, he gets me all strung out on him,
and then he disappears?

319
00:16:50,696 --> 00:16:52,841
He didn't disappear.
He's in the hospital.

320
00:16:54,455 --> 00:16:56,083
I just want to know how he's doing.

321
00:16:56,397 --> 00:16:57,802
You could just ask him.

322
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,161
Uh, he could just tell me.

323
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:08,473
George's dad is going into
renal failure.

324
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:10,183
I heard.

325
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:12,970
My dad's here,

326
00:17:13,316 --> 00:17:17,531
everywhere, every day. He's perfectly
healthy, and I have nothing to say to him.

327
00:17:19,098 --> 00:17:20,891
If George's dad dies...

328
00:17:21,455 --> 00:17:22,190
I know.

329
00:17:23,368 --> 00:17:26,271
If Thatcher died, my life
wouldn't be any different.

330
00:17:29,218 --> 00:17:31,492
Is it weird that I'm
a little jealous of George?

331
00:17:34,756 --> 00:17:36,941
Yes.

332
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:43,572
Bailey re-intubated him, but, um...

333
00:17:44,265 --> 00:17:48,442
He was without oxygen for,
I don't know, a few minutes.

334
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:49,202
O'Malley...

335
00:17:51,756 --> 00:17:52,752
there's no blame here.

336
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:58,960
Your father's body is diseased
and has undergone tremendous trauma.

337
00:17:59,928 --> 00:18:01,720
Now his organs are shutting down.

338
00:18:04,976 --> 00:18:06,172
There's no blame here.

339
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,151
Do people come back from this?

340
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:13,800
His B.U.N. and creatinine are high.
I get that.

341
00:18:15,997 --> 00:18:18,380
I was just wondering,
in--in your experience,

342
00:18:19,137 --> 00:18:20,580
can people come back from this?

343
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:30,180
I don't have any statistics.
I don't have any more medicine for you.

344
00:18:32,037 --> 00:18:33,582
Now it's about faith.

345
00:18:35,918 --> 00:18:37,141
We're men of science.

346
00:18:39,148 --> 00:18:42,362
In my experience, science is not enough,
O'Malley.

347
00:18:44,065 --> 00:18:45,281
But if you want me

348
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:47,022
to hope with you...

349
00:18:49,105 --> 00:18:50,931
if you'd like me to send up a prayer,

350
00:18:51,126 --> 00:18:53,361
that is a thing I'd be happy to do.

351
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:07,412
You have family here?

352
00:19:09,018 --> 00:19:10,332
Yeah, a daughter.

353
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:12,431
She's 17.

354
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:14,142
Oh, I'm so sorry.

355
00:19:15,296 --> 00:19:15,993
Yeah. 

356
00:19:16,707 --> 00:19:18,422
She had surgery on her spine.

357
00:19:19,086 --> 00:19:20,802
And they said it went well.

358
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:24,213
But then she has trouble
with her kidneys and...

359
00:19:25,627 --> 00:19:27,993
well, she hasn't woken up.

360
00:19:29,227 --> 00:19:30,772
My husband either.

361
00:19:31,848 --> 00:19:33,891
It was a dangerous surgery.

362
00:19:34,597 --> 00:19:35,813
They told us that.

363
00:19:36,277 --> 00:19:37,531
My  husband's, too.

364
00:19:39,548 --> 00:19:41,932
He has... cancer, so...

365
00:19:42,768 --> 00:19:44,520
I was surprised when they
went through with it.

366
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:47,723
I thought I'd be taking him home.

367
00:19:53,368 --> 00:19:55,831
Excuse me, mrs. Douglas.

368
00:19:57,606 --> 00:19:58,951
Heather is asking for you.

369
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:00,953
She woke up?

370
00:20:01,255 --> 00:20:02,022
She did.

371
00:20:02,596 --> 00:20:03,490
And she looks great.

372
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,701
Congratulations.

373
00:20:06,128 --> 00:20:06,830
That's wonderful.

374
00:20:07,215 --> 00:20:08,283
Good luck.

375
00:20:08,497 --> 00:20:09,253
I'll...

376
00:20:10,615 --> 00:20:12,122
Good luck.

377
00:20:12,318 --> 00:20:13,132
Thanks.

378
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:23,022
Why did you do it?

379
00:20:24,218 --> 00:20:25,072
Dr. O'Malley.

380
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:27,720
Why did you do the surgery once
you saw the cancer had spread?

381
00:20:28,516 --> 00:20:29,653
George...

382
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,770
He asked you, right?

383
00:20:35,096 --> 00:20:36,701
He asked you to do it no matter what?

384
00:20:37,807 --> 00:20:39,763
We have to honor our patient's wishes.

385
00:20:45,317 --> 00:20:47,253
You said you would be straight with me.

386
00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:54,482
He... he could've lived for weeks...
or... or months.

387
00:20:56,195 --> 00:20:57,580
We could've had months with him.

388
00:20:58,877 --> 00:20:59,751
My mom...

389
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,451
she could've had months with him!

390
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:03,031
he wanted to fight the cancer, George.

391
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:05,270
- It was his choice.
- He didn't know any better!

392
00:21:07,997 --> 00:21:09,592
You knew better!

393
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,110
You shouldn't have done it.

394
00:21:18,147 --> 00:21:21,002
You shouldn't have done it!

395
00:21:36,098 --> 00:21:38,193
Oh, my God. Look at you.

396
00:21:38,837 --> 00:21:39,973
I'm miserable.

397
00:21:40,476 --> 00:21:41,880
It's the rain...

398
00:21:42,755 --> 00:21:44,630
the constant dampness in the air.

399
00:21:45,646 --> 00:21:47,763
It takes the body a while to adjust.

400
00:21:47,936 --> 00:21:49,423
I don't want to adjust.

401
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,263
Then go home.

402
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:55,153
If you'd had the baby,

403
00:21:56,366 --> 00:21:59,230
we'd be together in New York right now.
It wouldn't be raining,

404
00:21:59,757 --> 00:22:02,613
and even if it was, we wouldn't care
because we'd be together.

405
00:22:02,728 --> 00:22:04,310
We'd be together,

406
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:08,552
and I'd have a family instead of walking
pneumonia and an ex-best friend who hates me.

407
00:22:08,635 --> 00:22:10,961
You didn't want to raise a child, Mark.

408
00:22:11,007 --> 00:22:12,410
You wanted to trump Derek.

409
00:22:12,688 --> 00:22:13,821
You wanted to win.

410
00:22:13,846 --> 00:22:15,120
Don't make this my fault.

411
00:22:15,436 --> 00:22:16,293
You didn't want a baby.

412
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,330
No, i did

413
00:22:17,685 --> 00:22:19,930
want a baby, Mark.

414
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:24,962
That last woman you slept with
before I left New-York Charlene

415
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,290
the peds nurse?

416
00:22:26,947 --> 00:22:30,270
Did you think that she was
the only one I knew about?

417
00:22:30,805 --> 00:22:32,960
You're rewriting history, Mark.

418
00:22:33,257 --> 00:22:37,061
We wouldn't still be together.
We weren't a great couple.

419
00:22:37,116 --> 00:22:38,410
And you would've made...

420
00:22:39,437 --> 00:22:42,161
a terrible father, Mark.

421
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,051
I did want a baby.
I did. I just...

422
00:22:48,068 --> 00:22:49,943
I just didn't want one with you.

423
00:23:26,658 --> 00:23:27,651
What?

424
00:23:28,127 --> 00:23:30,721
- Is that his lunch?
I've been looking everywhere for that.
- Oh, no. He can't have that.

425
00:23:31,235 --> 00:23:33,350
- What?
- He's, uh, restricted from food.

426
00:23:33,468 --> 00:23:34,583
- No, he's not.
- No, I'm his doctor.

427
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:37,512
- You are not.
- I just want to know how he is.

428
00:23:37,586 --> 00:23:39,740
And with holding food gets her that how?

429
00:23:41,947 --> 00:23:42,792
Fine.

430
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:44,993
Feed him. Whatever.

431
00:23:47,275 --> 00:23:48,902
You want me to call security?

432
00:24:05,968 --> 00:24:06,753
Hey.

433
00:24:07,468 --> 00:24:08,213
Hey.

434
00:24:09,547 --> 00:24:11,460
Haven't seen you
the last couple of days.

435
00:24:12,407 --> 00:24:13,600
Yeah, I was covering the pit,

436
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:16,120
and, uh, I got pulled into
an emergency appy

437
00:24:16,168 --> 00:24:18,593
and a ruptured spleen.

438
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:20,232
It's been pretty chaotic.

439
00:24:21,568 --> 00:24:24,750
Look, Karev, I'm your attending.

440
00:24:25,148 --> 00:24:26,310
I'm sorry about what happened.

441
00:24:26,777 --> 00:24:27,831
It's been a...

442
00:24:28,988 --> 00:24:31,330
a weird week for me.

443
00:24:32,595 --> 00:24:34,872
so I normally...

444
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,222
anyway, I apologize.

445
00:24:39,865 --> 00:24:43,053
The baby's, uh, bowels functioning yet?

446
00:24:43,505 --> 00:24:47,613
Uh, yeah, actually, um...
she had her first dipper change today

447
00:24:48,545 --> 00:24:49,220
That's good.

448
00:24:50,508 --> 00:24:52,270
Yeah, it is.

449
00:25:15,518 --> 00:25:18,743
That neighbor kid,
Mike Wilden?

450
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:22,843
I did hit him in the face with a stick.

451
00:25:25,256 --> 00:25:29,243
And... when his dad came over
and he was yelling and...

452
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:32,471
and... and you asked me if it was true.

453
00:25:35,547 --> 00:25:37,522
I lied.

454
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:41,841
And you thought I never lied

455
00:25:43,155 --> 00:25:44,653
so you took my side.

456
00:25:45,828 --> 00:25:48,451
And you and his dad
got in that big fight,

457
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:51,873
and then his kids egged our house

458
00:25:53,158 --> 00:25:54,713
and then Ronnie and Jerry
went over and...

459
00:25:55,748 --> 00:25:58,633
blew up his lawn mower.
Anyway...

460
00:26:00,437 --> 00:26:01,542
I did it.

461
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:08,471
He was teasing me...
and he was bigger than me...

462
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:13,163
so I needed the stick to reach his face.

463
00:26:17,287 --> 00:26:18,792
And I lied to you, dad.

464
00:26:24,565 --> 00:26:25,782
So...

465
00:26:28,655 --> 00:26:30,093
I'm saying I'm sorry.

466
00:26:34,536 --> 00:26:36,060
Dad...

467
00:26:41,238 --> 00:26:42,993
if you have any more fight in you...

468
00:26:45,797 --> 00:26:48,240
if you could fight thithing just...

469
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:51,371
just a little harder,
that would be good.

470
00:26:54,895 --> 00:26:56,773
That'd be good right now.

471
00:27:09,777 --> 00:27:11,011
Where's derek?

472
00:27:11,845 --> 00:27:13,210
He slept at his place.

473
00:27:11,846 --> 00:27:13,212
He slept at his place.

474
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,111
Do I really snore?

475
00:27:17,868 --> 00:27:21,433
Well, I grew up next to a freeway,
so it doesn't really bother me,
but, yeah, you do.

476
00:27:23,835 --> 00:27:25,710
Did you get any sleep last night?

477
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:26,522
No.

478
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,272
No, I stayed up baking

479
00:27:30,428 --> 00:27:33,272
and cleaning the bathroom floor
in case George wants to lay down on it.

480
00:27:36,745 --> 00:27:38,540
It's weird.
I have all this money.

481
00:27:40,286 --> 00:27:41,350
I... I have all this money,

482
00:27:41,497 --> 00:27:45,243
and I would spend every penny of it
to save George from what he's
about to go through, but

483
00:27:46,256 --> 00:27:46,882
I... can't.

484
00:27:48,305 --> 00:27:49,523
It's useless.

485
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:52,100
So I made cobbler.

486
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:55,900
Well, cobbler's good.

487
00:27:56,518 --> 00:27:57,231
Yeah.

488
00:28:18,215 --> 00:28:20,031
She told you.

489
00:28:20,648 --> 00:28:21,860
Uh...

490
00:28:22,396 --> 00:28:24,143
yeah.

491
00:28:29,728 --> 00:28:31,690
U think I'd be a terrible father?

492
00:28:31,935 --> 00:28:32,643
Oh, I don't--

493
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,262
I don't... Are you...

494
00:28:35,576 --> 00:28:37,791
Okay, do you like kids?

495
00:28:38,587 --> 00:28:39,511
I don't know.

496
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:41,960
Depends on how loud they are.

497
00:28:43,397 --> 00:28:46,980
Okay. Do you like your family?
I mean, are you a family kind of guy?

498
00:28:48,216 --> 00:28:49,751
I don't really have a family.

499
00:28:50,266 --> 00:28:50,852
Derek...

500
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:53,190
was my family.

501
00:28:53,627 --> 00:28:54,480
Okay.

502
00:28:55,428 --> 00:28:57,881
Well, what about, uh,
birthdays and anniversaries?

503
00:28:58,198 --> 00:28:59,370
Do you remember those sorts of things?

504
00:28:59,747 --> 00:29:00,353
No.

505
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:01,991
I don't know.

506
00:29:03,437 --> 00:29:04,392
Sometimes.

507
00:29:06,268 --> 00:29:08,031
Isn't it the same with... with all men?

508
00:29:08,227 --> 00:29:08,892
No.

509
00:29:09,637 --> 00:29:11,763
Some men just like kids. To, uh,

510
00:29:12,686 --> 00:29:14,663
To some men, family is everything.

511
00:29:15,737 --> 00:29:17,132
Right.

512
00:29:18,116 --> 00:29:19,321
And you know these men?

513
00:29:19,707 --> 00:29:20,293
I do.

514
00:29:21,407 --> 00:29:22,873
I know one.

515
00:29:31,707 --> 00:29:34,973
I would' made a terrible father.

516
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:46,063
You're saying...
You're saying it's not getting better.

517
00:29:46,388 --> 00:29:48,681
You're saying he's not gonna wake up.

518
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,382
Mrs. O'Malley...

519
00:29:51,828 --> 00:29:53,643
All of his organs are shutting down.

520
00:29:55,057 --> 00:29:58,110
His liver and his kidneys
are no longer supporting him,

521
00:29:59,318 --> 00:30:02,481
and he is entirely dependant
upon his life support machines.

522
00:30:02,965 --> 00:30:05,171
We're saying he's not going to wake up.

523
00:30:06,697 --> 00:30:09,471
You can keep him on life support

524
00:30:09,746 --> 00:30:12,102
and wait for nature to take its course.

525
00:30:12,546 --> 00:30:15,730
That could take days or weeks.

526
00:30:16,778 --> 00:30:17,912
Or you can...

527
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:21,912
take him off life support.

528
00:30:22,856 --> 00:30:23,850
Unplug him?

529
00:30:24,508 --> 00:30:25,382
Yes, ma'am.

530
00:30:29,478 --> 00:30:30,330
Georgie.

531
00:30:31,935 --> 00:30:32,790
Yeah?

532
00:30:34,308 --> 00:30:35,341
What do you think?

533
00:30:40,928 --> 00:30:42,421
Dad's in pain.

534
00:30:43,777 --> 00:30:47,131
His organs are shutting down.
He can't breathe on his own.

535
00:30:47,697 --> 00:30:49,143
It's painful.

536
00:30:51,356 --> 00:30:53,573
And he's on medication, but...

537
00:30:55,265 --> 00:30:58,063
medication can only do so much.

538
00:30:59,465 --> 00:31:00,853
You think...

539
00:31:02,815 --> 00:31:05,222
you're saying you think it's time...

540
00:31:07,637 --> 00:31:09,603
to let him go?

541
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:24,620
We can't tell you
what to do here, George.

542
00:31:36,388 --> 00:31:38,370
He's not dad like this.

543
00:31:43,158 --> 00:31:45,123
And he's not
gonna wake up, mom.

544
00:32:22,635 --> 00:32:26,322
Is there a drawer
of unopened cards somewhere?

545
00:32:26,796 --> 00:32:27,963
I'm sorry, what?

546
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:31,342
I just...

547
00:32:31,818 --> 00:32:37,001
wanted to know. 
I've only ever heard my mother's version
of the story of why you left.

548
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:42,020
And I was just wondering if maybe
you have a side that I haven't heard.

549
00:32:47,577 --> 00:32:50,782
Your mother moved to boston, and, u..

550
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:54,112
I wanted to...

551
00:32:54,988 --> 00:32:56,671
but she told me not...

552
00:32:57,676 --> 00:33:00,293
to call or come around, and, uh...

553
00:33:01,285 --> 00:33:03,682
She... She was, uh, um...

554
00:33:08,878 --> 00:33:10,683
Eventually, I remarried.

555
00:33:11,738 --> 00:33:12,660
And I...

556
00:33:19,425 --> 00:33:21,522
I'm s... I'm sorry.

557
00:33:22,698 --> 00:33:23,620
Do you snore?

558
00:33:24,265 --> 00:33:24,671
What?

559
00:33:25,788 --> 00:33:28,411
It appears that I snore.

560
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:31,152
My mother never did, so I was just...

561
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:33,132
Forget it.

562
00:33:34,557 --> 00:33:35,190
I snore.

563
00:33:37,547 --> 00:33:38,823
I snore like a trucker.

564
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:43,240
You get that from me.

565
00:33:45,867 --> 00:33:48,601
The wax earplugs work pretty good.

566
00:33:53,905 --> 00:33:55,883
Thanks.

567
00:34:11,056 --> 00:34:12,280
hey.

568
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:15,601
Derek.

569
00:34:16,935 --> 00:34:19,341
I was waiting on an update
on mr. O'Malley.

570
00:34:20,295 --> 00:34:21,902
I didn't want to intrude, but, uh...

571
00:34:23,256 --> 00:34:24,190
do you have an update?

572
00:34:25,578 --> 00:34:26,462
They're letting him go.

573
00:34:40,988 --> 00:34:42,492
Haven't had any more tremors.

574
00:34:44,885 --> 00:34:46,313
Not one all week.

575
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:49,683
How about that?

576
00:34:50,818 --> 00:34:51,832
Yeah.

577
00:34:53,205 --> 00:34:54,401
How about that?

578
00:38:03,145 --> 00:38:04,251
I'm both.

579
00:38:05,746 --> 00:38:06,210
What?

580
00:38:07,365 --> 00:38:07,950
I'm both.

581
00:38:10,025 --> 00:38:11,343
I'm a surgeon,

582
00:38:11,947 --> 00:38:14,382
and I am a person who becomes
emotionally involved.

583
00:38:15,857 --> 00:38:18,861
And I will never again
cross a line like I did with Denny.

584
00:38:19,987 --> 00:38:21,191
I have learned my lesson.

585
00:38:22,618 --> 00:38:23,551
But I'm still both.

586
00:38:25,298 --> 00:38:27,280
And I'm not gonna give up
either part of me.

587
00:38:28,267 --> 00:38:30,321
And I'm not gonna apologize for it.

588
00:39:00,066 --> 00:39:01,603
There's a club--

589
00:39:02,777 --> 00:39:05,760
The dead dad's club...
And you can be in it until you're in it.

590
00:39:07,497 --> 00:39:12,053
You can try and understand, you can
sympathize, but until you feel that loss.

591
00:39:14,398 --> 00:39:17,012
My dad died when I was 9.

592
00:39:20,097 --> 00:39:27,160
George... I'm really sorry
you had to join the club.

593
00:39:32,808 --> 00:39:34,260
I...

594
00:39:37,545 --> 00:39:44,203
I don't know how to exist in a world
where my dad doesn't.

595
00:39:47,577 --> 00:39:50,853
Yeah, that never really changes.

596
00:40:14,348 --> 00:40:15,831
Beer, Joe, please.

597
00:40:18,477 --> 00:40:19,732
George's dad?

598
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,000
Hey.

599
00:40:34,946 --> 00:40:35,230
Hey.

600
00:40:38,995 --> 00:40:39,852
You got a dad?

601
00:40:41,476 --> 00:40:42,342
Not really.

602
00:40:43,155 --> 00:40:43,953
Not anymore.

603
00:41:55,665 --> 00:42:02,961
