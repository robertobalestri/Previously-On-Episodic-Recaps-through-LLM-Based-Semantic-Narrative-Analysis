1
00:00:00,043 --> 00:00:01,849
Previously on "Grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,093 --> 00:00:03,414
Marry me, Cristina Yang.

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,888
Are you saying yes?

4
00:00:05,364 --> 00:00:05,927
Y-yeah.

5
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:07,178
We're married!

6
00:00:07,442 --> 00:00:09,503
Adele and I are getting a divorce.

7
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:12,238
Has it even occurred to you
that maybe I'm not interested?

8
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,706
I raised you to be
an extraordinary human being.

9
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:20,146
So imagine my disappointment when I wake
up after five years and discover
that you're no more than ordinary.

10
00:00:20,246 --> 00:00:22,830
You want to know why I'm so ordinary?

11
00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:27,208
You want to know what happened
to me? You. You happened to me.

12
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,754
<i>Disappearances happen in science...</i>

13
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:36,333
<i>Disease can suddenly fade away,</i>

14
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:38,452
<i>tumors go missing.</i>

15
00:00:40,628 --> 00:00:43,362
<i>We open someone up to discover
the cancer is gone.</i>

16
00:00:44,287 --> 00:00:48,722
<i>It's unexplained, it's rare,
but it happens.</i>

17
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,511
<i>We call it misdiagnosis...</i>

18
00:00:51,678 --> 00:00:54,562
<i>say we never saw it in the first place...</i>

19
00:00:54,968 --> 00:00:56,823
<i>Any explanation but the truth.</i>

20
00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:02,122
<i>That life is full of vanishing acts.</i>

21
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:07,651
<i>If something that we didn't know
we had disappears,</i>

22
00:01:08,288 --> 00:01:09,653
<i>do we miss it?</i>

23
00:01:15,346 --> 00:01:15,801
Meredith.

24
00:01:20,986 --> 00:01:23,623
Meredith!
What are you doing?

25
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:36,580
- That's not a bath. I know what
a bath looks like.
- Drop it.

26
00:01:36,626 --> 00:01:37,841
- Look, your mother...
- Drop it.

27
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:38,533
Your mother...

28
00:01:39,578 --> 00:01:42,082
Look, your mother was lucid, and she
said things, and now she's...

29
00:01:42,138 --> 00:01:42,590
Gone,

30
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:45,261
and everything's back to normal.
It's not a big deal.

31
00:01:45,317 --> 00:01:46,842
Yeah, except she's having
heart surgery today.

32
00:01:47,378 --> 00:01:49,110
Hey, do you want
me to talk to the chief?

33
00:01:49,685 --> 00:01:52,271
I know you have the triage thing today,
but he'll give you the day off.

34
00:01:52,356 --> 00:01:52,600
Stop.

35
00:01:52,776 --> 00:01:54,273
I do not need rescuing.

36
00:01:54,336 --> 00:01:56,880
Oh, you would have drowned in the
bath tub had I not been there.

37
00:01:58,836 --> 00:02:01,152
I'm a surgeon. I do the rescuing.

38
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,772
You are not my knight in shining...
whatever.

39
00:02:03,818 --> 00:02:05,782
So we're gonna fight because
I pulled you out of the tub?

40
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:08,331
You have a place. You could sleep at it.

41
00:02:08,448 --> 00:02:10,210
And then you don't have to pull
me out of the bathtub.

42
00:02:10,455 --> 00:02:12,451
You're everywhere,
all the time, saying things.

43
00:02:12,515 --> 00:02:13,843
This is the happy ever after part.

44
00:02:13,936 --> 00:02:17,360
And in the happily ever after part, the
guy is there, all the time, saying things,

45
00:02:17,407 --> 00:02:18,533
and the girls love it.

46
00:02:18,915 --> 00:02:20,243
Go to work. I'll see you there.

47
00:02:20,438 --> 00:02:23,612
Just for the record,
I am your knight in shining whatever.

48
00:02:26,756 --> 00:02:27,601
Good morning!

49
00:02:29,307 --> 00:02:31,783
I did not try to drown myself
in the bathtub.

50
00:02:31,957 --> 00:02:34,562
Hey, I ate everything out
of the fridge last night,

51
00:02:34,645 --> 00:02:37,551
everything, including a tub of butter.

52
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:39,751
There's no judgment here.

53
00:02:41,585 --> 00:02:43,623
You ever feel like
you were disappearing?

54
00:02:44,305 --> 00:02:45,543
All the time.

55
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:48,013
Why can't I just be that
happily ever after person?

56
00:02:48,088 --> 00:02:49,662
Why can't I believe in that?

57
00:02:50,977 --> 00:02:52,953
I don't know what I believe in anymore.

58
00:03:02,595 --> 00:03:05,061
- We're not telling people.
- I haven't told anyone.

59
00:03:05,097 --> 00:03:06,413
I know, I know. Just don't.

60
00:03:07,677 --> 00:03:08,500
I'm not going to,

61
00:03:09,018 --> 00:03:11,820
- yet.
- No, I just... I need to tell
my friends he first.

62
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:14,043
But I have friends here.

63
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:18,292
Shepherd.

64
00:03:19,035 --> 00:03:19,980
Oh, no. You can't tell Shepherd.

65
00:03:20,038 --> 00:03:23,021
You cannot tell Shepherd until I've
told Meredith. It would be a thing.

66
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:25,770
You act like this is a disaster.

67
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:27,972
The world won't implode if people know.

68
00:03:30,386 --> 00:03:32,470
I will tell them, today

69
00:03:32,977 --> 00:03:35,611
Just...
Wait.

70
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:56,011
Good morning.
Morning. Morning.

71
00:03:58,217 --> 00:03:59,480
What's different?

72
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:02,371
- Nothing.
- Leave him be.

73
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:05,170
What happened to your hair?

74
00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:07,530
- Nothing.
- Mm-hmm.

75
00:04:20,008 --> 00:04:20,853
What happened to your hair?

76
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,341
Leave him be.

77
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:24,011
He dyed it.

78
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:25,822
But why?

79
00:04:26,427 --> 00:04:27,723
Leave him be.

80
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:29,231
- What am I doing?
- What?

81
00:04:29,585 --> 00:04:30,361
Okay, but why?

82
00:04:33,947 --> 00:04:37,793
Men  who have gray hair are noticed less
than men who don't.

83
00:04:39,508 --> 00:04:40,690
By who?

84
00:04:44,775 --> 00:04:46,353
- Well...
- By the ladies?

85
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,260
- Looks good, chief.
- Oh, very natural.

86
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:55,972
Ladies will love it.

87
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:01,480
He is alone... all alone.

88
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:03,282
Do any of you even know
what that's like?

89
00:05:03,425 --> 00:05:05,923
Lives with Cristina,
dates the perfect 12 year old...

90
00:05:06,527 --> 00:05:07,433
man-whore...

91
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:11,423
his wife left him after
25 years of marriage.

92
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:14,883
So if the man wants to dye
his hair for the ladies,

93
00:05:14,955 --> 00:05:16,832
Let him dye his hair
for the ladies.

94
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:17,452
Leave him be.

95
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,920
It's weird. It's weird.
It's weird, right?

96
00:05:25,286 --> 00:05:27,670
I need more triage tear tags.

97
00:05:27,907 --> 00:05:29,893
Living with somebody
I'm married to is weird.

98
00:05:29,977 --> 00:05:32,070
I mean, I'm his boss and his wife.

99
00:05:32,436 --> 00:05:34,501
At work, I'm giving him orders.
In bed,

100
00:05:35,207 --> 00:05:37,571
- he's giving me...
- Stop right there. I don't need to know this.

101
00:05:37,717 --> 00:05:38,983
I'm tired. I'm busy.

102
00:05:39,058 --> 00:05:42,562
While I will concede you and O'Malley
have some challenges to overcome,

103
00:05:42,626 --> 00:05:45,543
I'm asking you to remember that this day
is a marathon

104
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:47,462
and my mind can only hold
what it needs to know.

105
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:49,591
Your sex life cannot be held in
my mind today.

106
00:05:49,945 --> 00:05:51,891
Ever. It cannot be held
in my mind ever,

107
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:52,371
Never.

108
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:57,871
Whatever. Sydney Heron here
to lend a hand. Hey. Hi. Hello.

109
00:05:58,188 --> 00:06:01,183
Oh, Miranda, hey.
Nice clinic. Very nice.

110
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:01,732
Hey, Sydney.

111
00:06:01,997 --> 00:06:05,082
I mean real, real nice. Cheerful.

112
00:06:05,745 --> 00:06:08,070
No better way to distinguish
yourself for chief resident

113
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,581
than to open a
multimillion-dollar clinic.

114
00:06:10,698 --> 00:06:12,030
Smart thinking. Strategic.

115
00:06:12,507 --> 00:06:13,352
Chief resident?

116
00:06:13,468 --> 00:06:16,980
I myself have used the time to master
several complex surgical procedures.

117
00:06:17,765 --> 00:06:19,922
But this is, um, another way to go.

118
00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:21,240
What is she talking about? 

119
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:22,893
- The chief resident.
- The chief resident.

120
00:06:23,307 --> 00:06:27,093
Yeah, for next year. The one fifth-year
resident that rules all residents.

121
00:06:27,605 --> 00:06:32,133
Oh, she... Okay, she's cute. She's acting
like she didn't know about it. Cute.

122
00:06:32,285 --> 00:06:33,733
- I'm not cute.
- I'm on to you.

123
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:37,333
- Okay, I'm a competitor. Grr.
- I bite.

124
00:06:38,257 --> 00:06:41,161
Okay. Well, I'll just
wait for you in the pit.

125
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:10,691
What?

126
00:07:11,947 --> 00:07:12,883
Nothing.

127
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:24,663
What?!

128
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:27,950
Okay,  Cranky. Fo-forget it.

129
00:07:28,277 --> 00:07:30,340
Am I the only one who thinks this triage
test is a waste of time?

130
00:07:30,847 --> 00:07:33,763
There's a platysmaplasty on the board.
I had Sloan all prepped to let me scrub in.

131
00:07:34,405 --> 00:07:35,010
George, hey.

132
00:07:35,415 --> 00:07:36,743
- Hey.
- How's it going?
- Good.

133
00:07:37,448 --> 00:07:38,680
You like living in a hotel?

134
00:07:38,737 --> 00:07:40,220
Yeah, it's good.

135
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,563
'Cause your room's still there...

136
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:43,681
next to mine.

137
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:45,942
- Oh, Izzie.
- I'm just saying, if you don't like...

138
00:07:46,637 --> 00:07:49,640
the hotel, you can always
just move right back in.

139
00:07:49,757 --> 00:07:53,472
You think I'm this boy that you need
to save. I get that, but...

140
00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:57,123
and it...It would be sweet if...
If it weren't so condescending.

141
00:07:57,426 --> 00:08:00,530
Seriously, is it too much to ask
to be performing actual surgeries?

142
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:01,901
We are actual surgeons.

143
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:07,100
What?

144
00:08:08,402 --> 00:08:09,008
Nothing.

145
00:08:11,201 --> 00:08:12,734
A lot of arm swelling,

146
00:08:12,906 --> 00:08:14,873
but good distal pulses,
so...

147
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:17,073
we can rule out compartment syndrome.

148
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:20,033
I suspect a radius fracture,
so I'd splint

149
00:08:20,445 --> 00:08:21,993
and get an ortho follow-up.

150
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:22,911
Anything else?

151
00:08:24,925 --> 00:08:25,472
No.

152
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,230
Okay.

153
00:08:27,016 --> 00:08:28,690
- Then I guess this means...
- Time.

154
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,580
- And I'm dead.
- Dead?

155
00:08:33,987 --> 00:08:36,352
You sent her home. The bone
punctured through her skin.

156
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:38,493
Yeah, but she had multiple
wounds and abrasions...

157
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:41,210
A puncture over a break is an open
fracture until proven otherwise.

158
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:43,481
Yeah, I got septic, and I
died at home thanks to you.

159
00:08:43,795 --> 00:08:44,340
Oh, whatever.

160
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:47,751
Not "whatever" to dead
"minor puncture wound that's not" guy.

161
00:08:47,878 --> 00:08:50,950
You have to be quick and thorough
while using your instincts.

162
00:08:50,976 --> 00:08:52,842
You can't be fooled
by what your eyes see.

163
00:08:52,877 --> 00:08:55,362
If your assess wrong, your patient
could die while waiting for treatment.

164
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:56,181
Karev, you're next.

165
00:08:57,928 --> 00:09:00,570
Just think, I've already killed her.
You can't do more damage than that.

166
00:09:00,785 --> 00:09:04,330
People, triage is one of the most
important tools a doctor has.

167
00:09:04,435 --> 00:09:07,090
In a real emergent scenario,
you'll have only minutes.

168
00:09:07,185 --> 00:09:09,710
And it's something you'll be
tested on in your surgical ex...

169
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:12,441
- Sorry.
- George.

170
00:09:12,705 --> 00:09:14,151
I was just recording the drill.

171
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:17,451
- Yeah.
- All right, we're working George, okay?

172
00:09:17,476 --> 00:09:18,551
- I'm your boss right now.
- Yes.

173
00:09:19,076 --> 00:09:20,583
- All right?
- Yes. A very sexy one.

174
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:23,821
- No, no, no. You cannot undermine my
authority in front of the other interns,
- No... Yeah...

175
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:25,050
- in front of my peers.
- No.

176
00:09:25,477 --> 00:09:28,083
O'Malley, take that back to
the clinic where it belongs.

177
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:28,510
Sorry.

178
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:30,003
People.

179
00:09:30,396 --> 00:09:32,630
Look, I'm sorry. I have to interrupt
the session for a moment.

180
00:09:32,686 --> 00:09:33,793
Chief, I like your new hair.

181
00:09:33,838 --> 00:09:35,460
It really brings out your eyes.

182
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:38,343
Do you need something, sir?

183
00:09:38,436 --> 00:09:41,152
We just received word of
a mass casualty incident nearby.

184
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:44,070
All available level one trauma centers
have been asked to respond.

185
00:09:44,095 --> 00:09:46,143
I need to send a team
into the field immediately.

186
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:50,071
Is  this a part of the exercise? Are we
supposed to act appropriately, uh, tense?

187
00:09:50,136 --> 00:09:51,983
This is not an exercise
or a drill, Yang.

188
00:09:52,488 --> 00:09:55,082
This is an emergent situation,
and I need all hands on deck.

189
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,361
- Seriously?
- What happened?

190
00:09:56,407 --> 00:09:57,953
I don't have details, just orders.

191
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:09,050
Meredith, I have a thing, news.

192
00:10:09,287 --> 00:10:10,422
You aren't pregnant again, are you?

193
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:12,522
'Cause I can't handle the extra
months of bitchiness.

194
00:10:13,428 --> 00:10:15,460
We're catching a ride with Seattle 34.

195
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:17,810
Space is tight, so
hold your kits on your lap.

196
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:18,800
Where are we going?

197
00:10:18,956 --> 00:10:19,973
We'll know when we get there.

198
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:22,691
Fire, flood, volcano? I'm not
really dressed for a volcano.

199
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,892
- Stevens.
- Sorry. Inappropriate. Sorry.

200
00:10:24,935 --> 00:10:25,871
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

201
00:10:26,677 --> 00:10:28,622
I'm hauling supplies.
I only have room for five.

202
00:10:30,268 --> 00:10:30,660
Yang.

203
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:31,302
Yes?

204
00:10:31,346 --> 00:10:34,712
Stay with the chief. Take care of the
incoming wounded. The rest of you, come on.

205
00:10:35,008 --> 00:10:36,382
Stevens was inappropriate. 

206
00:10:37,477 --> 00:10:39,730
Hey, what was your, uh, news?

207
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,690
Just forget it. Forget it.

208
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:10,080
Oh, everybody, move your I. D. S
to the outside of your jacket.

209
00:11:10,496 --> 00:11:12,463
When we get there, remember, triage.

210
00:11:12,687 --> 00:11:13,303
Karev.

211
00:11:13,627 --> 00:11:17,061
Green tags: non emergent. Yellow: delayed care.
Red tags: needs immediate treatment.

212
00:11:17,306 --> 00:11:22,052
Good. Assess carefully, tag and get all
the critical patients into the ambulances

213
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:26,173
as fast as possible. Don't get in the way
of Search and Rescue, and stay calm.

214
00:11:26,277 --> 00:11:29,651
-  Any word yet on what happened?
- All we know is there are multiple traumas.

215
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:56,773
Holy mother of...

216
00:12:36,608 --> 00:12:38,143
Dr. Bailey, where do you need us?

217
00:12:40,017 --> 00:12:41,752
Where should we start first?

218
00:12:43,106 --> 00:12:43,702
Dr. Bailey--

219
00:12:44,048 --> 00:12:47,250
I don't have time to hold your hands.
You know the protocol. Go do it.

220
00:12:47,338 --> 00:12:49,170
- Do what?
- Go help people.

221
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,330
- You need some help?
- There's nothing more I can do here.

222
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:13,713
How did this happen?

223
00:13:14,258 --> 00:13:16,862
It was a fog bank. Container ship
clipped the ferry.

224
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,701
Take a deep breath for me.

225
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:25,770
Okay, you're gonna be okay.

226
00:13:25,798 --> 00:13:28,993
Your injuries are minor. An E.M.T. is gonna
come and take you to the hospital, okay?

227
00:13:36,985 --> 00:13:38,360
Is this your mommy?

228
00:13:41,797 --> 00:13:43,042
Who are you with?

229
00:13:47,457 --> 00:13:51,141
Okay, I want you to stay right here,
okay? Stay right here.

230
00:13:53,557 --> 00:13:55,373
Did you... wet your pants?

231
00:13:56,428 --> 00:13:58,081
That's okay. It happens sometimes

232
00:13:57,615 --> 00:13:58,721
Coming through!

233
00:14:13,876 --> 00:14:17,323
It just doesn't make sense.
Ferry boats don't get in accidents.

234
00:14:17,695 --> 00:14:19,103
They're safe.
They're reliable.

235
00:14:20,065 --> 00:14:24,091
The moment you take one for granted,
along comes a container ship and boom.

236
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:27,781
I have a thing for ferry boats.

237
00:14:30,307 --> 00:14:33,352
Reschedule,  uh, Swanson's,
uh, valve replacement.

238
00:14:33,435 --> 00:14:34,590
We're gonna need the O.R.

239
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,913
- For the incoming from the ferry accident.
- Okay

240
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:38,941
I mean, this whole day had just been...

241
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:43,030
There's something wrong with Meredith.

242
00:14:43,445 --> 00:14:45,432
I asked her what's wrong.
She says nothing.

243
00:14:45,658 --> 00:14:47,281
Then she tries to drowned
herself in the tub.

244
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:50,651
N... not actually drowned,
I don't think.

245
00:14:50,898 --> 00:14:52,151
But something was going on,

246
00:14:52,565 --> 00:14:53,852
and she will not talk about it.

247
00:14:54,345 --> 00:14:55,841
We were fine, and now it's like...

248
00:14:57,527 --> 00:14:59,253
I'm living with a ghost.

249
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:01,850
- You're confiding in me.
- Yes.

250
00:15:05,098 --> 00:15:07,580
Cristina and I are engaged.

251
00:15:09,697 --> 00:15:11,220
Congratulations.

252
00:15:12,326 --> 00:15:13,932
I mean, she doesn't want to tell anyone.

253
00:15:14,828 --> 00:15:16,530
At least not until she
tells Meredith first.

254
00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:19,010
Yeah, they're different
than other women.

255
00:15:19,388 --> 00:15:20,400
Yes, these women...

256
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,070
Yes, they are.

257
00:15:23,116 --> 00:15:25,193
You know, maybe we'll never know them.
I mean, really know them.

258
00:15:25,395 --> 00:15:27,513
And now that you and Cristina are
engaged, you've got a lot of work to do.

259
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:28,050
You right

260
00:15:29,768 --> 00:15:31,113
You and Yang are gettin' hitched?

261
00:15:35,457 --> 00:15:39,053
There's a mass casualty
incident rolling in,

262
00:15:40,518 --> 00:15:43,333
There'll probably be some burn victims.
You should be prepared.

263
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:57,711
Sydney. I thought I could take
a few patients off your... hands.

264
00:15:57,985 --> 00:16:00,602
I appreciate the gesture,
dr. Callie O'Malley.

265
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,691
but the chief asked me to roll the
non emergent E.R. Cases into the clinic

266
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:08,382
and take care of them, so I've triaged
these patients, and so far it looks like a

267
00:16:08,748 --> 00:16:11,703
a sore throat, a sprain and a
tummy ache... Easy breezy.

268
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:13,353
So the clinic and I are fine.

269
00:16:13,456 --> 00:16:16,721
Okay, I'm not, uh, trying
to take the clinic...

270
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:20,461
Uh, Bailey's Clinic, by the way away
from you. I'm offering to help, so...

271
00:16:20,806 --> 00:16:24,593
your offer to help is duly noted and very
much appreciated, but I promise you...

272
00:16:24,927 --> 00:16:25,780
Got it all under control.

273
00:16:25,996 --> 00:16:27,072
So...Jason Kaye?

274
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,143
Fine.

275
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:30,952
I'll leave you to it

276
00:16:31,126 --> 00:16:35,882
and, uh, find myself a recently traumatized
emergency surgery to scrub in on while

277
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:40,683
you stay down here with your sore throat
and your sprain and...

278
00:16:40,937 --> 00:16:44,312
- What was the other one?
- Tummy ache.

279
00:16:50,957 --> 00:16:51,960
Jason Kaye?

280
00:17:02,176 --> 00:17:04,743
Are you a nurse, a doctor,
m...medical something?

281
00:17:04,865 --> 00:17:05,672
I'm a doctor, but...

282
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:06,272
Come with me.

283
00:17:06,376 --> 00:17:08,253
Um, no, you... you need
to get checked out.

284
00:17:08,308 --> 00:17:09,610
There's a treatment area
right over there.

285
00:17:09,635 --> 00:17:10,450
Follow me, please.

286
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,680
You've got some really bad
burns. They need to be treated.

287
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:14,610
My buddy's trapped.
He's trapped under a car.

288
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:17,480
If he's trapped under a car,
you need Search and Rescue.

289
00:17:17,506 --> 00:17:19,392
They have... they have personnel...
their medical personnel...

290
00:17:18,735 --> 00:17:20,492
I called them.
They're backed up, and he can't wait.

291
00:17:20,697 --> 00:17:21,922
He's in a real bad way.

292
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:25,321
Please. He's my best buddy.
Please.

293
00:17:30,388 --> 00:17:32,080
Shepherd, I need you in the next rig.

294
00:17:32,258 --> 00:17:33,551
- Okay.
- I want you at that scene.

295
00:17:34,157 --> 00:17:35,101
You don't need me here?

296
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:39,263
They're reporting lots of closed
head injuries. I want you go get
in there and bring'em back alive.

297
00:17:40,616 --> 00:17:41,872
Okay, what's the news?

298
00:17:42,038 --> 00:17:45,952
Shepherd and Grey are on the rocks.
Burke and Yang got engaged.

299
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:59,393
You need highlights. In your hair...
that's why it looks so odd.

300
00:18:00,268 --> 00:18:01,742
I'm gonna go save lives.

301
00:18:10,247 --> 00:18:13,142
Take him to the treatment area.
They'll fix you up there, okay?

302
00:18:14,275 --> 00:18:15,863
Come on, let's go!

303
00:18:20,657 --> 00:18:21,993
I got somebody down here.

304
00:18:27,098 --> 00:18:30,600
Hey!
That's not secure.

305
00:18:42,675 --> 00:18:46,131
- Doctor, I need you to get back up here.
- There's a pregnant woman down here!
Just shut the...

306
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,110
Oh, hell.

307
00:18:48,068 --> 00:18:48,822
She dead?

308
00:18:51,686 --> 00:18:52,463
Yeah.

309
00:19:11,355 --> 00:19:13,092
Hold on. Hold on.

310
00:19:23,527 --> 00:19:25,621
Immediate! Immediate!
I need help down here!

311
00:19:31,266 --> 00:19:34,130
He's back. He's got help.

312
00:19:34,685 --> 00:19:35,913
You hear that, Rick? We got help.

313
00:19:37,028 --> 00:19:38,061
We got a doctor.

314
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,631
You'll be okay now, man.
He's gonna be okay?

315
00:19:43,737 --> 00:19:44,351
Right?

316
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:56,862
What we know at this time, what we can
tell you is that there have been deaths.

317
00:19:57,407 --> 00:20:00,452
We don't know how many... and we may not
know that for hours or even days

318
00:20:01,048 --> 00:20:04,262
We also know that passengers
are still being evacuated...

319
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:07,082
A ferry of this size can carry
anywhere up to a thousand or...

320
00:20:07,146 --> 00:20:09,173
All right, you're gonna need
these to handle the influx.

321
00:20:09,257 --> 00:20:12,731
We're gonna need plenty of available
open chest trays, central line kits

322
00:20:12,898 --> 00:20:15,050
- and a difficult intubation cart.
- Yes, sir.

323
00:20:19,248 --> 00:20:22,823
- Oh, Yang.
- I know. Communicate with the scene
as needed.

324
00:20:23,895 --> 00:20:26,672
No.
I heard you were engaged.

325
00:20:27,178 --> 00:20:28,221
Congratulations.

326
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,051
Thank you, Sir.

327
00:20:30,615 --> 00:20:34,931
All right go, and remember, we're hoping
for the best but preparing for the worst.

328
00:20:45,516 --> 00:20:46,731
You got anyone for me?

329
00:20:47,118 --> 00:20:49,383
Uh, yeah, those two need
to be transported.

330
00:20:49,497 --> 00:20:52,261
Uh, these five didn't make it...
four adults and one child.

331
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,340
A child?

332
00:20:53,736 --> 00:20:54,870
You found a dead child?

333
00:20:55,278 --> 00:20:55,860
A boy or girl?

334
00:20:55,918 --> 00:20:58,411
Ma'am, you're injured. You need to
lie down. Get a stretcher, now.

335
00:20:58,668 --> 00:21:01,602
Is the child a boy or a girl?
I can't find my son.

336
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:05,312
We got separated I... I need to know
if my little boy is alive.

337
00:21:05,488 --> 00:21:06,190
She was a girl.

338
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:08,663
The child was a little girl. No, no,
no, no. I need to examine you.

339
00:21:08,737 --> 00:21:09,983
I'm gonna have to take you
to the hospital.

340
00:21:09,975 --> 00:21:11,022
No, I can't leave!

341
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:14,033
- He's only 7. No!
And... and he's all alone.
- No

342
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:17,203
- No, I will not leave my son behind.
- No! No, I will find him.

343
00:21:17,437 --> 00:21:18,493
Listen to me.

344
00:21:19,187 --> 00:21:19,951
I will find him.

345
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:23,712
If you let me take you to triage,
I promise you I will find your son.

346
00:21:24,536 --> 00:21:27,382
- He's so scared.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

347
00:21:28,526 --> 00:21:29,910
I'll find him.

348
00:21:30,147 --> 00:21:31,232
- Okay.
- Okay?

349
00:21:31,488 --> 00:21:32,390
All right.

350
00:21:35,998 --> 00:21:39,543
He's a mechanic. We... we work together.
We... we drive together to work,

351
00:21:39,606 --> 00:21:42,611
and... and suddenly there was this
huge jolt. It was awful.

352
00:21:42,908 --> 00:21:44,730
We were just trying to get outta there.
But Rick went back in...

353
00:21:44,758 --> 00:21:45,680
figured we could help.

354
00:21:45,947 --> 00:21:46,663
We should help.

355
00:21:46,947 --> 00:21:49,042
He went back. There were people trapped. 
He was trying to help.

356
00:21:49,216 --> 00:21:50,862
We were behind him.
We... we were right behind him.

357
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,631
There are injuries to his chest and leg.
It looks like his arm is broken,

358
00:21:53,715 --> 00:21:56,103
and I'd guess there's damage
to his spine and pelvis. I can't...

359
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,421
there's... there's not much that I can
do until we get him out of here.

360
00:22:02,366 --> 00:22:04,710
You gotta do what you can.

361
00:22:05,848 --> 00:22:06,892
I mean, we'll, uh...

362
00:22:07,808 --> 00:22:09,513
Greg, go find some more guys.

363
00:22:09,665 --> 00:22:11,973
Hey,  go find Search and Rescue, okay?

364
00:22:12,276 --> 00:22:13,221
Give them this.

365
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:16,750
Tell them I said he can't wait.
He has to get to a hospital.

366
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:17,713
All right, I'm going.

367
00:22:22,058 --> 00:22:25,562
Let'em know he needs a C.T. Make sure to
keep his neck stable. I felt a step off.

368
00:22:25,908 --> 00:22:28,801
Ask for Waller. If Waller's not
available, ask for Krychek, okay?

369
00:22:29,007 --> 00:22:30,193
Keep him stable.
What do you got?

370
00:22:30,205 --> 00:22:30,630
My God! Oh!

371
00:22:30,677 --> 00:22:32,972
Hey, nurse, let me have some
bandages. Thank you. Stop here.

372
00:22:33,777 --> 00:22:34,200
Derek.

373
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,043
- Hey, Meredith, you got a free hand?
Hold this bandage for me, will you?
- Yeah

374
00:22:38,265 --> 00:22:41,053
- You all right?
- Yeah, it's just a lot.

375
00:22:41,968 --> 00:22:43,180
Do you want to get married?

376
00:22:43,508 --> 00:22:46,030
and you haven't told me and I haven't
asked, so now we have a problem?

377
00:22:46,215 --> 00:22:46,610
What?

378
00:22:47,755 --> 00:22:50,240
No, I don't want to get married.
You want to get married

379
00:22:50,438 --> 00:22:51,203
No

380
00:22:51,446 --> 00:22:51,750
Good.

381
00:22:52,265 --> 00:22:53,441
So if that's not it, what is it?

382
00:22:54,176 --> 00:22:55,150
It isn't anything.

383
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:00,253
- Are you good? 'Cause I gotta
get this kid triaged.
- Yeah, I'm good.

384
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:00,521
- Okay.
- Let's go

385
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:01,280
She all right?

386
00:23:01,455 --> 00:23:02,703
Yeah, she's good. She's just lost.

387
00:23:04,586 --> 00:23:06,941
Hang in there. We're going to
the hospital soon okay?

388
00:23:11,118 --> 00:23:13,321
All the non emergent surgeries
have been postponed.

389
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:16,490
- Good.
- I'm gonna go check on discharges.

390
00:23:16,836 --> 00:23:19,713
I'm trying to free up as many beds
as I can in the surgical wing.

391
00:23:19,848 --> 00:23:20,460
Oh.

392
00:23:21,168 --> 00:23:23,473
- I was gonna do that, but...
- I can do it.

393
00:23:23,817 --> 00:23:25,112
Oh, sure. Good.

394
00:23:26,306 --> 00:23:28,171
- Unless you want to.
- No, no. Go ahead.

395
00:23:28,355 --> 00:23:31,271
- You're still the chief.
- I know that.

396
00:23:33,597 --> 00:23:36,433
- It just seems so quiet, you know?
- Yeah.

397
00:23:36,847 --> 00:23:39,180
We're expecting the first wave
from the scene soon.

398
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:49,772
I dyed my hair blonde...

399
00:23:51,586 --> 00:23:54,500
The day after Derek moved out.

400
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:59,230
Change is good. Your marriage is over.
You're...

401
00:24:00,146 --> 00:24:03,900
You're starting over.
So am I.

402
00:24:09,565 --> 00:24:10,841
Right.

403
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:20,473
I specifically told you I needed
to tell Meredith first.

404
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,373
I was talking to Shepherd, and...

405
00:24:23,058 --> 00:24:24,413
it just came out.

406
00:24:24,488 --> 00:24:27,283
- It was no big deal.
- It is a big deal,

407
00:24:27,707 --> 00:24:30,802
Because now she's not even gonna care
about the fact that I'm getting married.

408
00:24:30,876 --> 00:24:33,513
All she's gonna care about is the fact
that I didn't tell her myself.

409
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:34,890
Then why didn't you?

410
00:24:36,638 --> 00:24:38,950
There was a major disaster.

411
00:24:39,205 --> 00:24:41,662
That was 45 minutes
after we discussed it.

412
00:24:42,055 --> 00:24:44,533
You were with your friends
for 45 minutes

413
00:24:44,575 --> 00:24:47,463
running triage drills, and you weren't
compelled to mention it?

414
00:24:49,716 --> 00:24:51,590
The chief says they're
rolling in soon, so...

415
00:24:56,096 --> 00:24:59,250
Her pressure's low. Barely registering
and I don't see any good veins for an I.V.

416
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,102
She's all clamped down from hypothermia.
That's why I couldn't find a pulse.

417
00:25:02,146 --> 00:25:04,063
I've never seen a crush injury
so bad and survive.

418
00:25:04,658 --> 00:25:05,551
God, she's a mess

419
00:25:05,595 --> 00:25:06,993
She needs to stay on her left side.

420
00:25:07,057 --> 00:25:09,400
We gotta move her on her left side.

421
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:11,201
It's gonna take both of us.
We gotta get that B.P. up.

422
00:25:11,918 --> 00:25:12,611
On my count.

423
00:25:14,895 --> 00:25:17,082
One...
Two...

424
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:21,890
Your baby... Your baby's okay.

425
00:25:22,096 --> 00:25:23,831
For now it looks okay.

426
00:25:24,017 --> 00:25:25,383
Just try to breathe.

427
00:25:25,678 --> 00:25:28,163
We need to move you to help
with your circulation, okay?

428
00:25:29,775 --> 00:25:32,772
One, two, three.

429
00:25:36,896 --> 00:25:39,723
Pulse is already better.
I'll attempt I.V. access again.

430
00:25:39,807 --> 00:25:41,071
Just breathe through the pain.

431
00:25:41,258 --> 00:25:43,383
What you can do for your baby right now
is take care of yourself.

432
00:25:43,466 --> 00:25:44,302
Good girl.

433
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,320
Come on now.
Keep breathing for me, okay?

434
00:25:48,368 --> 00:25:49,002
That's it.

435
00:25:51,027 --> 00:25:52,911
Keep breathing.

436
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:06,512
Good.

437
00:26:07,496 --> 00:26:10,270
Um, what do we...
So what do we do?

438
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:12,602
We wait.

439
00:26:17,705 --> 00:26:18,642
We wait?

440
00:26:19,588 --> 00:26:20,921
We wait.

441
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:35,073
Okay, we need to find a grown-up...
Another grown-up... To help you

442
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:36,680
find your mom.

443
00:26:45,996 --> 00:26:49,400
Hey, uh, I need you to take
this little girl to the triage tents.

444
00:26:49,428 --> 00:26:50,651
I gotta get back to my unit.

445
00:26:50,685 --> 00:26:54,303
No, I need you to take this little girl
to the triage tents for me, please.

446
00:26:55,148 --> 00:26:56,081
You're gonna be okay.

447
00:26:56,337 --> 00:26:57,683
You're gonna be fine.

448
00:26:57,888 --> 00:27:00,002
I promise, okay?
Thanks.

449
00:27:07,048 --> 00:27:08,960
Help! I need some help over here!

450
00:27:10,006 --> 00:27:10,770
Stay right here.

451
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:20,840
How we doing?

452
00:27:21,176 --> 00:27:23,663
It's bad. A lot of survivors,
so that's something.

453
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:24,271
Yeah, it is.

454
00:27:24,678 --> 00:27:26,093
- Have you seen Stevens?
- No.

455
00:27:26,566 --> 00:27:28,123
What about O'Malley, Grey?

456
00:27:28,528 --> 00:27:29,150
Grey was...

457
00:27:29,218 --> 00:27:31,200
I saw Grey about ten minutes ago.
She was on her way over here with a kid.

458
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:32,672
- You haven't seen her?
- No.

459
00:27:33,348 --> 00:27:37,613
I gotta head out with this one, so keep
an eye out for my interns, all right?

460
00:27:37,015 --> 00:27:38,641
Yeah, I'll do my best.

461
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:52,460
Jane Doe, about six months pregnant,
found under a pile of rubble.

462
00:27:52,498 --> 00:27:54,002
She sustained crush injuries
to her right torso

463
00:27:54,016 --> 00:27:56,023
and upper extremities as well
as severe trauma to the face.

464
00:27:56,148 --> 00:27:58,261
B.P. Initially low,
but now up to 90 over 60

465
00:27:58,287 --> 00:27:59,910
after a liter of fluid and
placing her on her left side.

466
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,651
What do we do? Karev?

467
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:04,611
Abc...

468
00:28:04,738 --> 00:28:06,083
Her airway needs to be protected.

469
00:28:06,136 --> 00:28:08,620
Her breathing will be compromised
because of the crush injury,

470
00:28:08,865 --> 00:28:10,150
and we need to have blood available.

471
00:28:10,177 --> 00:28:12,191
I would do a trauma panel,
type and cross

472
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:13,373
and C.T. of her head and neck.

473
00:28:13,415 --> 00:28:15,682
Excellent. Let's get her started.
Uh, trauma room two.

474
00:28:15,747 --> 00:28:16,200
- Let's go
- Right away

475
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:18,661
One, two and three.

476
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,610
Let's see what we have here.

477
00:28:28,727 --> 00:28:30,193
The baby... the baby's gonna...

478
00:28:30,268 --> 00:28:32,381
Make sure that you
shield her in radiology.

479
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:35,110
We've got to get her stabilized first
before you start worrying about the baby.

480
00:28:35,487 --> 00:28:36,791
The amount of rads are negligible.

481
00:28:36,826 --> 00:28:39,393
Right, but she's gonna need a lot
before all of this is over.

482
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:40,542
We need to protect them both.

483
00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:42,590
Yang, you're on this.

484
00:28:42,698 --> 00:28:44,032
Alex, go to the clinic.

485
00:28:44,228 --> 00:28:46,480
The victims families are there.
They need answers.

486
00:28:46,586 --> 00:28:48,443
This is my patient. I pulled
her out of the damn water.

487
00:28:48,615 --> 00:28:52,392
Which is heroic and manly, and you still
need to talk to those families right now.

488
00:28:52,425 --> 00:28:53,411
Why can't Yang do it?

489
00:28:53,438 --> 00:28:54,520
This is all hands on deck.

490
00:28:54,846 --> 00:28:56,333
Yang can handle this. Now go.

491
00:29:09,506 --> 00:29:09,873
Okay

492
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:12,873
He likes fire trucks...

493
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:15,970
and police cars...
Anything with flashing lights.

494
00:29:16,197 --> 00:29:18,700
Carlee Heit, 45-year-old female,
found at the scene.

495
00:29:18,737 --> 00:29:21,153
Open abdominal wound
with horizontal evisceration.

496
00:29:21,237 --> 00:29:23,583
Okay, we need to get her to an O.R.
As soon as possible.

497
00:29:23,718 --> 00:29:25,780
He won't respond
if you call him Christopher.

498
00:29:25,825 --> 00:29:27,511
He hates that. Just Chris.

499
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:28,741
- Okay.
- He likes Chris the best.

500
00:29:28,765 --> 00:29:30,233
O'Malley, what is she talking about?

501
00:29:30,276 --> 00:29:31,592
She lost track of her son
in the accident.

502
00:29:31,665 --> 00:29:33,273
Dr. O'Malley and I made a deal.

503
00:29:33,718 --> 00:29:34,902
He's gonna find my son

504
00:29:35,226 --> 00:29:36,622
so I know that Chris is okay

505
00:29:36,747 --> 00:29:37,952
before I go into surgery.

506
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:40,111
Mrs. Heit, your injury's
extremely serious.

507
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:41,950
We need to tend to it
as soon as possible.

508
00:29:42,006 --> 00:29:45,691
As soon as he's located. I can't go into
surgery before I know about my son

509
00:29:45,715 --> 00:29:47,162
I'm sure he's here.
All families are being dir...

510
00:29:47,095 --> 00:29:48,520
O'Malley, just find the boy

511
00:29:48,547 --> 00:29:50,152
in a hurry, and we'll start the workup.

512
00:30:16,236 --> 00:30:17,871
I need more gauze.

513
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,912
There's no more here.

514
00:30:20,676 --> 00:30:23,122
Maybe you could find some, uh,
paper towels the head?

515
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,243
I'll find something.

516
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:25,051
Vince...

517
00:30:25,896 --> 00:30:28,013
Vince, it hurts like hell.

518
00:30:28,265 --> 00:30:30,751
Can you do anything about that? I mean,
can...you got anything for the pain?

519
00:30:31,035 --> 00:30:32,283
I've given him everything I've got.

520
00:30:32,947 --> 00:30:35,020
- Where is Search and Rescue?
- It hurts.

521
00:30:35,775 --> 00:30:36,742
What hurts, man?

522
00:30:40,876 --> 00:30:41,530
E... everything.

523
00:30:42,627 --> 00:30:45,443
Maybe if... maybe if I try to set
his arm, it'll help some with the pain.

524
00:30:45,565 --> 00:30:46,403
What are you waiting for?

525
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:48,103
I, uh, um...

526
00:30:48,987 --> 00:30:49,282
What?

527
00:30:50,755 --> 00:30:52,751
- What?
- Nothing. Just, uh, just stay
there and hold his hand.

528
00:30:52,837 --> 00:30:53,450
Hold his hand?

529
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:55,530
You think he's in pain now?
He's not. Hold his hand.

530
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:59,391
Place both hands on opposite
sides of the fracture...

531
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:06,821
Distract, exaggerate and reverse
the mechanism in one continuous motion.

532
00:31:08,807 --> 00:31:09,891
You are a doctor, aren't you?

533
00:31:10,205 --> 00:31:10,820
Shut up.

534
00:31:11,176 --> 00:31:11,593
All right.

535
00:31:12,975 --> 00:31:14,422
All right. Rick, you ready?

536
00:31:16,257 --> 00:31:16,671
Yeah.

537
00:31:22,076 --> 00:31:22,593
One...

538
00:31:28,085 --> 00:31:28,751
Two...

539
00:31:34,965 --> 00:31:36,933
Aah!

540
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:38,680
What happened?

541
00:31:38,795 --> 00:31:41,562
Some metal... Something in my leg...
Thrown off.

542
00:31:42,876 --> 00:31:44,711
- God, it hurts. It hurts.
- Okay.

543
00:31:45,068 --> 00:31:46,390
I started swimming.

544
00:31:46,555 --> 00:31:49,881
I needed to go... Got a meeting.

545
00:31:51,818 --> 00:31:53,732
Aah!

546
00:31:53,757 --> 00:31:56,592
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Sir.
But try to stay still.

547
00:31:56,668 --> 00:31:59,101
Oh. Oh.

548
00:32:09,016 --> 00:32:10,602
Don't look. Turn around.

549
00:32:15,197 --> 00:32:16,672
I need you to be brave for me.

550
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:19,982
Just stand right there and don't move
and don't look.

551
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:34,883
What do we got?

552
00:32:34,898 --> 00:32:35,981
Oh, we just got started.

553
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:37,901
All right.

554
00:32:38,818 --> 00:32:39,661
But I got this.

555
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:42,500
There's nobody covering my service.

556
00:32:42,546 --> 00:32:45,071
I'm gonna need you to get up to
telemetry and check on my patients,

557
00:32:45,147 --> 00:32:46,182
pre-op and post-op.

558
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:48,740
And then I should join you in surgery?

559
00:32:49,305 --> 00:32:51,720
No. And then you should
report to the pit.

560
00:32:52,536 --> 00:32:54,732
Uh, the Chief assigned me to Jane Doe.

561
00:32:54,805 --> 00:32:56,210
Yes. Now I'm reassigning you.

562
00:32:56,368 --> 00:32:57,520
To do what, sutures?

563
00:32:58,675 --> 00:32:59,060
Yes.

564
00:33:01,266 --> 00:33:03,332
Okay, so... So you're saying you don't...
you don't want me to scrub in.

565
00:33:04,157 --> 00:33:08,323
Dr. Yang, I'm saying that I have
an unattended cardiothoracic wing

566
00:33:08,717 --> 00:33:11,992
and a pit full of patients
that you have the ability to help.

567
00:33:12,016 --> 00:33:14,583
I don't need you in the O.R.
I need you on the floor.

568
00:33:14,658 --> 00:33:16,203
Do you have a problem with that?

569
00:33:18,598 --> 00:33:18,782
No.

570
00:33:20,816 --> 00:33:21,320
Thank you.

571
00:33:27,445 --> 00:33:29,322
No, not... Chris Heit.

572
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:33,803
He's 7 years old. He's got brown hair.
I don't know if he's injured. I'm...

573
00:33:35,405 --> 00:33:37,281
Could you at least check
to see if he's there?

574
00:33:38,878 --> 00:33:41,283
Yes, I know all the families were
directed here. Could you just check?

575
00:33:42,537 --> 00:33:43,161
Thank you. Yeah.

576
00:33:43,636 --> 00:33:45,800
Callie, I need some help.

577
00:33:46,377 --> 00:33:47,220
I can't. I'm busy.

578
00:33:47,246 --> 00:33:49,982
Yeah, okay. It's just, uh,
I'm trying to find this...

579
00:33:49,997 --> 00:33:53,813
George, I'm busy. I'm about to go into
surgery, okay? I can't be your wife
right now. I'm working.

580
00:33:54,316 --> 00:33:55,831
I'm working, too. I have a patient who
needs surgery.

581
00:33:55,927 --> 00:33:56,500
So do I.

582
00:34:00,048 --> 00:34:00,961
Yes, any luck?

583
00:34:02,606 --> 00:34:03,141
Thank you.

584
00:34:06,926 --> 00:34:08,022
Okay. Damn it.

585
00:34:11,926 --> 00:34:13,953
Can I get some help over here?

586
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:21,021
Sweetie, listen to me.
I need you to turn around

587
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,523
I know I told you to face away from me,

588
00:34:24,628 --> 00:34:26,651
but we have to work together
to help this man.

589
00:34:29,998 --> 00:34:31,792
I don't talk either when I get scared.

590
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:33,691
I don't...

591
00:34:34,896 --> 00:34:36,470
talk when bad things happen.

592
00:34:37,478 --> 00:34:38,990
You don't have to say anything.

593
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:41,030
But I need your help.

594
00:34:50,147 --> 00:34:52,762
Okay, don't look down. Don't look
at the blood. Look at me.

595
00:34:53,276 --> 00:34:54,032
Look at me.

596
00:34:55,586 --> 00:34:57,141
Can you be my assistant?

597
00:34:58,818 --> 00:34:59,910
Okay, good.

598
00:35:00,308 --> 00:35:02,080
I can't move my hands off where
they are right now.

599
00:35:02,106 --> 00:35:03,552
So I need you to go over to my kit

600
00:35:03,697 --> 00:35:07,622
and pull out, uh, the things...
They look like, um, like tweezers.

601
00:35:07,676 --> 00:35:10,302
You know what your mommy uses
to pull a splinter out with?

602
00:35:18,047 --> 00:35:19,982
Hey, what was the site like?

603
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:22,920
Was it gory?
Was it a trauma Bonanza?

604
00:35:24,328 --> 00:35:25,601
Obviously terrible.

605
00:35:26,495 --> 00:35:28,123
I don't talk with thieves.

606
00:35:28,235 --> 00:35:28,571
What?

607
00:35:29,066 --> 00:35:30,753
You stole my Jane Doe right out
from under me.

608
00:35:30,808 --> 00:35:31,781
I am not a thief.

609
00:35:31,946 --> 00:35:33,330
You balked. You're a balker.

610
00:35:33,408 --> 00:35:34,191
I was thinking.

611
00:35:34,206 --> 00:35:37,443
Well, again, not my problem that thinking
is such a time-consuming process for you.

612
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:40,642
I rescued her. I climbed down. I pulled
a massive pylon off of her.

613
00:35:40,857 --> 00:35:41,683
I got her here alive.

614
00:35:41,788 --> 00:35:43,332
Pylons? There are pylons on people?

615
00:35:43,556 --> 00:35:44,183
Whatever.

616
00:35:44,358 --> 00:35:48,422
Now I get stuck babysitting the patients
families when you get to scrub in.

617
00:35:48,727 --> 00:35:52,802
Well, I'm not scrubbing in.
I'm stitching up patients in the pit.

618
00:35:53,047 --> 00:35:54,982
Ah who did you piss off to get that?

619
00:35:55,227 --> 00:35:59,252
I happen to be pulling gaping pieces
of flesh back together.

620
00:35:59,676 --> 00:36:04,003
You're stitching. You're just one-step
closer to knitting your grandma a sweater.

621
00:36:04,086 --> 00:36:06,001
- Well, at least mine's medical.
- Well, you're knitting.

622
00:36:06,487 --> 00:36:07,653
I pull pylons off people.

623
00:36:10,848 --> 00:36:11,613
Orange juice?

624
00:36:11,985 --> 00:36:13,572
Orange juice?
Orange juice?

625
00:36:14,096 --> 00:36:15,841
Oh, sweetie.

626
00:36:16,165 --> 00:36:17,551
Yeah, h... his color's not good.

627
00:36:18,016 --> 00:36:19,212
Do you want some orange juice?

628
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:22,573
Maybe I have some wheat crackers,
something to put in your belly?

629
00:36:23,385 --> 00:36:23,720
No.

630
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:29,063
Everybody, if you're... If you're
waiting to hear about your families,

631
00:36:29,198 --> 00:36:31,900
we should be hearing something
very soon.

632
00:36:33,028 --> 00:36:33,800
I'm sorry.

633
00:36:39,938 --> 00:36:44,141
He must have saved at least a dozen
people who were stuck under cars.
We told him not to go back.

634
00:36:44,276 --> 00:36:45,812
That's the kinda guy he is.

635
00:36:46,128 --> 00:36:47,412
He's the guy that goes back.

636
00:36:48,315 --> 00:36:49,963
He's got kids, too, five of'em.

637
00:36:50,045 --> 00:36:53,803
Okay, I'm committed to the project.
I don't need to hear about the kids.

638
00:36:56,197 --> 00:36:57,891
Leave the girl alone, Vince.

639
00:36:58,137 --> 00:37:00,692
Sorry. You're doing a real
great job there, Doc.

640
00:37:02,528 --> 00:37:03,653
Hey, how's he doing?

641
00:37:03,696 --> 00:37:04,590
He's doing all right.

642
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,323
No, no, he's not.

643
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,751
I can't do anything more until
we get him out from under this car.

644
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:10,793
Can you please tell me why you've
come back by yourself?

645
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,502
Search and Rescue... They're buried.
They said they'd come when they can.

646
00:37:13,535 --> 00:37:15,512
Did you show them the red tag?
He's a red tag?

647
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:17,451
They said they got 15 red tags.

648
00:37:22,537 --> 00:37:25,630
Come on, guys. Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.

649
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:27,153
No, no, no, no. Don't do this, man.

650
00:37:27,618 --> 00:37:28,931
- S... stay with me. Stay with me.
- What happened?

651
00:37:29,536 --> 00:37:31,431
He... he... he let go of my hand.
He's gone limp.

652
00:37:31,528 --> 00:37:33,552
Rick! Wake up, Rick!

653
00:37:45,678 --> 00:37:46,302
Hey.

654
00:37:48,096 --> 00:37:49,960
I'm not gonna be able to make it
to your surgery.

655
00:37:51,928 --> 00:37:52,811
But here's the thing...

656
00:37:55,027 --> 00:37:57,013
You were crushed underneath
a cement pylon.

657
00:37:58,897 --> 00:38:01,191
Now dozens of people
on that ferry boat died.

658
00:38:02,587 --> 00:38:03,523
But you're still alive.

659
00:38:04,275 --> 00:38:07,721
So when I come back to check on you after
the surgery, you better still be alive.

660
00:38:09,105 --> 00:38:09,472
All right?

661
00:38:10,796 --> 00:38:11,541
You hear me?

662
00:38:12,946 --> 00:38:13,411
All right.

663
00:38:20,537 --> 00:38:22,860
Her B.P.'s stable. So is the baby's.

664
00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:26,880
You did good, Karev.

665
00:38:28,087 --> 00:38:29,052
Is she gonna be okay?

666
00:38:31,825 --> 00:38:32,500
You know, we're gonna...

667
00:38:33,485 --> 00:38:35,000
We're gonna do everything we can.

668
00:38:35,677 --> 00:38:38,493
What about the baby? I mean, is she
gonna be able to carry it to term?

669
00:38:39,806 --> 00:38:40,522
Um...

670
00:38:42,017 --> 00:38:43,443
You should get back down to the clinic.

671
00:38:58,367 --> 00:38:59,961
Look, Mrs. Heit, it's time.

672
00:39:00,025 --> 00:39:04,143
We really need to operate before you lose
any more blood or your bowels start to die.

673
00:39:05,348 --> 00:39:07,342
Just... wait...

674
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:10,672
Till Dr. O'Malley finds my son. Please.

675
00:39:19,387 --> 00:39:26,020
Dr. O'Malley... George... Did you find
him? Is...is he okay? Is he awake?

676
00:39:32,475 --> 00:39:34,721
One of his pupils is blown.
We don't have a lot of time.

677
00:39:34,778 --> 00:39:35,760
What are you gonna do?

678
00:39:35,986 --> 00:39:37,340
God, you can't let him die.

679
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,442
I'm sorry.

680
00:39:38,766 --> 00:39:39,983
I'm doing what I can.

681
00:39:40,018 --> 00:39:40,833
Well, it's not enough.

682
00:39:41,197 --> 00:39:41,983
Please just...

683
00:39:43,246 --> 00:39:45,102
Just look, they're not gonna get
him out of here any time soon.

684
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:47,901
So you gotta figure out a way to
help him right here, right now.

685
00:40:02,597 --> 00:40:03,482
Finally.

686
00:40:04,587 --> 00:40:06,951
- Kelly Winter.
- Fatima? Fatima's a little girl...

687
00:40:06,657 --> 00:40:07,442
Hold on. Hold on.

688
00:40:07,468 --> 00:40:09,421
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Dr. Karev.

689
00:40:09,696 --> 00:40:11,613
This is a very rough situation,

690
00:40:11,636 --> 00:40:14,011
and I can assure you,
we're doing everything that we can.

691
00:40:14,637 --> 00:40:18,020
The following are the patients
we've identified at this time... Okay,

692
00:40:18,518 --> 00:40:20,890
"John J. Anders, Kirk Demorast"...

693
00:40:21,477 --> 00:40:23,771
This is the same list they gave us
a half-hour ago.

694
00:40:23,927 --> 00:40:24,961
It's posted over there.

695
00:40:25,317 --> 00:40:26,312
I... I understand, but...

696
00:40:26,515 --> 00:40:29,580
Please, just, Kelly... She's got
brown hair. She's about 5'4".

697
00:40:29,745 --> 00:40:32,052
Look, we had a lot of people
who came in without I.D.

698
00:40:32,156 --> 00:40:34,683
Just take us over to the E.R.,
And we'll look for ourselves.

699
00:40:35,188 --> 00:40:36,613
We can't let you do that.

700
00:40:36,686 --> 00:40:39,142
- Why not?
- Those are our kids in there!

701
00:40:55,466 --> 00:40:57,102
Okay. Let's see.

702
00:40:57,256 --> 00:41:02,131
Now I have to deflate the blood pressure
cuff and see if he bleeds.

703
00:41:02,285 --> 00:41:02,730
Good.

704
00:41:04,058 --> 00:41:08,603
Okay. We saved him. You helped.
We just have to bandage him up,

705
00:41:08,695 --> 00:41:10,182
We're gonna find someone
to take him to the hospital,

706
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:11,670
and then we're gonna find your mom, okay?

707
00:41:17,805 --> 00:41:20,622
Aah! I can't stand it. The pain!

708
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,241
- I gotta get outta here!
- Sir, don't move! Don't move!
