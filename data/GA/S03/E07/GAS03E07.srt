1
00:00:00,185 --> 00:00:02,105
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,000
You understand there are rules
to your probation?

3
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:06,919
The divorce was finalized this morning.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,332
I think I need a little time to...

5
00:00:08,384 --> 00:00:10,209
- Take some space.
- Yeah.

6
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,070
The other night?

7
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:12,703
That was me breaking up with you.

8
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:14,042
I slept with another guy.

9
00:00:14,043 --> 00:00:15,795
It was not cheerful. It was dirty.

10
00:00:18,408 --> 00:00:20,940
- You told me your hand was fine.
- And it's not fine!

11
00:00:21,032 --> 00:00:21,848
Stop

12
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:24,254
- worrying.
- We are a well-oiled machine.

13
00:00:24,486 --> 00:00:25,673
Nobody has to know.

14
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:39,873
<i>As surgeons, we're trained
to look for disease.

15
00:00:40,015 --> 00:00:41,730
You're going camping?

16
00:00:41,837 --> 00:00:43,563
Uh, with Shepherd. Yes.

17
00:00:43,565 --> 00:00:47,320
With the sleeping on the ground and
everyone peeing behind the same bush?

18
00:00:47,328 --> 00:00:48,480
Fresh air.

19
00:00:48,487 --> 00:00:50,893
<i>Sometimes the problem's easily detected.

20
00:00:50,898 --> 00:00:53,410
We have back-to-back cabages.
I booked the O.R.s.

21
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:56,981
- I canceled the O.R.s.
- Why?

22
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:00,861
Because I'm going camping with Shepherd.

23
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:05,123
But why?

24
00:01:05,508 --> 00:01:08,552
Getting away, out of the city,
men being men.

25
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:11,592
- Mountain men in the wild.
- Ah, the open road.

26
00:01:11,596 --> 00:01:13,613
The road not taken.
The uncharted course.

27
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,801
Terra incognita.

28
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:16,052
Well, okay.

29
00:01:16,426 --> 00:01:19,332
<i>Most of the time,
you need to go step-by-step,

30
00:01:19,348 --> 00:01:23,103
<i>first probing the surface,
looking for any sign of trouble...

31
00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:24,582
We do have to make one stop.

32
00:01:27,457 --> 00:01:28,343
<i>A mole

33
00:01:28,358 --> 00:01:29,511
<i>or a lesion

34
00:01:29,517 --> 00:01:30,783
<i>or an unwelcome lump.

35
00:01:30,797 --> 00:01:32,441
- Mountain men in the wild!
- Yeah.

36
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:34,662
Terra incognita.

37
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:36,670
You know, this is my first camping trip.

38
00:01:36,677 --> 00:01:37,680
Oh, you don't say?

39
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:39,901
So, Preston...

40
00:01:39,908 --> 00:01:41,400
any other little surprises?

41
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,641
You have sunscreen
and insect repellant? Oh

42
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:45,141
and you're gonna need a shovel
to bury your poop.

43
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:47,231
Izzie, I'm not 5.
Zip me.

44
00:01:47,238 --> 00:01:49,102
And if Callie calls,
will you tell her...

45
00:01:49,678 --> 00:01:52,793
Tell her I'm a mountain man.
I'm a man on a mountain,

46
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,143
right, Dr. Burke?

47
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:56,212
Okay, him I invited.

48
00:01:56,585 --> 00:01:57,972
Izzie baked us treats.

49
00:01:59,308 --> 00:02:00,913
Have fun with your, um...

50
00:02:01,647 --> 00:02:02,601
space...

51
00:02:03,198 --> 00:02:04,180
or whatever.

52
00:02:06,348 --> 00:02:08,252
I just thought we needed an extra tent.

53
00:02:08,257 --> 00:02:10,123
Maybe Joe misunderstood?

54
00:02:10,127 --> 00:02:12,161
Hey, you want to follow us or
should we follow you?

55
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:14,100
This is unbelievable.

56
00:02:14,148 --> 00:02:15,383
Hey, guys.

57
00:02:15,475 --> 00:02:16,913
That wasn't me, I swear.

58
00:02:17,955 --> 00:02:19,313
What are you doing?

59
00:02:26,607 --> 00:02:28,010
<i>Most of the time,

60
00:02:28,207 --> 00:02:32,000
<i>we can't tell what's wrong
with somebody by just looking at them.

61
00:02:32,337 --> 00:02:33,442
<i>After all,

62
00:02:33,448 --> 00:02:36,240
<i>they can look perfectly fine on the outside

63
00:02:36,246 --> 00:02:40,370
<i>while their insides tell us a
whole other story.

64
00:03:08,806 --> 00:03:09,932
Derek's camping...

65
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:11,620
taking time,

66
00:03:11,635 --> 00:03:14,350
- getting space.
- Prestons do not go into the woods.

67
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:17,320
A guy named Preston is gonna get
his ass kicked by a squirrel.

68
00:03:17,617 --> 00:03:19,152
It's basically a slumber party.

69
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:21,690
They do it outside, we do it inside.
That's really the only difference.

70
00:03:22,086 --> 00:03:23,780
Have you seen what's his face?

71
00:03:24,328 --> 00:03:25,411
Alex Karev...

72
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:28,370
Poor bastard seems to get a thrill out of
tagging along after me.

73
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:29,653
He's camping.

74
00:03:29,887 --> 00:03:32,831
Well, in that case, how'd you like to get
a thrill out of tagging along after me?

75
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:36,283
- Dr. Bailey makes the assignments.
- Dr. Bailey says it's fine.

76
00:03:37,268 --> 00:03:38,112
Go.

77
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:43,192
Stevens, conference room.

78
00:03:43,198 --> 00:03:45,140
You're spending the day with
a peer counselor.

79
00:03:45,535 --> 00:03:48,243
Is that like a shrink? The hospital's
already making me see a shrink.

80
00:03:48,246 --> 00:03:50,602
Go... meet your peer,
get counseled.

81
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:53,672
Exciting procedures
on the board today, huh, Yang?

82
00:03:53,675 --> 00:03:55,940
Yes,  Dr. Bailey. Which one
would you like me to start with?

83
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:58,593
- Are those...
- Monopoly pieces,

84
00:03:58,596 --> 00:04:00,621
21 of them to be exact,

85
00:04:00,738 --> 00:04:02,533
mostly houses and hotels.

86
00:04:02,536 --> 00:04:05,710
I also swallowed the thimble,
the racecar, oh, and the shoe.

87
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:09,650
Eric and his older brother
don't always get along.

88
00:04:09,796 --> 00:04:12,060
He wouldn't let me play monopoly
with him and his friends.

89
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:13,241
This way nobody could play.

90
00:04:13,446 --> 00:04:15,263
Yang, what do you recommend?

91
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:17,002
- Is this even surgical?
- Yang.

92
00:04:19,546 --> 00:04:22,851
Track and inventory all the pieces,
measure the progress in x-rays,

93
00:04:23,987 --> 00:04:25,672
keep examining the stool.

94
00:04:25,677 --> 00:04:26,711
Very good.

95
00:04:27,457 --> 00:04:28,271
Enjoy.

96
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,723
Dr. Bailey, isn't this more
of a nurse's job?

97
00:04:33,327 --> 00:04:34,980
Are you too good to help that boy?

98
00:04:35,436 --> 00:04:36,562
Yes.

99
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:38,320
No.

100
00:04:38,688 --> 00:04:39,681
Definitely not.

101
00:04:39,686 --> 00:04:43,152
I-I just thought I'd be more help
if I was assisting you in a surgery.

102
00:04:43,276 --> 00:04:44,450
No surgeries for you.

103
00:04:45,336 --> 00:04:46,980
No, I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

104
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:49,623
I don't understand why you erased
my name from the O.R. Board.

105
00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:51,632
I'm... I don't know
what you're talking about.

106
00:04:51,638 --> 00:04:52,792
No, don't do that.
Don't

107
00:04:52,796 --> 00:04:55,500
give me that fake confused look.
It irritates me.

108
00:04:55,506 --> 00:04:57,492
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

109
00:04:57,496 --> 00:05:00,572
You erased my name
from Burke's humpty dumpty surgery.

110
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:03,580
I know it, and you know it.
What I don't know is why.

111
00:05:04,236 --> 00:05:04,971
I...

112
00:05:09,648 --> 00:05:10,930
have no comment.

113
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,493
No surgeries, Yang.

114
00:05:15,517 --> 00:05:16,963
Okay, before you start,

115
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:18,441
there are rules to this...

116
00:05:18,937 --> 00:05:20,571
friendship thing or whatever.

117
00:05:20,847 --> 00:05:23,202
The dirty mistresses club has rules?

118
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,433
Gosh, you'd think 
a bunch of dirty mistresses would

119
00:05:25,888 --> 00:05:28,232
be a little less uptight about
things like rules.

120
00:05:28,305 --> 00:05:29,610
Number one,

121
00:05:29,617 --> 00:05:31,572
no flirting.
Second,

122
00:05:31,578 --> 00:05:32,951
no talking about Derek.

123
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:33,783
"C"...

124
00:05:34,288 --> 00:05:35,722
no giving me the face.

125
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:38,811
The face?

126
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:40,170
The Mcsteamy face.

127
00:05:40,177 --> 00:05:41,993
It doesn't work on me.
I'm immune.

128
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:43,180
You  know,

129
00:05:43,197 --> 00:05:46,171
if I'd gone off to the woods,
I would have invited you to keep me warm.

130
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:51,720
Breaking rules one, two and three.

131
00:05:54,707 --> 00:05:55,490
Izzie!

132
00:05:55,578 --> 00:05:56,443
Sydney.

133
00:05:57,338 --> 00:05:59,070
- You're my counselor.
- Peer counselor.

134
00:05:59,176 --> 00:05:59,940
We're equals.

135
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:04,920
How are you?

136
00:06:05,496 --> 00:06:07,062
Fine. I'm fine.

137
00:06:07,345 --> 00:06:09,001
Now that is "outside Izzie" talking.

138
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:10,522
Okay?

139
00:06:11,378 --> 00:06:12,423
How's "inside Izzie"?

140
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:22,143
So...

141
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:23,421
you and Derek,

142
00:06:23,586 --> 00:06:24,891
you guys together or...

143
00:06:24,895 --> 00:06:27,360
just answer the question,
and I'll stop asking.

144
00:06:27,392 --> 00:06:29,968
Derek and I are taking some space.

145
00:06:30,121 --> 00:06:33,034
You're taking space from each other,
or he's taking some space from you?

146
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:35,333
Derek and I,
there's just a lot of water under the...

147
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:37,252
thing or something.
Whatever.

148
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:43,022
My knight in shining poly-cotton.

149
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,122
Morning, Donna.

150
00:06:44,175 --> 00:06:44,931
Vicky.

151
00:06:45,368 --> 00:06:46,201
How was the trip?

152
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,522
- Smooth, perfect.
- Speak for yourself.

153
00:06:49,727 --> 00:06:51,712
She's still having some penis issues.

154
00:06:52,626 --> 00:06:53,572
I'm sorry?

155
00:06:56,597 --> 00:06:57,952
Am I missing something?

156
00:06:58,425 --> 00:07:01,280
I believe you're missing the fact that
Dr. Sloan is planning to remove

157
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,420
my husband's penis this afternoon.

158
00:07:04,877 --> 00:07:05,870
Oh. Uh...

159
00:07:06,216 --> 00:07:07,490
and your husband is?

160
00:07:07,838 --> 00:07:08,733
Right here.

161
00:07:21,696 --> 00:07:23,551
Daniel Gibson, 34,

162
00:07:23,556 --> 00:07:26,432
in for sexual reassignment surgery,

163
00:07:26,436 --> 00:07:27,860
Donna, not Daniel.

164
00:07:27,895 --> 00:07:30,092
She's been living as Donna
for two years. Come on, Grey.

165
00:07:30,376 --> 00:07:33,551
So essentially today,
we are inverting his,

166
00:07:33,556 --> 00:07:35,381
uh, her, uh...

167
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:36,533
her penis.

168
00:07:37,115 --> 00:07:38,382
That's okay. You'll get it.

169
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:40,710
You know the steps for a vaginoplasty?

170
00:07:40,817 --> 00:07:41,961
Not exactly.

171
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,953
Well, if you want to get in on this operation
today, you better learn.

172
00:07:44,957 --> 00:07:46,780
Don't pay any attention to him.

173
00:07:46,785 --> 00:07:47,961
You' doing very well.

174
00:07:48,377 --> 00:07:50,301
Better than I did when I first found out.

175
00:07:50,468 --> 00:07:52,452
We just need to run a few pre-op labs,

176
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,980
make sure everything's in working order.

177
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:55,750
And then surgery... today?

178
00:07:56,348 --> 00:07:57,512
Yeah.

179
00:07:58,067 --> 00:07:59,711
Big day, Donna.

180
00:08:00,128 --> 00:08:00,963
You excited?

181
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:03,290
Excited doesn't begin to cover it.

182
00:08:06,956 --> 00:08:08,492
You're gonna do great.

183
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:33,583
That is a nice-looking picnic basket.

184
00:08:33,587 --> 00:08:36,393
Ah, thank you.
The concierge at the hotel put it together.

185
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,423
We got crackers, uh,

186
00:08:38,428 --> 00:08:41,650
pâté  and an assortment of
Seattle soft cheeses.

187
00:08:41,656 --> 00:08:43,210
- Do you like some?
- No, thanks.

188
00:08:43,896 --> 00:08:46,821
- Dude, he brought silverware.
- You should talk.

189
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:48,493
Have you ever been camping before?

190
00:08:48,865 --> 00:08:49,611
What?

191
00:08:49,615 --> 00:08:51,191
A t-shirt and sneakers?

192
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:52,410
You'll freeze your ass off.

193
00:08:52,415 --> 00:08:53,661
So? I'm wearing a jacket.

194
00:08:53,668 --> 00:08:54,763
Just do me a favor.

195
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:56,492
Don't come crawling to me
in the middle of the night

196
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:57,882
when you want to huddle for warmth.

197
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:03,290
That's a good-looking tent, Joe.

198
00:09:04,027 --> 00:09:07,500
Uh, you and Walter got room for one more?

199
00:09:10,337 --> 00:09:12,271
I thought you'd be sleeping
with one of the doctors.

200
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:17,550
Well, Preston's already got O'Malley
for a roommate, and, um...

201
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:20,260
just between you and me,

202
00:09:20,347 --> 00:09:22,623
those other tents are pretty puny.

203
00:09:22,765 --> 00:09:25,341
Well, Walter and I were sort of
wanting to share this one,

204
00:09:25,627 --> 00:09:27,061
just the two of us.

205
00:09:30,297 --> 00:09:31,622
But I guess if 

206
00:09:31,628 --> 00:09:32,742
you really want to...

207
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:35,522
Chief, I don't think you really...

208
00:09:35,855 --> 00:09:36,953
They've offered, Karev.

209
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:38,800
Chief,
they want to be alone.

210
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:48,571
So you are, um...

211
00:09:48,987 --> 00:09:49,700
Chief.

212
00:09:50,226 --> 00:09:51,163
That's wonderful.

213
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:52,813
Man love.

214
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,060
It's  beautiful.

215
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:57,103
M-my--my cousin's gay,

216
00:09:57,385 --> 00:09:59,300
So I'm, I'm hip.

217
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,331
"Brokeback mountain," and all of that.

218
00:10:02,908 --> 00:10:04,570
- Who's ready to go fishing?
- Uh, me.

219
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,231
- I'm ready.
- Okay, yeah. Let's go.

220
00:10:08,425 --> 00:10:09,540
Yes, fishing...

221
00:10:12,386 --> 00:10:13,780
Guess what I'm doing today.

222
00:10:13,788 --> 00:10:15,860
Removing a man's penis.

223
00:10:16,725 --> 00:10:18,321
You got an S.R.S.?
Seriously?

224
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,283
He's, uh... she, she,

225
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:22,870
- is one of Sloan's patients.
- Oh, god. That should be me.

226
00:10:23,258 --> 00:10:24,503
I should be turning

227
00:10:24,638 --> 00:10:27,220
a penis into a vagina.
That should be my penis.

228
00:10:27,565 --> 00:10:28,471
I have to hide.

229
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:29,973
Sydney

230
00:10:30,098 --> 00:10:31,472
is my peer counselor.

231
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,613
"Heal with love" Sydney.

232
00:10:36,305 --> 00:10:39,132
Yeah, I'm supposed to be shadowing her
and dialoguing all day,

233
00:10:39,136 --> 00:10:41,253
unless I can come up
with a good medical reason not to.

234
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:42,573
Anybody? Anything?

235
00:10:46,206 --> 00:10:47,552
Couple of houses and the dog.

236
00:10:47,996 --> 00:10:49,543
That's nine pieces so far.

237
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,282
I  love the dog.

238
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:53,283
I'm always the dog when I play monopoly.

239
00:10:58,786 --> 00:11:00,101
Uh, I got a page.

240
00:11:00,557 --> 00:11:04,213
Jamie Carr, she slipped and fell
in the shower this morning.

241
00:11:04,217 --> 00:11:06,592
I can't see my own feet.
I... did this.

242
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:08,301
Ooh,

243
00:11:08,427 --> 00:11:09,363
nasty break.

244
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:13,391
She hasn't had any meds for the pain?

245
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:14,923
She refused.

246
00:11:14,928 --> 00:11:15,982
She's toughing it out.

247
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:18,310
Oh, don't do that.
Don't tough it out. Just say yes.

248
00:11:18,315 --> 00:11:19,562
Well, the baby,

249
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,172
I know Dr. Montgomery said
it was all right. But,

250
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:25,192
I'll suffer.

251
00:11:26,906 --> 00:11:28,172
Is he okay? I...

252
00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:31,222
He was kicking like crazy,
and... and now...

253
00:11:31,227 --> 00:11:32,971
It's possible that he's just sleeping.

254
00:11:33,288 --> 00:11:34,020
So...

255
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:35,973
our son sleeps.

256
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:38,532
He's just sleeping, Jamie.

257
00:11:41,085 --> 00:11:42,303
Do I need a cast?

258
00:11:42,305 --> 00:11:43,210
Definitely.

259
00:11:43,405 --> 00:11:44,770
But first we need to straighten the bones.

260
00:11:45,325 --> 00:11:47,361
We'll just put your arm
in this kind of fancy sling,

261
00:11:47,368 --> 00:11:49,232
and use gravity to help realign the bones.

262
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:53,312
Could you excuse me just a moment?
I'll be... I've got a...

263
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:01,751
Trade you?

264
00:12:03,498 --> 00:12:04,333
Vicky.

265
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:06,620
Insurance forms.

266
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:09,410
Donna gets his surgeries,
and I do the forms.

267
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:10,621
Super fun.

268
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:14,262
Well, you seem to be handling this
remarkably well.

269
00:12:17,616 --> 00:12:18,661
Well, I left

270
00:12:18,725 --> 00:12:20,180
at first...

271
00:12:20,255 --> 00:12:21,610
when she...

272
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:23,702
when he told me.

273
00:12:26,115 --> 00:12:27,761
You plan a life together,
you know,

274
00:12:29,336 --> 00:12:30,261
kids, and

275
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,382
suddenly,
that's all out the window.

276
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:35,570
Suddenly your husband
is this other girl in your house

277
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:38,241
who's borrowing your
eyeliner and waxing her legs.

278
00:12:40,185 --> 00:12:41,421
But you came back.

279
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:43,852
Why?

280
00:12:44,117 --> 00:12:45,370
Honestly, right now

281
00:12:45,446 --> 00:12:46,982
I have no idea.

282
00:12:55,087 --> 00:12:57,063
I'm really gonna miss the penis.

283
00:13:06,977 --> 00:13:07,683
You okay?

284
00:13:08,296 --> 00:13:10,041
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm okay.
I'm good.

285
00:13:12,506 --> 00:13:14,190
Don't make me climb over this stall.

286
00:13:14,937 --> 00:13:17,540
I'll do it, but I'll be really pissed
'cause I don't know you that well.

287
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:22,733
You're not okay.

288
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,631
Oh, I don't know why...

289
00:13:28,786 --> 00:13:31,103
There's no reason that
this should affect me this much.

290
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:33,190
I'm used to this.
I am, but...

291
00:13:33,418 --> 00:13:34,422
Used to what?

292
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:36,840
That woman.

293
00:13:38,077 --> 00:13:39,512
Yesterday, she's

294
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:41,982
just as healthy as can be

295
00:13:41,997 --> 00:13:42,980
and today...

296
00:13:44,517 --> 00:13:46,392
today her baby's dead.

297
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,250
So, uh...

298
00:14:05,237 --> 00:14:06,622
how long you and

299
00:14:06,936 --> 00:14:08,221
Walter been together?

300
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:09,822
Ten years,

301
00:14:09,877 --> 00:14:11,603
on and off. But now,

302
00:14:12,088 --> 00:14:13,670
definitely on.

303
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,061
Thinking about kids.

304
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,232
That's a big step.

305
00:14:18,387 --> 00:14:19,772
You have kids?

306
00:14:21,376 --> 00:14:22,082
No.

307
00:14:22,915 --> 00:14:24,153
Oh, I work a lot.

308
00:14:26,026 --> 00:14:27,190
Adele and I, w-

309
00:14:29,095 --> 00:14:32,143
well, she always said she didn't want
to raise kids alone.

310
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:35,091
Walter says the same thing.

311
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:37,022
He does?

312
00:14:38,255 --> 00:14:40,080
Well, I'm always working at the bar.

313
00:14:40,107 --> 00:14:41,893
But what are you gonna do, right?

314
00:14:41,907 --> 00:14:44,540
If I'm not there, who's gonna run the place?

315
00:14:44,588 --> 00:14:45,750
Exactly.

316
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:47,720
But Walter...

317
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:50,731
if I have to make a change,
I'll do it.

318
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:53,143
I can't imagine my life without him,
you know?

319
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:02,043
Very nice, O'Malley.

320
00:15:04,215 --> 00:15:07,060
At least once a month,
my dad would take me and my brothers to

321
00:15:07,065 --> 00:15:07,921
white river.

322
00:15:07,926 --> 00:15:09,212
Well, your dad taught you well.

323
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:12,613
How are you and, uh,
Dr. Torres doing these days?

324
00:15:12,866 --> 00:15:13,803
Good.

325
00:15:13,808 --> 00:15:15,642
She doesn't know it yet,
but we are.

326
00:15:16,257 --> 00:15:17,491
Excellent, even.

327
00:15:18,628 --> 00:15:19,873
For a while, uh,

328
00:15:20,325 --> 00:15:23,132
she wanted, I don't know,
a certain level of commitment,

329
00:15:23,138 --> 00:15:24,083
and I just

330
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:25,232
didn't feel that.

331
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:28,390
I was re-
Now I am, though.

332
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:30,430
- So you're stepping up?
- I'm stepping up.

333
00:15:31,658 --> 00:15:32,710
You knew, right,

334
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,723
when it was the right time
with you and Cristina?

335
00:15:35,776 --> 00:15:36,630
Right.

336
00:15:41,557 --> 00:15:42,590
You okay?

337
00:15:43,215 --> 00:15:44,260
Absolutely.

338
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:46,851
- Because, uh...
- We're here to fish, remember?

339
00:15:48,057 --> 00:15:48,883
Right.

340
00:15:48,885 --> 00:15:50,830
I'm gonna see if I can get
a better bite downstream.

341
00:15:54,317 --> 00:15:55,210
Okay.

342
00:15:57,376 --> 00:15:58,822
I'm sorry, Donna.

343
00:15:58,906 --> 00:16:00,430
The labs don't lie.

344
00:16:00,498 --> 00:16:01,591
Breast cancer?

345
00:16:01,608 --> 00:16:02,671
I'm sorry.

346
00:16:02,848 --> 00:16:03,963
I'm really...

347
00:16:05,808 --> 00:16:09,222
The needle aspiration showed
abnormal cells in your breast tissue.

348
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,791
Rare, but it happens.

349
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:12,753
So,

350
00:16:12,757 --> 00:16:15,623
the hormones I've been taking
are essentially giving me cancer?

351
00:16:15,627 --> 00:16:16,412
Yes.

352
00:16:16,737 --> 00:16:18,880
That's why we need to stop
the hormone therapy

353
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:20,123
and start the treatment.

354
00:16:20,358 --> 00:16:21,980
Or the cancer will get worse.

355
00:16:26,835 --> 00:16:27,903
The operation? 

356
00:16:28,517 --> 00:16:30,182
There'd really be no point.

357
00:16:30,186 --> 00:16:32,830
Once we stop the hormones,
your breasts will shrink, your

358
00:16:32,987 --> 00:16:34,501
facial hair will grow back.

359
00:16:34,635 --> 00:16:36,192
She'll become a man again.

360
00:16:37,418 --> 00:16:38,372
What if I

361
00:16:38,576 --> 00:16:39,540
do the operation,

362
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:42,073
keep taking the hormones?
What, what happens then?

363
00:16:42,076 --> 00:16:46,541
Donna,  you really want to treat this now
while it's still in its early stages.

364
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:48,752
So if I keep taking the hormones...

365
00:16:48,948 --> 00:16:50,713
You'd be feeding the cancer.

366
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:53,450
I could die?

367
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:56,810
Are you saying if I become a woman,

368
00:16:57,915 --> 00:16:59,090
I could die?

369
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:10,353
They are a happy couple.

370
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:12,320
Look at them.

371
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:14,141
They love each other.

372
00:17:15,365 --> 00:17:16,873
They should have everything.

373
00:17:18,115 --> 00:17:20,013
Happy people should have...

374
00:17:21,196 --> 00:17:22,830
happy things happen to them.

375
00:17:25,717 --> 00:17:27,383
- I gotta go tell 'em.
- Wait.

376
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:31,631
The moment you tell them,
they won't be happy anymore.

377
00:17:32,655 --> 00:17:34,533
Give 'em a few more minutes.

378
00:17:35,575 --> 00:17:37,013
Let 'em be happy...

379
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:39,203
A few more minutes.

380
00:17:45,027 --> 00:17:47,270
So you're gettin' back with Callie?

381
00:17:47,278 --> 00:17:48,221
Yeah.

382
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:51,331
Trust me, man,
I don't think you really want to do that.

383
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,440
Really?

384
00:17:54,746 --> 00:17:55,702
Really.

385
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,593
I guess when I get back,
I'm gonna tell her that

386
00:18:00,868 --> 00:18:03,293
we shouldn't see each other anymore,
and then when she asks why,

387
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:04,373
I'm just gonna say,
"Well,

388
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:08,082
Alex Karev thinks our relationship
isn't such a good idea"

389
00:18:08,156 --> 00:18:09,913
You think that'll do the trick?

390
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:11,941
Fine. Suit yourself.

391
00:18:16,656 --> 00:18:18,032
This was my camping trip.

392
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:19,572
I was gonna come alone.

393
00:18:20,608 --> 00:18:21,881
So why did you invite me?

394
00:18:21,955 --> 00:18:22,800
Because...

395
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:23,971
it's a guy trip,

396
00:18:24,205 --> 00:18:25,121
you know?

397
00:18:25,757 --> 00:18:26,731
Mountain men.

398
00:18:30,197 --> 00:18:31,560
You don't have any friends,
do you?

399
00:18:31,697 --> 00:18:32,931
Of course I have friends.

400
00:18:33,985 --> 00:18:35,201
Guy friends?

401
00:18:35,468 --> 00:18:36,790
Yes.

402
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:41,820
I just need peace...

403
00:18:43,435 --> 00:18:44,413
space.

404
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,990
I have a right to space.

405
00:18:46,265 --> 00:18:47,923
And you go and invite half the hospital.

406
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,632
That's because I have guy friends.

407
00:18:58,086 --> 00:18:59,353
There you are.

408
00:18:59,668 --> 00:19:01,582
I have been looking all over.

409
00:19:01,588 --> 00:19:04,073
Oh, Dr. Yang needed some help
with this patient.

410
00:19:04,078 --> 00:19:05,222
She needed some help.

411
00:19:05,807 --> 00:19:06,863
Oh, well...

412
00:19:07,018 --> 00:19:08,682
patient care always comes first.

413
00:19:08,688 --> 00:19:09,382
So...

414
00:19:12,258 --> 00:19:13,180
Uh, what...

415
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:14,563
Oh, I'll just wait.

416
00:19:14,837 --> 00:19:16,420
- Wait?
- Yeah, for you to finish,

417
00:19:16,428 --> 00:19:17,642
and then we'll dialogue.

418
00:19:18,785 --> 00:19:19,653
Okay.

419
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:25,911
So...

420
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,930
what happens with Donna now?

421
00:19:28,547 --> 00:19:31,763
She goes back to being an unhappy man
who's stuck with a penis.

422
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:35,150
There are millions of us out there.

423
00:19:35,546 --> 00:19:38,523
- You're unhappy with your penis?
- I could be a lot less unhappy.

424
00:19:39,365 --> 00:19:40,821
Maybe it's for the best

425
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:43,083
that he's taking some space.
Maybe...

426
00:19:43,636 --> 00:19:45,500
you two aren't meant to be together.

427
00:19:46,036 --> 00:19:47,100
Look,

428
00:19:47,155 --> 00:19:48,031
Derek...

429
00:19:49,435 --> 00:19:51,562
on the outside,
he holds it all together, but

430
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:54,423
he's damaged goods,
Meredith.

431
00:19:54,425 --> 00:19:56,343
It's my fault.
I damaged him,

432
00:19:56,348 --> 00:19:57,780
maybe forever.

433
00:19:57,928 --> 00:20:00,073
You really want to drink
from a poisoned well?

434
00:20:01,406 --> 00:20:02,342
Dr. Sloan...

435
00:20:03,146 --> 00:20:04,440
you have to talk to her.

436
00:20:04,445 --> 00:20:06,690
Donna says she wants to go through
with the operation.

437
00:20:13,197 --> 00:20:15,701
Joe and Walter got tired of
not catching any fish.

438
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:17,361
They went for a hike.

439
00:20:18,575 --> 00:20:20,140
What do you make of that?

440
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:22,241
Joe and Walter?

441
00:20:22,246 --> 00:20:24,443
Oh, no, no, no.
Joe and Walter are great.

442
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,100
I mean that we haven't caught any fish.

443
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:27,271
Any theories?

444
00:20:27,276 --> 00:20:28,210
Just one.

445
00:20:28,505 --> 00:20:31,283
Fish generally don't like to go where
there's a lot of noise.

446
00:20:35,075 --> 00:20:36,650
You notice anything going on with Burke?

447
00:20:36,656 --> 00:20:39,363
- No.
- 'Cause before, I thought I saw...

448
00:20:40,017 --> 00:20:41,323
What are you doing?

449
00:20:41,636 --> 00:20:44,070
You don't use bait when you're casting.

450
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,052
It's gonna fall off
before it hits the water.

451
00:20:46,056 --> 00:20:48,320
Here. What are you...
Here, here, here, here, here.

452
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:50,553
- What you want to...
- She's sleeping with Sloan, dude.

453
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:51,940
- What?
- Callie.

454
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:53,230
She's sleeping with Sloan.

455
00:20:55,406 --> 00:20:56,543
No, she's not.

456
00:20:56,545 --> 00:20:58,223
Torres is doing Sloan.

457
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,050
You better take that back.

458
00:21:05,816 --> 00:21:09,133
Yeah, people chatting, laughing,
moving around, that sort of thing?

459
00:21:09,546 --> 00:21:12,292
That sort of thing let's the fish know
that they're not alone.

460
00:21:13,466 --> 00:21:15,641
- That's the theory.
- So I invited other people?

461
00:21:15,646 --> 00:21:16,551
I'm just saying,

462
00:21:16,605 --> 00:21:17,791
it's not a frat party.

463
00:21:18,328 --> 00:21:19,400
Take it back!

464
00:21:20,358 --> 00:21:21,840
Oh, for god's sake.

465
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:24,251
What are you guys doing?
Break it up!

466
00:21:24,257 --> 00:21:25,211
Break it up!

467
00:21:27,357 --> 00:21:28,850
I don't condone fighting.

468
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:32,461
I don't like fighting.
I think it is pointless and foolish.

469
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:37,001
But you two idiots seem determined
to beat the hell out of each other.

470
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:38,393
So if you're gonna do it,

471
00:21:38,395 --> 00:21:40,171
you're gonna do it by my rules.

472
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:42,692
- Rules?
- Yes, O'Malley, rules,

473
00:21:42,696 --> 00:21:44,503
to help you protect your hands

474
00:21:44,655 --> 00:21:46,681
so you don't do irreparable damage
to them...

475
00:21:46,685 --> 00:21:48,742
- You're dead.
- Damage that would end your careers

476
00:21:48,745 --> 00:21:50,212
before they even started.

477
00:21:50,486 --> 00:21:51,963
So with that in mind,

478
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:55,002
wee gonna do open-handed combat.

479
00:21:55,006 --> 00:21:57,782
- A slap fight?!
- Open-handed combat.

480
00:21:57,788 --> 00:21:59,622
- This is ridiculous.
- <i>There will be no scratching,</i>

481
00:21:59,637 --> 00:22:01,012
- <i>no biting.</i>
- Karev is gonna kill him.

482
00:22:01,015 --> 00:22:02,690
- Not necessarily.
- <i>No punching,</i>

483
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:06,071
<i>no kicking,</i>
no wrestling moves of any kind.

484
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,771
Now any questions?

485
00:22:07,857 --> 00:22:10,181
- That doesn't leave us with much.
- All right.

486
00:22:13,475 --> 00:22:15,632
- O'Malley's a scrapper.
- A scrapper?

487
00:22:16,265 --> 00:22:17,893
He's gonna destroy him.

488
00:22:18,097 --> 00:22:19,421
He's tougher than he looks.

489
00:22:19,528 --> 00:22:22,393
- Silent, but deadly.
- This is immature and stupid.

490
00:22:22,406 --> 00:22:25,020
- I think you'd agree with me.
- They're letting off some steam.

491
00:22:25,358 --> 00:22:27,042
This is why you don't have any guy friends.

492
00:22:27,227 --> 00:22:29,480
Yeah, this is why I should've come alone.

493
00:22:30,256 --> 00:22:31,512
Ready? Let's go.

494
00:22:32,396 --> 00:22:35,800
I've wanted this since I can remember.
I've waited forever. I'm not stopping now.

495
00:22:35,805 --> 00:22:36,743
Donna, listen to me...

496
00:22:36,747 --> 00:22:39,603
If you don't do the operation, I'm gonna go
to New York and find another doctor.

497
00:22:39,606 --> 00:22:41,923
You're gonna have a very hard time
finding a surgeon.

498
00:22:41,938 --> 00:22:44,780
- I'll find one.
- Donna, I'm trying to save your life.

499
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:46,681
As a man.

500
00:22:46,808 --> 00:22:49,000
I am not a man.

501
00:22:49,706 --> 00:22:52,211
I'll fight the cancer.
I'll just fight it as a woman.

502
00:22:52,216 --> 00:22:55,143
For god's sake, wake up, Daniel!

503
00:22:57,595 --> 00:22:59,273
My name is Donna.

504
00:23:03,017 --> 00:23:05,360
I'm not gonna stand by and
watch you kill yourself.

505
00:23:17,778 --> 00:23:19,252
I need Vicky to love me.

506
00:23:25,117 --> 00:23:26,412
But I need her to love...

507
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:27,713
me.

508
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:34,053
Oh, my god. Please,
tell me it's gonna stop hurting soon.

509
00:23:34,056 --> 00:23:35,713
You're almost done.

510
00:23:35,726 --> 00:23:39,101
When our son's 15, and he's yelling at you
that you never did anything for him,

511
00:23:39,105 --> 00:23:40,631
you can guilt him with the wrist.

512
00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:50,093
Ted, Jamie, I need to talk to you...

513
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:55,370
about the baby.

514
00:23:55,377 --> 00:23:56,823
Dr. Montgomery...

515
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:03,010
You have to say it.

516
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:06,482
I won't believe it unless you say it.

517
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,381
You have to say it.

518
00:24:23,718 --> 00:24:25,480
Thanks for this, Izzie.

519
00:24:25,486 --> 00:24:27,950
Thank you.
No good deed goes unpunished.

520
00:24:27,957 --> 00:24:29,772
"Good deed"?
You're making me dig through crap.

521
00:24:29,776 --> 00:24:32,122
It's not like I asked her
to spend the day with me.

522
00:24:36,256 --> 00:24:37,920
How's it goin' in there?
Any luck?

523
00:24:41,685 --> 00:24:44,700
Okay, I can't have that grinning puppet head
stare at me another second,

524
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:46,973
- so just go.
- Cristina.

525
00:24:47,107 --> 00:24:48,201
Hey, this is my crap.

526
00:24:48,338 --> 00:24:49,630
This is my crap.

527
00:24:49,637 --> 00:24:51,711
Bailey assigned me this crap.
You get Sydney.

528
00:24:51,715 --> 00:24:54,300
Fine. Come on, Sydney.
We can go.

529
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:55,571
Okeydokey, smokey.

530
00:25:06,935 --> 00:25:09,350
Man, I thought
my brother and I had problems,

531
00:25:09,356 --> 00:25:11,331
- but you two are morons.
- Okay, well,

532
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:14,980
swallowing monopoly pieces
wasn't exactly a genius move.

533
00:25:14,986 --> 00:25:16,683
You could've really hurt yourself.

534
00:25:16,687 --> 00:25:17,831
I didn't, did I?

535
00:25:18,028 --> 00:25:21,071
Now my mom's gonna make my brother
let me play all the monopoly I want.

536
00:25:21,075 --> 00:25:22,062
I get to play.

537
00:25:22,518 --> 00:25:24,132
It's all that matters,
getting to play.

538
00:25:24,135 --> 00:25:25,291
And that makes you smart?

539
00:25:25,295 --> 00:25:26,751
You're fishing through my poop.

540
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:28,592
How smart are you?

541
00:25:34,418 --> 00:25:36,091
- Take it back.
- Nothing to take back.

542
00:25:36,095 --> 00:25:38,093
That's right, Karev. Whatever it was,
don't take it back.

543
00:25:38,097 --> 00:25:39,620
You don't even know why
they're fighting.

544
00:25:40,286 --> 00:25:42,110
Arms up, O'Malley.
Don't drop your arms.

545
00:25:45,867 --> 00:25:48,802
Hey, hey, no wrestling. No wrestling.
Come on.

546
00:25:49,928 --> 00:25:52,402
- This is stupid.
- George is defending his honor.

547
00:25:52,655 --> 00:25:55,372
Karev said that, uh,
Sloan's been sleeping with Torres.

548
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:57,821
- He what?
- <i>O'Malley, arms up.</i>

549
00:26:13,345 --> 00:26:16,472
Next time,
we're not going camping with straight guys.

550
00:26:16,695 --> 00:26:18,393
Oh, watch... Oh, no. God.

551
00:26:24,077 --> 00:26:26,553
So, basically,you're getting paid
to look at penises all day.

552
00:26:26,555 --> 00:26:29,260
I'm studying for
Mcsteamy's reassignment surgery.

553
00:26:29,638 --> 00:26:32,461
- You like Mcsteamy.
- Yes.

554
00:26:32,468 --> 00:26:34,613
I mean, no.
No, not like that.

555
00:26:36,675 --> 00:26:37,580
Just...

556
00:26:37,978 --> 00:26:40,490
you know, he thinks I'm better off
without Derek's baggage.

557
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,030
Thinks there's too much history there.

558
00:26:42,546 --> 00:26:45,780
Maybe in his own sick, twisted way,
he's just trying to protect me.

559
00:26:47,237 --> 00:26:48,253
Protect you?

560
00:26:49,178 --> 00:26:50,180
Maybe.

561
00:26:53,948 --> 00:26:55,063
Hey, um...

562
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:59,883
When your mother was first diagnosed
with alzheimer's...

563
00:27:01,185 --> 00:27:02,620
Why didn't you tell anyone?

564
00:27:02,906 --> 00:27:04,463
She asked me not to.

565
00:27:04,597 --> 00:27:05,511
Why?

566
00:27:06,695 --> 00:27:08,541
So you think
it was right to keep her secret?

567
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:09,301
Yes.

568
00:27:09,766 --> 00:27:10,733
Why?

569
00:27:11,207 --> 00:27:13,671
Even if it meant you had to fish crap
out of a toilet all day

570
00:27:13,686 --> 00:27:15,390
and probably for years to come?

571
00:27:18,406 --> 00:27:20,270
Okay, rewind. Start at the beginning.

572
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,273
- Whose secret are you keeping?
- Oh, wait.

573
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:28,071
What the hell happened?

574
00:27:28,076 --> 00:27:31,210
- He was fine one minute, and then he just...
- Eric, lay down, okay?

575
00:27:35,108 --> 00:27:36,683
His abdomen is rigid.

576
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:39,593
There's blood in the vomit.
He's perfed. Page Bailey.

577
00:27:41,477 --> 00:27:43,880
There's a lot of blood,
but, uh, it didn't penetrate the galea.

578
00:27:43,887 --> 00:27:44,951
Is that a good thing?

579
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:47,000
Yeah, it means we don't have
to do deep stitches.

580
00:27:47,736 --> 00:27:49,323
You're using a fishing hook?

581
00:27:49,907 --> 00:27:53,623
Ah, don't worry. We sterilized it.
Also clipped off the barb.

582
00:27:53,787 --> 00:27:55,061
It's good as a needle.

583
00:27:55,856 --> 00:27:58,612
All right, wound's clean. Just keep
some pressure on there, will you, Chief?

584
00:27:58,615 --> 00:28:00,040
- Got it.
- Okay, we're gonna do some stitches now,

585
00:28:00,048 --> 00:28:01,943
- all right, Walter?
- Is it gonna hurt?

586
00:28:02,395 --> 00:28:03,361
Yes.

587
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:05,030
It's okay.

588
00:28:07,865 --> 00:28:09,481
Karev, you wanna sew him up?

589
00:28:09,485 --> 00:28:11,462
Oh, no. No. No, forget it.

590
00:28:11,467 --> 00:28:12,682
I want an attending.

591
00:28:12,938 --> 00:28:13,862
Thanks, dude.

592
00:28:13,867 --> 00:28:16,110
We're doing some kind of crazy Mac Gyver
surgery in the middle of the woods.

593
00:28:16,117 --> 00:28:17,813
I want what's best for my guy, okay?

594
00:28:17,815 --> 00:28:18,701
No offense.

595
00:28:24,045 --> 00:28:25,871
Don't worry.
Dr. Burke's really good at doing this.

596
00:28:29,016 --> 00:28:30,030
Well, you are, right?

597
00:28:33,016 --> 00:28:33,771
Right.

598
00:28:41,935 --> 00:28:43,562
There's still a little bleeding there.

599
00:28:45,295 --> 00:28:46,671
Hold on, Walter.

600
00:28:57,567 --> 00:28:58,523
You got it?

601
00:29:04,557 --> 00:29:06,320
I always have it.

602
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:18,142
You want something?

603
00:29:19,527 --> 00:29:21,872
He is my patient.
I've been with him all day.

604
00:29:23,775 --> 00:29:26,810
If there's any chance that I can get in
on this surgery, I'd really...

605
00:29:26,815 --> 00:29:28,550
Why'd you erase my name from the board?

606
00:29:31,177 --> 00:29:32,561
I don't know what you're talking about.

607
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:35,492
You really wanna go head-to-head with me
on this? You really want that?

608
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:36,632
Right now,

609
00:29:36,856 --> 00:29:38,670
this second, in this moment,

610
00:29:38,856 --> 00:29:40,853
you chose your own fate.

611
00:29:55,705 --> 00:29:56,910
So tell me about Denny.

612
00:29:59,745 --> 00:30:00,770
What?

613
00:30:01,277 --> 00:30:02,170
Yeah, it helps

614
00:30:03,037 --> 00:30:03,751
to, uh...

615
00:30:04,318 --> 00:30:05,781
to talk about what happened.

616
00:30:06,835 --> 00:30:09,211
- So as much as you can...
- Okay, we are done here.

617
00:30:09,216 --> 00:30:11,320
Izzie, really...

618
00:30:12,947 --> 00:30:14,691
- It helps to share.
- No.

619
00:30:14,887 --> 00:30:16,741
I don't want to share with you.

620
00:30:16,826 --> 00:30:18,431
Do you know what I've been doing all day?

621
00:30:18,438 --> 00:30:19,880
Sifting through feces.

622
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:22,893
I would rather sift through feces
than talk to you.

623
00:30:23,226 --> 00:30:25,013
And now you bring up Denny
like you want me to...

624
00:30:25,016 --> 00:30:26,543
to gossip with you.

625
00:30:26,815 --> 00:30:29,063
Well, I understand this.
This must be difficult.

626
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:30,661
You understand? Really?

627
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:32,553
What, you cut
someone's lvad wire?

628
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:34,270
You fell in love with a man
and he died?

629
00:30:34,408 --> 00:30:35,202
Well, no, but...

630
00:30:35,218 --> 00:30:37,313
Then how in the hell
could you possibly know?

631
00:30:42,837 --> 00:30:44,401
Grey,
what's our next step?

632
00:30:44,405 --> 00:30:47,751
Continue the primary incision of
the ventral side of the shaft.

633
00:30:50,397 --> 00:30:53,302
I am surprised you agreed to do the surgery.

634
00:30:55,137 --> 00:30:57,391
People don't come to me to fix
what's on the outside.

635
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,093
They come to me to fix what's on the inside.

636
00:30:59,097 --> 00:31:02,310
So, if that means giving someone
a straighter nose or

637
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,893
bigger breasts or...

638
00:31:04,397 --> 00:31:06,542
if that helps a person get by...

639
00:31:07,748 --> 00:31:09,030
I don't run.

640
00:31:09,037 --> 00:31:10,351
I don't hide.

641
00:31:10,358 --> 00:31:11,873
I don't take space.

642
00:31:21,936 --> 00:31:23,721
Well, don't look at me.
I didn't start it.

643
00:31:23,726 --> 00:31:24,833
Karev.

644
00:31:24,838 --> 00:31:26,762
What? I just came out here
to have some fun.

645
00:31:26,766 --> 00:31:29,153
Then the guy gets all over me
about what I'm wearing.

646
00:31:29,435 --> 00:31:32,243
- He just rubs me the wrong way.
- You're on a camping trip.

647
00:31:32,248 --> 00:31:34,651
You're supposed to be enjoying
the great outdoors.

648
00:31:35,716 --> 00:31:37,310
You know I grew up in a bar?

649
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:39,240
Literally in a bar.

650
00:31:40,217 --> 00:31:42,501
My dad was always doing
one of two things in there.

651
00:31:42,505 --> 00:31:44,192
Playing music or drinking.

652
00:31:44,838 --> 00:31:46,590
Dude never even took me to the park.

653
00:31:48,427 --> 00:31:50,782
I just figured this was my chance
to get out with the guys.

654
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:53,381
The one time I try...

655
00:31:53,385 --> 00:31:55,321
You wanted to be a different person.

656
00:31:59,566 --> 00:32:01,180
They're a happy couple.

657
00:32:01,276 --> 00:32:02,282
Yeah.

658
00:32:06,115 --> 00:32:07,601
I miss my wife.

659
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:12,823
You have high standards.

660
00:32:14,905 --> 00:32:17,940
- You have high standards.
- Your standards are too high.

661
00:32:19,756 --> 00:32:20,821
You...

662
00:32:21,086 --> 00:32:22,581
make people out to be...

663
00:32:23,837 --> 00:32:25,241
and people make mistakes.

664
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,881
Your standards are too high.

665
00:32:29,065 --> 00:32:31,013
You see a flaw, you attack.

666
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:34,413
Wait, wait.

667
00:32:35,366 --> 00:32:36,921
So you're saying that, uh,

668
00:32:37,435 --> 00:32:40,490
- if Cristina did something like...
- Cristina and I are a team.

669
00:32:41,966 --> 00:32:43,173
We are a team.

670
00:32:44,727 --> 00:32:46,023
You're either part of a team

671
00:32:46,028 --> 00:32:48,302
or you play alone for the rest of your life.

672
00:32:59,047 --> 00:33:00,532
good. Push, Jamie.

673
00:33:03,586 --> 00:33:04,632
Okay...

674
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:08,060
I need you to push one more time, Jamie.

675
00:33:08,385 --> 00:33:09,322
Ted.

676
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:12,680
One more time.

677
00:33:13,585 --> 00:33:14,502
Push.

678
00:33:16,335 --> 00:33:17,362
Push.

679
00:33:18,147 --> 00:33:20,003
Push. Good.

680
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:21,360
We got it.

681
00:34:10,585 --> 00:34:12,091
So that Mark Sloan...

682
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:14,202
He's bad news.

683
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:15,532
He's a cancer.

684
00:34:15,975 --> 00:34:17,220
He infects everything.

685
00:34:17,817 --> 00:34:19,840
What are we, three hours out of Seattle?
And still...

686
00:34:20,035 --> 00:34:21,330
he infects everything.

687
00:34:22,105 --> 00:34:24,541
You know, I thought if I just got away
for a while by myself,

688
00:34:25,588 --> 00:34:26,930
I'd get some answers,

689
00:34:27,105 --> 00:34:28,332
get a fresh start.

690
00:34:29,018 --> 00:34:30,160
Fresh starts...

691
00:34:30,748 --> 00:34:31,820
no such thing.

692
00:34:33,366 --> 00:34:35,231
Any other words of wisdom there, Chief?

693
00:34:37,266 --> 00:34:38,632
I'm living in a hotel.

694
00:34:38,825 --> 00:34:41,541
I buy most of my clothes from
the hotel gift shop,

695
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:43,431
and my wife won't speak to me.

696
00:34:44,017 --> 00:34:45,190
Oh, don't look at me.

697
00:34:45,257 --> 00:34:47,123
I came out here
for the same reasons you did.

698
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:48,873
I have no wisdom.

699
00:34:49,585 --> 00:34:51,230
There is no wisdom here.

700
00:34:51,866 --> 00:34:52,821
So

701
00:34:52,828 --> 00:34:54,212
in other words...

702
00:34:55,685 --> 00:34:57,153
we're all a bunch of idiots.

703
00:34:57,778 --> 00:34:59,101
Yes!

704
00:34:59,106 --> 00:35:00,732
Who wants to go home?

705
00:35:37,478 --> 00:35:38,660
I lost a kid...

706
00:35:39,706 --> 00:35:40,920
my first year.

707
00:35:41,565 --> 00:35:43,120
It was my fault.

708
00:35:43,816 --> 00:35:45,082
And I just couldn't...

709
00:35:47,987 --> 00:35:49,570
So I had a breakdown.

710
00:35:49,965 --> 00:35:53,033
They gave me time off, and when
I came back, I put a smile on my face,

711
00:35:53,255 --> 00:35:54,721
and everybody thought I was fine.

712
00:35:56,996 --> 00:35:58,410
I lost a kid.

713
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:02,402
It comes in waves, Izzie.

714
00:36:04,217 --> 00:36:05,603
There's a lull, and then...

715
00:36:06,318 --> 00:36:07,550
another wave hits you.

716
00:36:08,926 --> 00:36:10,321
I wasn't trying to pry.

717
00:36:10,516 --> 00:36:11,891
I just wanted you to know that...

718
00:36:12,505 --> 00:36:14,991
it's okay not to be fine s-sometimes.

719
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:18,851
I miss him.

720
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,682
All the time, I miss him.

721
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:24,720
It's not waves, it's constant,

722
00:36:25,407 --> 00:36:27,070
all the time.

723
00:36:28,385 --> 00:36:31,892
And I walk through the doors of
this hospital, and I want to be here,

724
00:36:32,117 --> 00:36:33,102
I do.

725
00:36:34,715 --> 00:36:35,483
But I...

726
00:36:37,096 --> 00:36:38,101
I don't know...

727
00:36:39,095 --> 00:36:41,381
if I can be a surgeon again,
and I can't talk about it

728
00:36:41,387 --> 00:36:43,043
because it scares me too much.

729
00:36:43,436 --> 00:36:44,421
Okay?

730
00:36:46,965 --> 00:36:47,970
Okay.

731
00:36:54,226 --> 00:36:55,510
You came back.

732
00:36:56,417 --> 00:36:57,872
I was heading home.

733
00:36:58,776 --> 00:37:00,812
I was on my way to the airport,
and then...

734
00:37:03,406 --> 00:37:06,202
You know, you asked before
why I came back the first time.

735
00:37:07,236 --> 00:37:08,640
You know, I tried not to.

736
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:11,972
I went on dates.

737
00:37:12,876 --> 00:37:15,353
I had a lot of great first dates with...

738
00:37:16,017 --> 00:37:18,031
guys who were planning to stay guys.

739
00:37:19,925 --> 00:37:21,613
But, you know,
you have a great date,

740
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:23,851
and you want to go and
tell your best friend about it.

741
00:37:26,616 --> 00:37:28,300
And my best friend is Daniel.

742
00:37:30,597 --> 00:37:31,633
Donna.

743
00:37:33,275 --> 00:37:34,391
And then you have

744
00:37:34,568 --> 00:37:36,151
a few bad dates, and...

745
00:37:39,646 --> 00:37:41,080
she's my best friend.

746
00:37:42,807 --> 00:37:43,870
She knows me.

747
00:37:44,287 --> 00:37:45,383
She loves me.

748
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,371
She's...

749
00:37:48,526 --> 00:37:49,752
my husband.

750
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,223
At the end of the day,

751
00:37:56,216 --> 00:37:57,341
it's Donna,

752
00:37:58,327 --> 00:37:59,561
even when she hurts me,

753
00:38:00,927 --> 00:38:02,251
even when I hate her.

754
00:38:05,495 --> 00:38:07,283
She's who you want to talk to.

755
00:38:11,548 --> 00:38:13,561
<i>Not all wounds are superficial.

756
00:38:16,885 --> 00:38:17,872
So...

757
00:38:19,187 --> 00:38:20,813
you're sleeping with Sloan.

758
00:38:22,897 --> 00:38:23,880
Was.

759
00:38:24,646 --> 00:38:26,052
Me, too. Was.

760
00:38:28,236 --> 00:38:32,553
Which is just a hailstorm
of self-loathing and misery.

761
00:38:33,726 --> 00:38:34,692
Yeah.

762
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:40,032
Hey, you want to, um...

763
00:38:41,977 --> 00:38:43,423
get a drink or something?

764
00:38:50,196 --> 00:38:51,793
Some other time then.

765
00:38:52,676 --> 00:38:53,810
Definitely.

766
00:38:58,528 --> 00:39:01,613
<i>Most wounds run deeper than
we can imagine.

767
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,702
He'll make a full recovery.

768
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:07,480
<i>You can't see them with the naked eye.

769
00:39:13,058 --> 00:39:14,023
You're back.

770
00:39:15,016 --> 00:39:15,900
Yes.

771
00:39:18,048 --> 00:39:19,310
I'm glad you're back.

772
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,233
Me, too.

773
00:39:28,588 --> 00:39:30,072
George, we need to talk.

774
00:39:30,598 --> 00:39:33,301
- Yeah, I think we do.
- It's about your dad, George.

775
00:39:33,677 --> 00:39:34,780
My dad?

776
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:36,140
<i>And then

777
00:39:36,146 --> 00:39:39,481
<i>there are the wounds that
take us by surprise.

778
00:39:45,226 --> 00:39:46,092
So...

779
00:39:46,807 --> 00:39:48,643
this could be just a drink,

780
00:39:49,168 --> 00:39:50,892
or this could be more than a drink.

781
00:39:50,897 --> 00:39:53,690
- I cannot start something with you.
- You could.

782
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,151
Start over, Meredith.

783
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:00,191
Start fresh.

784
00:40:06,408 --> 00:40:07,923
Saved by the bell.

785
00:40:14,185 --> 00:40:15,911
Order me another beer.

786
00:40:25,955 --> 00:40:26,941
Hi.

787
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:29,590
I'm Derek Shepherd.

788
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:33,413
What are you doing?

789
00:40:33,845 --> 00:40:35,561
Well, we met at this bar.
You remember?

790
00:40:36,915 --> 00:40:39,281
We met, and we,
well, you said, uh,

791
00:40:39,447 --> 00:40:41,613
"I'm just a girl"
I said, "I'm just a guy"

792
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:43,741
and we started this thing.

793
00:40:44,228 --> 00:40:45,592
We started this thing.

794
00:40:45,775 --> 00:40:47,211
You didn't know anything about me,

795
00:40:47,215 --> 00:40:49,211
the good, the bad, the wife.

796
00:40:50,525 --> 00:40:51,850
You didn't even know my name.

797
00:40:54,796 --> 00:40:55,800
You didn't know me.

798
00:40:57,628 --> 00:40:58,903
I want you to know me.

799
00:41:00,196 --> 00:41:01,290
I want to start over

800
00:41:01,298 --> 00:41:02,392
from the beginning.

801
00:41:05,157 --> 00:41:06,073
So, hi.

802
00:41:07,175 --> 00:41:08,091
Derek Shepherd.

803
00:41:11,387 --> 00:41:12,782
You walked away.

804
00:41:13,115 --> 00:41:14,641
And now it's too late.

805
00:41:14,648 --> 00:41:16,922
There's too much water under the thing

806
00:41:16,925 --> 00:41:18,571
- or whatever.
- Meredith...

807
00:41:23,056 --> 00:41:24,301
Please.

808
00:41:25,906 --> 00:41:28,481
<i>The trick with any kind of wound
