1
00:00:00,845 --> 00:00:02,601
Previously on "Grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,714 --> 00:00:04,432
You and Burke, are you okay ?

3
00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:05,878
We're existing in total silence.

4
00:00:05,949 --> 00:00:08,100
That hand is worth $2 million.

5
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:09,377
I want it fixed.

6
00:00:09,452 --> 00:00:11,574
Mark and I...
It wasn't a one-night stand.

7
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:12,513
I was in love with him.

8
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:13,678
At least, I thought I was.

9
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,636
Your sister Molly's just been admitted
for an emergency c-section.

10
00:00:16,658 --> 00:00:17,490
Molly's not my sister.

11
00:00:17,602 --> 00:00:19,308
She is. You have the same father.

12
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:21,404
Why didn't you stay and fight for us ?

13
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:23,763
I did. I... I tried.

14
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:25,103
Why didn't you try harder ?

15
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:27,243
You are officially off my service.

16
00:00:27,308 --> 00:00:29,543
But for what it's worth,
I think you're gonna miss me.

17
00:00:29,617 --> 00:00:32,691
Harold O'Malley, 63,
diagnosed with esophageal cancer

18
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,342
and severe aortic regurge.

19
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:37,072
You think I want to die
and leave my boy in charge ?

20
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:38,783
You are not gonna die.

21
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:56,032
Morning.

22
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,520
Are you watching me sleep ?

23
00:01:00,565 --> 00:01:01,193
Maybe.

24
00:01:01,486 --> 00:01:04,461
Are you some kind of weirdo
who watches women sleep ?

25
00:01:05,286 --> 00:01:05,971
Maybe.

26
00:01:15,996 --> 00:01:17,803
- Izzie.
- What ?

27
00:01:20,537 --> 00:01:23,390
I just dropped $8.7 million
on the floor.

28
00:01:24,948 --> 00:01:25,553
And ?

29
00:01:28,018 --> 00:01:31,670
I shouldn't be able to drop
$8.7 million on the floor.

30
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,103
You need to deposit that check.

31
00:01:38,077 --> 00:01:38,661
George...

32
00:01:39,388 --> 00:01:40,773
your father's surgery is tomorrow.

33
00:01:40,787 --> 00:01:44,273
Any chance you're misplacing
your anxiety on me and my check ?

34
00:01:44,555 --> 00:01:46,343
No, there is no chance.

35
00:01:46,747 --> 00:01:48,833
That check ruins my morning
every morning.

36
00:01:48,946 --> 00:01:50,203
It belongs in the bank.

37
00:01:50,316 --> 00:01:53,542
Would you just please...
as a favor to me...

38
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,610
would you just...
put it in the bank ? Please.

39
00:01:57,838 --> 00:01:59,732
Mm. No.

40
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:03,683
But... if you're nice to me
for the next seven minutes,

41
00:02:03,735 --> 00:02:06,313
I will give you a ride to work.

42
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:18,343
You don't deserve $8.7 million !

43
00:02:18,545 --> 00:02:21,341
Mm. So true. So true.

44
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,490
- How's Burke doing ?
- I don't know.

45
00:02:28,547 --> 00:02:29,190
She doesn't know.

46
00:02:29,256 --> 00:02:31,762
He just had surgery yesterday,
and you don't know how he's doing ?

47
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:32,841
They're not speaking.

48
00:02:32,947 --> 00:02:33,963
I thout they made up.

49
00:02:34,095 --> 00:02:37,411
- They did, sort of.
- But she's still nospeaking to him ?

50
00:02:37,437 --> 00:02:38,693
He's not speaking to me.

51
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:40,223
They're not speaking to each other.

52
00:02:40,276 --> 00:02:40,891
Okay.

53
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:42,973
Did you ask Derek about burke's hand ?

54
00:02:43,028 --> 00:02:44,660
I don't want to get in the middle of it.

55
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:47,700
Derek and I are happy. Could we
just keep it that way for while ?

56
00:02:47,787 --> 00:02:50,300
You know, you could always swallow your
pride and just ask him yourself.

57
00:02:50,358 --> 00:02:51,813
Her gut's not big enough for that.

58
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:53,600
Oh, Alex, you hurt me.

59
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:56,132
Oh, Georgie.

60
00:02:59,217 --> 00:03:01,221
Quiet down !

61
00:03:01,335 --> 00:03:04,883
Everyone, quiet down !

62
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:06,590
- Morning, everybody.
- Good morning.

63
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:09,443
- Uh, who's presenting ?
- Oh !

64
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:11,302
Oh ! Can Georgie do it ?
He's real good.

65
00:03:11,338 --> 00:03:13,762
Come on, Georgie. Yeah !

66
00:03:13,798 --> 00:03:14,883
Come on.
Come on.

67
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:19,852
Harold O'Malley, 63, status...

68
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:21,512
post-aortic valve replacement.

69
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:26,593
Morning chest x-ray showed no atelectasis
after aggressive C.P.T. for the last two days.

70
00:03:26,638 --> 00:03:30,553
Um, scheduled for a transhiatal
esophagectomy tomorrow morning at 9 :00.

71
00:03:32,827 --> 00:03:33,602
That's it.

72
00:03:41,018 --> 00:03:47,973
Um, for the next few minutes, I think it
would be best if the extended family
could wait out in the waitg area.

73
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:50,120
Just a few minutes, guys,
and then you can come back.

74
00:03:54,037 --> 00:03:55,610
How are you feeling, mr. O'Malley ?

75
00:03:55,658 --> 00:03:56,780
He's feeling great.

76
00:03:57,465 --> 00:03:58,632
"Better than ever," he said.

77
00:03:58,825 --> 00:04:00,463
Which is why we had everybody
come out today,

78
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:02,281
because we figured after today,

79
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:05,000
he maybe won't be feeling
so great for a while.

80
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:09,043
Uh, after the surgery, uh, then when
do we start chemo and stuff ?

81
00:04:09,108 --> 00:04:12,970
That protocol depends on what we find
when we open you up, Harold.

82
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:14,611
What  do you mean, what you find ?

83
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:16,420
Uh, Grey.

84
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:20,293
There's only so much they can tell
from labs and scans,

85
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,693
so they really need to get a good look
inside to see if the cancer has spread.

86
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:27,451
And if it's spread, that changes
how much chemo he needs ?

87
00:04:27,695 --> 00:04:28,683
That changes a lot

88
00:04:29,598 --> 00:04:30,541
Like what ?

89
00:04:32,996 --> 00:04:36,533
I'll let the oncologist explain
that to you later today, Harold.

90
00:04:36,746 --> 00:04:41,252
And dr. Grey will be taking you through
a final battery of preoperative
tests before we go.

91
00:04:41,305 --> 00:04:46,163
- So, um--
- So it would be best if the party went home.

92
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:56,841
Dr. Shepherd. Uh, dr. Burke's hand...
has he had any tremors ?

93
00:04:57,068 --> 00:04:58,000
That's confidential.

94
00:04:58,115 --> 00:04:59,670
Uh, but I'm... I'm one of his doctors.

95
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:01,883
You're also his girlfriend.
Ask him yourself.

96
00:05:02,675 --> 00:05:05,040
Good morning, everyone.
Who's presenting ? Morning.

97
00:05:05,158 --> 00:05:09,940
Preston Burke, post-op day one from I
and d of a compressive hematoma
to the brachial exus.

98
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:12,902
He is afebrile, and vital signs
were stable overnight.

99
00:05:13,088 --> 00:05:15,083
Incisions are clean with no signs
of infection.

100
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:17,040
Last morphine was given
at 2 :00 this morning.

101
00:05:17,248 --> 00:05:18,270
Ask about the hand.

102
00:05:19,757 --> 00:05:20,382
You ask.

103
00:05:20,485 --> 00:05:21,683
No, it's just one question.

104
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:23,953
Dr. Yang...

105
00:05:24,175 --> 00:05:25,920
Something you want to share
with the rest of us ?

106
00:05:29,526 --> 00:05:31,323
No, ma'am. Sorry.

107
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,430
Look good, Preston.

108
00:05:34,145 --> 00:05:37,440
- Take it easy on the nurses.
- I'll do my best.

109
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:42,770
- O'malley. Your father's surgery
is today ?
- Tomorrow.

110
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:57,771
- You okay, honey?
- Yeah.

111
00:05:58,498 --> 00:06:01,350
Can you just help me...

112
00:06:02,345 --> 00:06:03,463
Scoliosis ?

113
00:06:04,246 --> 00:06:07,171
- Looks like a birth defect.
- Looks like hell.

114
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:13,113
What are you all staring at ?

115
00:06:13,576 --> 00:06:17,822
Really, if you're expecting me to be the
brave and heartwarming differently-abled girl,

116
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,780
that isn't gonna happen,
so go ahead and do your thing.

117
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:25,180
Stevens.

118
00:06:28,215 --> 00:06:31,530
Heather Douglas, 17, past medical 
history of vater syndrome.

119
00:06:31,635 --> 00:06:32,551
Which is ?

120
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:39,243
Vater syndrome is a genetic condition
that affects the vertebrae, anus,
trachea, esophagus and renal system.

121
00:06:39,428 --> 00:06:41,183
Wow. Give this girl a medal.

122
00:06:41,385 --> 00:06:43,053
She memorized the whole acronym.

123
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,480
Which I assure you is a hell of a lot
easier than living with it.

124
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:48,071
Stevens.

125
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:49,840
Right. Um,

126
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:54,881
Heather is... is in today for a
lithotripsy to remove kidney stones

127
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:58,492
and a thoracoplasty to alleviate
pressure on her lungs.

128
00:06:58,777 --> 00:06:59,463
Can  I ask...

129
00:06:59,528 --> 00:07:01,693
I-I know I'm just supposed to
be here to remove a few ribs,

130
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:04,230
but I'm wondering if you've ever
tried anything more radical

131
00:07:04,706 --> 00:07:05,912
to treat the spinal curvature ?

132
00:07:06,348 --> 00:07:08,452
Let's see. If by "more radical,"

133
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:11,540
you mean having a steel rod
inserted into my spine,

134
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:13,262
then, yeah, we've tried.

135
00:07:13,655 --> 00:07:15,083
The rod just bent.

136
00:07:16,238 --> 00:07:20,413
Removing the kidney stones may
seem minor, but it will really improve
your quality of life.

137
00:07:20,616 --> 00:07:23,803
Really ? So this surgery
is gonna get me laid ?

138
00:07:24,035 --> 00:07:25,391
Heather, stop it.

139
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:29,771
Mom, I'm sorry, but she's talking about
improving my quality of life,

140
00:07:30,147 --> 00:07:33,601
and I don't think doctors should make
promises they can't keep.

141
00:07:37,377 --> 00:07:42,273
Laura Grey-Thompson, born four days ago
with jejunal atresia.

142
00:07:42,466 --> 00:07:45,180
Corrected surgically. Uh, post-op course--

143
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,840
Oh, I'm--I'm sorry. Am I interrupting ?

144
00:07:47,912 --> 00:07:52,218
Her mom and grandma ha-have the flu,
and they asked me to get an update.

145
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:55,824
Oh, she's doing very well, mr. Grey.
We'll be out of here in just a minute.

146
00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:01,043
- Dr. Grey, you were saying ?
- Um...

147
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:06,981
Excuse me, uh...
I'll just come back a little later.

148
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:16,521
- Grey ?
- Um...

149
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:22,703
Laura Grey-Thompson, had some dilation
of the bowels on x-ray this morning.

150
00:08:22,876 --> 00:08:27,173
We need to do a barium enema to make
sure there's no intestinal stricture.

151
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:39,022
Dr. Grey, I'd like you to stick
with mr. O'Malley this week.

152
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:44,100
Yang, pit. Karev, Sloan. Stevens,
prep Heather Douglas for surgery.

153
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:45,463
- O'Malley.
- Yes.

154
00:08:45,517 --> 00:08:47,421
- You're taking the rest of this week off ?
- Yes, ma'am.

155
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:50,561
- May as well take today, too,
spend some time with your family.
- Thank you.

156
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:54,331
Uh, dr. Bailey, as things progress
with my dad,

157
00:08:54,946 --> 00:08:58,043
you know, sometimes we--
with families-- we coddle them,

158
00:08:58,518 --> 00:09:01,760
sugarcoat things. It would help me if you
were straight with me as things progress.

159
00:09:02,597 --> 00:09:04,810
- Okay.
- Thank you.

160
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:08,041
Uh, dr. Bailey. Dr. Bailey.

161
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:12,030
I know that I'm supposed to prep
her only, but any chance I can
scrub in on Heather Douglas ?

162
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,552
- I mean, a vater patient isn't
something you see very often.
- No.

163
00:09:14,908 --> 00:09:15,770
But I'm ready.

164
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:17,443
I am ready.

165
00:09:17,837 --> 00:09:19,991
Your psychiatrist has not
given you an all clear.

166
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:24,242
He's... I have done everything
he has asked me to do, everything,

167
00:09:25,336 --> 00:09:27,370
except deposit my inheritance check,
which...

168
00:09:27,388 --> 00:09:31,191
Wait, you have not deposited
a nearly $9-million check yet ?

169
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,261
It... it's...

170
00:09:32,808 --> 00:09:34,433
He is being unreasonable.

171
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:36,300
That check has nothing to do with any...

172
00:09:36,148 --> 00:09:40,142
What's unreasonable is that you're losing
thousands of dollars a day in interest.

173
00:09:40,186 --> 00:09:43,003
That's unreasonable. You clearly
are not reasonable yet,

174
00:09:43,385 --> 00:09:46,482
which, I think, is the point your
psychiatrist is trying to make.

175
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:51,723
- Hey, I need C.B.C. and a chem-7
on Harold O'Malley.

176
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,870
I need these labs asap.

177
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,210
Everybody needs everything "asap."

178
00:09:55,378 --> 00:10:00,670
Oh, yes. And all throughout this
hospital, people are dying while
you give me crap about "asap."

179
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:07,522
- Hey, are you okay ?
- Why wouldn't I be ?

180
00:10:08,147 --> 00:10:11,353
Your father? Freezing up on rounds...
Oh, God. That was mortifying.

181
00:10:11,638 --> 00:10:16,033
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Oh, okay. It wasn't mortifying ?

182
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:21,590
I just wish the baby would get well and
go home and Thatcher would go with her.

183
00:10:22,116 --> 00:10:23,230
Is that wrong ?

184
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:27,440
Oh, wrong would be, if you wished
the baby wouldn't get well.

185
00:10:27,798 --> 00:10:30,001
Okay, good. Thanks.

186
00:10:30,318 --> 00:10:35,812
You  know, if you want to thank me, you
could ask Derek if Burke has had any tremors.

187
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:39,573
- Talk to him.
- No.'Cause then he wins.

188
00:10:39,816 --> 00:10:40,541
Wins what ?

189
00:10:44,848 --> 00:10:45,812
Forget it.

190
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:49,952
Do you have a father ?

191
00:10:52,196 --> 00:10:54,520
I have a stepfather.

192
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:57,403
He's nice. I see him for yom kippur.

193
00:11:01,836 --> 00:11:04,462
Karev, what did I tell you
about how I like my charts ?

194
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:07,170
I like to round on pre-op
before post-op.

195
00:11:07,245 --> 00:11:09,581
Do you like wasting my time ?
Is it fun for you ?

196
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:10,421
No, sir.

197
00:11:10,517 --> 00:11:11,392
Then get it right.

198
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:14,963
Do you like abusing the interns ?
Is it fun for you ?

199
00:11:15,016 --> 00:11:16,300
Yes, it is,

200
00:11:16,436 --> 00:11:20,092
and in case you've forgotten, you don't
get the high horse this week, Addison.

201
00:11:20,216 --> 00:11:21,451
Not this week.

202
00:11:23,286 --> 00:11:24,930
He's an ass.

203
00:11:26,795 --> 00:11:29,450
Not this week.

204
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:31,870
You know Shepherd pretty well, yeah ?

205
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:35,731
Lots of hair, too many women, likes 
elevators and long walks on the beach.

206
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:37,752
So, um, what's the best way
to get him to do something ?

207
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:38,801
What kind of something?

208
00:11:39,026 --> 00:11:41,531
A consult that the patient
hasn't requested

209
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,002
but that the friendly neighborhood ortho
resident thinks is worth pursuing.

210
00:11:44,057 --> 00:11:47,931
Shepherd thinks he's busier and maybe a little
bit more important than everyone else.

211
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:49,430
Standard neurosurgeon breed.

212
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,303
- Exactly.
- Okay, so ?

213
00:11:51,346 --> 00:11:54,263
So he'll say no
until you stare him down.

214
00:11:54,387 --> 00:11:55,242
"Stare  him down"?

215
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:58,323
Stare him down.

216
00:12:12,676 --> 00:12:15,930
- You're way too hot to be a doctor.
- Okay.

217
00:12:18,318 --> 00:12:21,842
I mean, aren't people who look like you
supposed to be dumb ?

218
00:12:24,506 --> 00:12:27,013
I'm just saying, you're not gonna
be in my surgery, are you?

219
00:12:27,118 --> 00:12:28,912
'Cause I'm a little too young to die.

220
00:12:29,726 --> 00:12:31,903
I will not be in on your surgery.

221
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:35,590
See ? I knew it.
You're not even a doctor.

222
00:12:35,717 --> 00:12:39,042
I am a doctor. It's just that when my...

223
00:12:39,605 --> 00:12:45,581
fiancé dropped dead not too long ago,
I went a little nuts, and, uh,
no surgeries for me for a while.

224
00:12:49,847 --> 00:12:53,681
Well, so much for my theory that life
doesn't suck for pretty people.

225
00:12:57,055 --> 00:12:59,430
I'm sorry I was such a bitch to you.

226
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:04,613
Well... you're in pain. Sometimes I'm
a bitch for no good reason at all.

227
00:13:09,827 --> 00:13:10,893
- Oh, dr. Shepherd.
- Yes.

228
00:13:10,907 --> 00:13:12,812
I am so sorry to bother you.
I know you're very, very busy,

229
00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:15,940
but there's a girl here. She's 17 years old
with severe scoliosis from vater syndrome.

230
00:13:15,957 --> 00:13:18,821
She's here for thoracoplasty because
her ribs are pressing against her lungs,

231
00:13:18,825 --> 00:13:22,283
and she's already had two spinal fusions
and a segmental spinal instrumentation

232
00:13:22,316 --> 00:13:25,393
that didn't work. She's bent over
at 9 degrees, which clearly sucks.

233
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:28,223
"Clearly sucks," is that
your professional assessment ?

234
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:33,012
My professional assessment
is that we can help her.

235
00:13:33,836 --> 00:13:35,631
My day is impossible.

236
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:44,232
I'll come by for a csult
in the morning.

237
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:50,083
I'm  a good starer.

238
00:13:56,558 --> 00:13:59,353
Doctors, could I get a word ?

239
00:13:59,486 --> 00:14:02,812
- Oh, how are you feeling, Harold ?
- Feelin' great. Feelin' fine.

240
00:14:02,928 --> 00:14:05,490
It's just that the oncologist...

241
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:11,821
he said that, uh, if the cancer
is in other organs,

242
00:14:12,297 --> 00:14:15,153
he said that maybe you wouldn't
proceed with the surgery.

243
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:16,261
That's right, Harold.

244
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:21,601
If the cancer's spread to your other
organs, it would compromise your
ability to recover from the surgery.

245
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:25,221
So if you close me up and then send
me home, I get, what,

246
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,071
a couple of weeks to live ?

247
00:14:27,415 --> 00:14:31,423
- You'd have... weeks or months, yes.
- No

248
00:14:32,465 --> 00:14:37,521
No, you gotta take the tumor out,'cause I can survive this. I know I can.

249
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,732
O'Malleys, we're figers.

250
00:14:39,826 --> 00:14:43,371
Mr. O'Malley, it... it's just not
a good idea to...

251
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:43,830
You know, my wife...

252
00:14:45,896 --> 00:14:49,931
We've been married 40 years.
I make her crazy, but...

253
00:14:50,896 --> 00:14:54,662
40 years. She needs me.
My family needs me.

254
00:14:55,378 --> 00:14:59,393
I can't let you close me up and then
tell them that there's nothing that can
be done when I know I can fight it.

255
00:15:00,306 --> 00:15:01,641
So I...

256
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:04,173
I'm asking for your word.

257
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:08,000
I want you to take the tumor out.

258
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:10,862
Mr. O'Malley, my job

259
00:15:11,957 --> 00:15:14,191
is to do the best I can for you
medically. After...

260
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:18,151
well, closing me up and sending me home
to die isn't best for me,

261
00:15:20,508 --> 00:15:24,203
not medically or any other way.

262
00:15:24,818 --> 00:15:30,412
Please... Take the tumor out.

263
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:38,293
All right.

264
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,723
All right ?

265
00:15:55,698 --> 00:15:58,400
This falls under confidentiality ?

266
00:15:58,837 --> 00:16:01,972
If you're asking if you can
tell his son, the answer's no.

267
00:16:18,307 --> 00:16:20,123
- You're watching me sleep again ?

268
00:16:20,196 --> 00:16:22,450
You're cute when you sleep.
What can I say ?

269
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:26,310
Yeah, but don't you sleep ?
Why are you always up before the alarm ?

270
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:29,182
I'm a light sleeper. It's no big deal.

271
00:16:29,535 --> 00:16:31,003
So something woke you up.

272
00:16:31,247 --> 00:16:32,662
It's no big deal.

273
00:16:36,506 --> 00:16:37,660
It's just that...

274
00:16:38,727 --> 00:16:40,453
- You snore a little.
- What ?

275
00:16:40,777 --> 00:16:43,682
- I do not.
- Yes, you do. I love it.

276
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:46,950
I find it charming that such a big noise
can come from such a little person.

277
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:50,660
- Do you know what's not charming ?
- What ?
- Your morning breath.

278
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:54,271
I'm sorry. What?

279
00:16:54,758 --> 00:16:59,710
I'm just saying, seeing how you're
always up before me, you might
consider brushing your teeth.

280
00:17:00,805 --> 00:17:02,203
Okay, this is me brushing my teeth.

281
00:17:03,827 --> 00:17:04,553
Thank you.

282
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:11,551
- Surgery's today ?
- Yeah.

283
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:14,540
- I'm okay.
- Yeah. I have a really good feeling.

284
00:17:15,197 --> 00:17:16,581
- Yeah ?
- Yeah.

285
00:17:17,187 --> 00:17:20,543
- I didn't even bake anything for you.
- Thank you.

286
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:35,142
Aha. Bone dry cappuccino.

287
00:17:35,325 --> 00:17:38,441
At least something's dry around here.
Does it ever stop raining in this hellhole ?

288
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,313
Not really.

289
00:17:39,588 --> 00:17:40,650
Great. Good to know.

290
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,821
What the hell is this, Karev, vanilla ?

291
00:17:44,238 --> 00:17:47,282
Are you trying to poison me or are you just
trying to make my day a little bit worse ?

292
00:17:47,348 --> 00:17:47,632
Mark.

293
00:17:48,216 --> 00:17:49,420
Coffee cart must have screwed up.

294
00:17:49,465 --> 00:17:52,120
You know, if you can't handle coffee,
you can't handle plastics.

295
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:55,651
Maybe you oughta head back to the gynie
squad where life was all squishy and pink.

296
00:17:58,688 --> 00:18:00,692
Squishy and pink

297
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:05,043
though it may be, I have an amazing
surgery today, Karev, if you want in.

298
00:18:10,127 --> 00:18:11,813
Good morning, dr. Burke.

299
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:15,100
Yes, it is.

300
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:17,700
Beautiful morning.

301
00:18:18,376 --> 00:18:20,343
I love watching the rain.

302
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:22,983
Feeling good ?
Not too much pain ?

303
00:18:23,795 --> 00:18:25,492
Feeling great.

304
00:18:26,656 --> 00:18:33,542
And... your hand... your right hand...
Feelin' good today ?

305
00:18:36,998 --> 00:18:42,682
I'm sorry, Olivia, you're just you're
gonna have to tell dr. Yang that I'm
not ready to give her that information.

306
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:48,501
Right. Okay, then. Sorry.

307
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:56,793
uh-huh. Uh-huh.

308
00:18:57,118 --> 00:18:58,692
You know Cristina's stalking your room ?

309
00:18:58,895 --> 00:18:59,750
I do.

310
00:19:01,117 --> 00:19:01,973
Your father ?

311
00:19:02,056 --> 00:19:05,130
Yeah. The surgery my dad's having...

312
00:19:05,898 --> 00:19:08,842
has a 50% morbidity rate.

313
00:19:09,108 --> 00:19:12,223
Oh, O'Malley... that statistic,

314
00:19:12,438 --> 00:19:15,693
it means 50% of the people who undergo
the surgery survive.

315
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:21,540
If you're gonna hang your hat on statistics,
then you have to look at them from both sides.

316
00:19:23,176 --> 00:19:24,940
Heather, I've looked
at your case history,

317
00:19:25,058 --> 00:19:28,622
and I know you've been through a lot of very
painful and very unsuccessful surgeries,

318
00:19:28,828 --> 00:19:32,200
but if you're up for it, I think I could
significantly help with the spinal curvature.

319
00:19:32,586 --> 00:19:34,800
By "help," you mean what, exactly ?

320
00:19:34,938 --> 00:19:37,291
I mean, I think I can get you
standing up straight.

321
00:19:37,618 --> 00:19:39,221
Are you messing with me ?

322
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:41,990
'Cause it's not nice
to mock crippled kids.

323
00:19:42,327 --> 00:19:45,081
You see this...
This curved part here ?

324
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,280
I'd remove it.

325
00:19:47,406 --> 00:19:50,542
You... You want to remove a portion
of my daughter's spine ?

326
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:51,350
And I would replace it with a titanium
mesh cage that would fill in the space
between the vertebra.

327
00:19:56,255 --> 00:19:58,861
I've seen case studies.
There have been quite a few successes.

328
00:19:59,035 --> 00:20:01,850
And... And the ones
that aren't successful ?

329
00:20:02,697 --> 00:20:06,642
They result in paralysis or death.

330
00:20:06,877 --> 00:20:09,112
But dr. Shepherd is the best there is.

331
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,201
- She's 17.
- Mom,

332
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:16,903
I know you still think death is the
worst thing that can happen to a person.

333
00:20:17,997 --> 00:20:21,691
Death is not the worst thing.

334
00:20:23,546 --> 00:20:24,312
I'm in.

335
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:29,890
They're gonna cut out a piece of
her spine... Heather Douglas.

336
00:20:30,317 --> 00:20:33,372
Doctors Shepherd and Torres, they're...
They're gonna straighten her spine.

337
00:20:33,528 --> 00:20:34,022
And ?

338
00:20:34,536 --> 00:20:37,511
And...
It's a once-in-a-lifetime surgery.

339
00:20:38,116 --> 00:20:43,832
Please. She's my patient. I've gotten to
know her. I would really like to scrub in.

340
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,703
- Did you deposit the check ?
- It's my money.

341
00:20:46,176 --> 00:20:47,613
I should get to do what I want with it.

342
00:20:47,877 --> 00:20:51,153
Uh, you get a 5% return on 6-month cd ?

343
00:20:53,407 --> 00:20:56,712
In the time we've been standing here,
you could've just made $400.

344
00:20:56,737 --> 00:20:57,573
Dr. Bailey.

345
00:20:58,047 --> 00:21:00,362
It's not reasonable, Stevens.

346
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,280
Dad, it's your discard.

347
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:09,713
I'm sorry about running over bucky.

348
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:11,120
- What ?
- Your dog.

349
00:21:11,387 --> 00:21:12,711
That yappy dog bucky.

350
00:21:13,236 --> 00:21:14,280
When you were a kid,

351
00:21:14,657 --> 00:21:18,713
I ran over him, and I told you he ran
away. I'm sorry about that.

352
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:21,523
- You ran over my dog on purpose ?
- Of course not.

353
00:21:21,618 --> 00:21:25,083
He was chasing after the truck like always
and he got caught up under the tire.

354
00:21:26,825 --> 00:21:31,242
You were so sensitive. You were such
a soft kid, I couldn't bear to tell ya.

355
00:21:31,378 --> 00:21:32,462
I wasn't soft. 

356
00:21:33,435 --> 00:21:35,672
I mean it good, Georgie.

357
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:40,302
You were kind and you loved animals.
You were always looking to help people.

358
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:44,872
And I couldn't face you and tell you
that I killed your dog so...

359
00:21:45,557 --> 00:21:47,470
I told you a lie.

360
00:21:48,137 --> 00:21:50,413
I'm saying I'm sorry.

361
00:21:51,027 --> 00:21:52,081
Okay.

362
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,053
You're a good kid, Georgie.

363
00:21:56,805 --> 00:22:00,153
Always  been
such a good kid.

364
00:22:02,175 --> 00:22:03,372
I want to tell you--

365
00:22:03,168 --> 00:22:05,563
Dad, stop acting like you're dying.

366
00:22:05,885 --> 00:22:07,123
You're not dying, okay ?

367
00:22:09,437 --> 00:22:14,180
I want to tell you that I think you're
crazy if you let that Callie get away.

368
00:22:14,308 --> 00:22:16,792
- Dad, please !
- No, she gets you.

369
00:22:17,218 --> 00:22:22,031
She gets you in a way that your
family never has. I'm sorry about that,

370
00:22:22,537 --> 00:22:26,601
That you grew up feeling
so different all the time.

371
00:22:27,106 --> 00:22:30,822
- That's another thing I'm sorry about.
- Dad, stop it.

372
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:34,611
Stop apologizing, stop saying good-bye.
You can't...

373
00:22:35,475 --> 00:22:37,281
that's no way to go into surgery.

374
00:22:39,196 --> 00:22:42,892
I'm gonna die someday, Georgie.
We're all gonna die,

375
00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:48,860
and lying here in this bed gives me
time to think about all the things
I haven't said is all.

376
00:22:48,957 --> 00:22:49,480
Okay.

377
00:22:51,145 --> 00:22:52,621
Well, just discard.

378
00:22:52,948 --> 00:22:54,791
- Anything you want to say to me ?
- Dad !

379
00:22:57,277 --> 00:22:59,312
I'm discarding.

380
00:23:02,778 --> 00:23:03,590
Dog murderer

381
00:23:09,115 --> 00:23:10,871
Tell me what I wanna hear.

382
00:23:10,907 --> 00:23:12,513
If I die, you'll kill me.

383
00:23:12,906 --> 00:23:13,890
He's a quick study.

384
00:23:15,947 --> 00:23:17,473
Meredith. Hello.

385
00:23:18,395 --> 00:23:19,890
- Hello.
- I'm...

386
00:23:20,336 --> 00:23:22,562
- Uh, how are you ?
- Good.

387
00:23:22,758 --> 00:23:25,350
Uh, busy with work.
We have a patient.

388
00:23:25,728 --> 00:23:27,172
- Hello.
- Hello.

389
00:23:27,535 --> 00:23:28,691
- Hi.
- Hi.

390
00:23:28,795 --> 00:23:30,441
- Hi.
- Hi.

391
00:23:32,948 --> 00:23:34,803
Uh, all right, then.

392
00:23:36,618 --> 00:23:40,023
- Oh, I'm so... Uh, nice seeing you.
- Okay.

393
00:23:43,835 --> 00:23:45,232
That your ex-boyfriend.

394
00:23:45,296 --> 00:23:46,950
No, that's my ex-father.

395
00:23:49,618 --> 00:23:50,822
You see, Grey ?

396
00:23:52,338 --> 00:23:55,513
Good exposure to the esophageal hiatus.

397
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:56,570
Yes, sir.

398
00:23:56,755 --> 00:24:02,013
Now we will inspect
and palpate the abdominal cavity.

399
00:24:02,255 --> 00:24:04,653
Oh...
Those are the mets, right ?

400
00:24:04,808 --> 00:24:09,812
Throughout the stomach,
the celiac lymph nodes, the liver.

401
00:24:09,988 --> 00:24:12,862
- It's everywhere.
- So that's it ? We're closing him back up ?

402
00:24:15,686 --> 00:24:16,920
No.

403
00:24:17,568 --> 00:24:20,263
We will proceed.

404
00:24:21,255 --> 00:24:24,771
- But I thought...
- The patient asked us to proceed.

405
00:24:25,786 --> 00:24:29,970
- What does that mean exactly ?
- This man asked for a chance to fight.

406
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:35,212
What it means is...
He's gonna have to fight like hell.

407
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:37,470
But he can recover ?
There's a chance ?

408
00:24:37,765 --> 00:24:38,933
There's a chance.

409
00:24:39,816 --> 00:24:43,271
Dr. Grey, the request from the patient...

410
00:24:43,796 --> 00:24:45,301
It was private.

411
00:24:45,838 --> 00:24:46,840
Yes.

412
00:24:48,735 --> 00:24:49,770
Okay.

413
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,302
- Preston.
- Oh, Addison.

414
00:24:59,535 --> 00:25:00,353
How you feeling ?

415
00:25:01,088 --> 00:25:01,930
Better.

416
00:25:02,848 --> 00:25:04,582
Looking forward to going home.

417
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:08,720
Well, I'm sure dr. Yang is looking forward
to having you back there as well.

418
00:25:09,685 --> 00:25:11,463
Uh, maybe. I wouldn't know.

419
00:25:12,065 --> 00:25:13,642
Why wouldn't you know ?

420
00:25:14,628 --> 00:25:17,851
What...
is... is that over ?

421
00:25:18,486 --> 00:25:21,970
No, it's not over.
It's just... silent.

422
00:25:22,705 --> 00:25:28,873
Oh, yeah, yes. I heard something about this.
Um, one of the nurses was talking.
I just thought it was gossip.

423
00:25:29,355 --> 00:25:33,790
- It's not.
- So you're not talking to her. Why not ?

424
00:25:37,915 --> 00:25:41,153
- Did you ever play say "uncle"?
- Say "uncle"?

425
00:25:41,315 --> 00:25:45,670
Someone bends your arm behind your back
harder and harder until you say "uncle."

426
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:47,953
And then what happens ?

427
00:25:48,595 --> 00:25:50,960
Then they have all the power.

428
00:25:52,148 --> 00:25:53,253
I see.

429
00:25:53,537 --> 00:25:56,920
- So you are not saying "uncle."
- Yes.

430
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,052
And neither is she.

431
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,770
- It seems that way.
- That's pathetic.

432
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,411
- Well, you may be right.
- I am right.

433
00:26:05,455 --> 00:26:09,092
If you did something wrong,
then you apologize.

434
00:26:09,165 --> 00:26:10,731
Well, I didn't do anything wrong.

435
00:26:11,615 --> 00:26:13,072
Did she ?

436
00:26:15,596 --> 00:26:19,402
She doesn't seem to think so.

437
00:26:20,008 --> 00:26:23,261
That's pathetic.

438
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,922
- Hey.
- Hey.

439
00:26:38,675 --> 00:26:42,191
- You're all alone. Where's your family ?
- Eating. They like to eat.

440
00:26:43,466 --> 00:26:44,952
You're pacing.

441
00:26:45,775 --> 00:26:46,332
Yeah.

442
00:26:47,955 --> 00:26:51,133
It's just, he's been
in surgery for a while.

443
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:52,870
That's good. It means
they're being thorough.

444
00:26:52,937 --> 00:26:54,322
Or it means there are complications.

445
00:26:54,536 --> 00:26:56,970
- Somebody would've told you
if there were complications.
- Right.

446
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,960
- It's okay to be scared.
- I'm not scared.

447
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:04,541
- I'm just sayin', if you are...
- I'm not scared.
- You can talk to me.

448
00:27:05,678 --> 00:27:06,513
You sure about that ?

449
00:27:12,487 --> 00:27:14,040
Okay, now I'm scared of you.

450
00:27:14,577 --> 00:27:16,771
Damn it.
I was staring you down.

451
00:27:16,955 --> 00:27:19,120
- Staring me down ?
- Yeah, it worked on Shepherd.

452
00:27:19,196 --> 00:27:19,892
Seriously?

453
00:27:20,037 --> 00:27:20,883
Wait, wait. Let me try it again.

454
00:27:24,786 --> 00:27:26,293
- No, it's not...
- No ?

455
00:27:26,487 --> 00:27:27,583
I'm still scared.

456
00:27:29,838 --> 00:27:31,013
Hold on. I'll be right back.

457
00:27:48,098 --> 00:27:49,411
Uh, you should prepare yourself,

458
00:27:49,488 --> 00:27:52,670
because this is a much more extensive
surgery than the heart valve.

459
00:27:53,385 --> 00:27:55,750
There's probably still a tube in
his throat helping him breathe,

460
00:27:56,195 --> 00:28:00,121
and half his stomach was cut out
and part of his esophagus,
so there's gonna be a big scar.

461
00:28:00,947 --> 00:28:03,350
- Okay.
- Just... be prepared.

462
00:28:20,475 --> 00:28:22,710
Welcome back, sweetheart.

463
00:28:22,998 --> 00:28:26,123
Dad looks like something
out of the butcher shop.

464
00:28:26,686 --> 00:28:28,412
That's a cool scar.

465
00:28:42,378 --> 00:28:46,391
You need to breathe.

466
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:49,541
he's my dad.

467
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:57,991
- I know.
- He's my dad.

468
00:29:27,497 --> 00:29:30,261
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

469
00:29:30,495 --> 00:29:31,870
where is George ?

470
00:29:32,156 --> 00:29:33,632
He spent the night at the hospital.

471
00:29:33,928 --> 00:29:36,432
- And you slept in his bed.
- Mm-hmm.

472
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:37,682
All night ?

473
00:29:38,657 --> 00:29:42,461
No. Just after you fell asleep.

474
00:29:42,968 --> 00:29:46,140
So you're telling me
that my snoring is so bad--

475
00:29:46,205 --> 00:29:49,560
How did you deal with it for all those nights
before I found out about your wife ?

476
00:29:49,656 --> 00:29:52,242
He usually sleeps on the couch,
sets an alarm,

477
00:29:52,286 --> 00:29:54,390
gets back in bed before you wake up.

478
00:29:54,407 --> 00:29:56,852
Yeah, I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

479
00:29:58,315 --> 00:30:00,791
Well, I'm gonna do more
than hurt your feelings.

480
00:30:00,836 --> 00:30:01,242
What are you doing ?

481
00:30:01,298 --> 00:30:02,283
Oh. Stop it.

482
00:30:05,285 --> 00:30:06,593
I'm gonna hurt your feelings'cause...

483
00:30:20,706 --> 00:30:22,993
Can I... help you ?

484
00:30:23,828 --> 00:30:24,760
I, um...

485
00:30:25,185 --> 00:30:28,082
I-I inherited $8 million.

486
00:30:28,335 --> 00:30:31,451
- I'm sorry ?
- Almost 9, actually.

487
00:30:33,058 --> 00:30:34,782
Oh, I'm sorry.

488
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:36,743
Thank you.

489
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,931
- I'm sorry. Did you say--
- Here, just take it.

490
00:30:41,156 --> 00:30:44,223
- Just take it, please.
- Is that...

491
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:47,063
It's covered in food.

492
00:30:47,715 --> 00:30:50,250
Is this some kind of joke ?

493
00:30:50,565 --> 00:30:55,153
It is kind of a joke...
A really cruel joke.

494
00:30:56,657 --> 00:31:00,101
- I'm sorry. You want to deposit this ?
- If I wanted to deposit it,

495
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:03,601
Do you think that I would look like this ?

496
00:31:04,076 --> 00:31:06,093
I don't understand.

497
00:31:06,756 --> 00:31:09,200
I'm supposed to do something good.

498
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:13,041
I'm supposed to do something good,
and...

499
00:31:13,197 --> 00:31:17,243
and I didn't... Can... Can you just
deposit the damn thing already ?!

500
00:31:25,705 --> 00:31:27,490
I'm surprised they proceeded
with the surgery.

501
00:31:27,618 --> 00:31:30,542
Me, too. I guess they think he has a strong
enough constitution to fight the cancer.

502
00:31:30,587 --> 00:31:31,240
Is he conscious ?

503
00:31:32,718 --> 00:31:34,232
Still intubated,
so they have him sedated.

504
00:31:37,775 --> 00:31:40,363
The main concern
for the next few days.

505
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:42,651
Will be multisystem organ failure.

506
00:31:42,906 --> 00:31:46,550
That is that the surgery was too intense
for his weakened organs to support.

507
00:31:47,335 --> 00:31:48,401
You want to watch the kidneys

508
00:31:48,556 --> 00:31:51,770
because if the kidneys fail, that's a sign
that everything else is starting to go.

509
00:31:51,895 --> 00:31:53,873
- So we're watching the kidneys.
- You're watching the kidneys.

510
00:31:53,905 --> 00:31:54,390
Thank you.

511
00:31:55,968 --> 00:31:57,730
Oh, do you mind me asking,

512
00:31:58,267 --> 00:31:58,983
Uh, how's your hand ?

513
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:01,073
I don't mind if you ask.

514
00:32:01,867 --> 00:32:03,780
I will mind if you tell Cristina.

515
00:32:04,616 --> 00:32:07,402
You two have a strange relationship.

516
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:09,440
Yes, we do.

517
00:32:11,936 --> 00:32:16,982
And when you go home, you're gonna have
your very own room. Yes, you do.

518
00:32:18,575 --> 00:32:20,900
and your mom, she got one of those, um,

519
00:32:21,057 --> 00:32:23,513
you know, uh, those stencils.
Mm-hmm.

520
00:32:23,578 --> 00:32:26,833
And she made little butterflies
and flowers.

521
00:32:29,985 --> 00:32:31,071
You need something ?

522
00:32:31,996 --> 00:32:33,332
No, I'm fine.

523
00:32:36,995 --> 00:32:39,051
Oh, it gets quiet in here.

524
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:40,291
You're the one who paged me ?

525
00:32:40,455 --> 00:32:44,041
I started my shift ten minutes ago, noticed
her stomach looked a little distended.

526
00:32:44,148 --> 00:32:47,041
Her stomach's distended ?
I... I didn't notice that.

527
00:32:47,255 --> 00:32:48,420
It's hard to see.

528
00:32:49,478 --> 00:32:51,493
Page dr. Montgomery, stat.

529
00:32:52,998 --> 00:32:54,781
Is everything okay ? Is this bad ?

530
00:32:55,298 --> 00:32:57,482
Well, let's just wait for
dr. Montgomery.

531
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:05,690
What's the matter ?

532
00:33:06,408 --> 00:33:09,030
- My father's here.
- Your father ?

533
00:33:09,728 --> 00:33:12,570
The one I don't talk to
and barely know, he's here.

534
00:33:12,618 --> 00:33:13,703
What, is he here to see you ?

535
00:33:13,837 --> 00:33:16,853
- No. He's here with his other family.
- Oh, sorry.

536
00:33:22,446 --> 00:33:24,000
Where do you sleep at the trailer ?

537
00:33:24,777 --> 00:33:30,752
- What ?
- When we sleep at the trailer,
where do you sleep ?

538
00:33:31,418 --> 00:33:35,001
You know the hammock outside?
Sorry.

539
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:42,292
I'm a girl with abandonment issues.
You have to sleep with me from now on.

540
00:33:43,006 --> 00:33:44,320
Okay.

541
00:33:45,286 --> 00:33:47,822
Okay.

542
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,980
A note from my hack
of a shrink. I get to scrub in.

543
00:33:52,067 --> 00:33:54,550
- Not till I say so.
- I deposited the damn check.

544
00:33:54,577 --> 00:33:58,163
You cheap son of a bitch bastards
are going straight to hell...

545
00:33:58,246 --> 00:34:00,112
straight to hell !

546
00:34:00,565 --> 00:34:01,581
Ms. Douglas?

547
00:34:02,068 --> 00:34:03,890
Insurance bastards.

548
00:34:05,028 --> 00:34:07,071
They say the surgery's too experimental.

549
00:34:07,248 --> 00:34:07,990
They won't pay.

550
00:34:08,116 --> 00:34:10,571
It's a $200,000 surgery,

551
00:34:10,726 --> 00:34:13,493
plus a hospital stay, plus rehab.

552
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:16,040
Even if I get three jobs...

553
00:34:16,426 --> 00:34:18,720
Son of a bitch bastards.

554
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:23,722
Looks like there won't be a surgery
to scrub in on. Sorry, stevens.

555
00:34:24,886 --> 00:34:25,393
Talk to me.

556
00:34:25,736 --> 00:34:28,580
Her abdomen was distended and she needed
an increased ventilatory support,

557
00:34:28,638 --> 00:34:31,271
- so I ordered some x-rays.
- I'm sorry. I was talking to her.
I didn't notice.

558
00:34:31,308 --> 00:34:33,471
She's got massive free air
trapped beath her diaphragm.

559
00:34:33,497 --> 00:34:35,180
Mr. Grey, we need to get
Laura into surgery.

560
00:34:35,225 --> 00:34:36,942
What ? Another surgery ? Why ?

561
00:34:37,038 --> 00:34:39,160
Her x-rays indicate there's
a perforation in the bowel.

562
00:34:39,218 --> 00:34:40,501
We need to get in there right away.

563
00:34:40,585 --> 00:34:42,240
Here's a consent form.
We need you to sign it.

564
00:34:42,305 --> 00:34:44,723
I don't... I... I don't know...

565
00:34:45,266 --> 00:34:47,073
her... her mother has the flu.

566
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:48,440
What, you're not authorized to sign ?

567
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:51,210
I am. But I... I'd like to fill her in

568
00:34:50,638 --> 00:34:52,923
we don't have time
for you to not know, mr. Grey.

569
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:54,992
Your granddaughter doesn't have time.

570
00:34:56,448 --> 00:34:57,400
All right.

571
00:35:00,438 --> 00:35:02,903
Take out more of the bowel.
I need better visualization.

572
00:35:03,048 --> 00:35:05,033
It's so tiny, I'm afraid
I might crush it.

573
00:35:05,326 --> 00:35:06,912
Oh, it's tougher than you think.

574
00:35:07,026 --> 00:35:08,361
Go ahead and give it a little squeeze.

575
00:35:08,575 --> 00:35:11,101
Cool. Thanks.

576
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:17,220
Look at that. The N.G. Tube has eroded
right through the stomach wall.

577
00:35:17,738 --> 00:35:20,712
I may have to resect an entire portion
of the stomach.

578
00:35:21,436 --> 00:35:24,571
She's hypotensive.
Push 30 ccs of albumin.

579
00:35:33,647 --> 00:35:35,422
- Whew.
- Scary.

580
00:35:35,866 --> 00:35:39,872
You're telling me.
This is Meredith's Grey's niece.

581
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:42,901
If I lost her, people might
think I did it on purpose.

582
00:35:51,077 --> 00:35:53,460
- How's it going ?
- Okay.

583
00:35:53,755 --> 00:35:56,322
They had a scare a minute ago,
but she stabilized.

584
00:35:57,615 --> 00:36:02,333
Your, uh, father is pacing
up and down the halls.

585
00:36:03,408 --> 00:36:07,582
He's worried.
Maybe you can give him an update.

586
00:36:08,608 --> 00:36:11,992
Maybe you can give him an update.

587
00:36:13,068 --> 00:36:15,950
He's not a big fan of mine.

588
00:36:16,578 --> 00:36:21,470
- He's not a big fan of mine either.
- Oh, I can't imagine that's true.

589
00:36:24,828 --> 00:36:27,471
Your mother was a force
to be reckoned with.

590
00:36:27,788 --> 00:36:30,293
If she wanted things a certain way, I...

591
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:35,511
I'm saying your father
was a good man when I knew him.

592
00:36:36,077 --> 00:36:39,200
He may have a side in this that
you don't know anything about.

593
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:44,860
What, you think he tried to send me a
card every year and my mother has a
whole drawer full of unopened cards ?

594
00:36:46,115 --> 00:36:50,133
Because it's not often that my life
turns out that way.

595
00:36:51,357 --> 00:36:55,663
I don't know. You don't know either
until you ask him.

596
00:37:03,696 --> 00:37:05,901
Hey. How's he doing ?

597
00:37:06,377 --> 00:37:09,351
Uh, Georgie is obsessed
with our dad's pee.

598
00:37:09,446 --> 00:37:10,400
Yeah, this is weird,

599
00:37:10,616 --> 00:37:12,610
- even for georgie.
- Boys, be nice.

600
00:37:12,645 --> 00:37:13,801
It's his kidney function.

601
00:37:14,097 --> 00:37:16,761
I'm obsessed with his
kidney function, not his pee.

602
00:37:16,966 --> 00:37:18,192
And I'm not obsessed.

603
00:37:19,518 --> 00:37:20,380
I'm excited.

604
00:37:21,055 --> 00:37:22,901
You're not gonna drink that,
are you, Georgie ?

605
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:24,683
130 ccs!

606
00:37:25,177 --> 00:37:27,922
130 ccs of shiny, yellow urine !

607
00:37:28,006 --> 00:37:30,040
130 ccs in how long?

608
00:37:30,278 --> 00:37:31,642
- Four hours.
- No way !

609
00:37:32,107 --> 00:37:33,721
That is fantastic!

610
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:36,440
Thank you !

611
00:37:42,106 --> 00:37:43,671
Thank you.

612
00:37:44,315 --> 00:37:45,630
Thank you.

613
00:37:50,327 --> 00:37:51,831
Mark.

614
00:37:56,627 --> 00:37:58,603
I'm sorry you're hurting.

615
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:02,311
You're sorry I'm hurting
or you're sorry ?

616
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:14,872
Karev.

617
00:38:15,158 --> 00:38:17,852
Oh. Hey. I was, uh

618
00:38:18,248 --> 00:38:22,200
- just checking the baby's capillary refills
- No, it's good, it's good.

619
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:26,613
We all need a little human contact
from time to time.

620
00:38:27,267 --> 00:38:31,482
It sucks. It's like she hasn't had
a chance to deserve this, you know ?

621
00:38:33,677 --> 00:38:36,183
Is that why you want to go into plastics,

622
00:38:36,816 --> 00:38:39,410
'cause people sign up
for the pain they get ?

623
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:43,783
Yeah. For the most part, they do, yeah.

624
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:52,253
You're right. It does suck
watching them struggle.

625
00:38:53,526 --> 00:38:56,461
And that part never stops sucking.

626
00:38:57,006 --> 00:39:01,711
But... then when you get
to see a baby heal and, um...

627
00:39:02,037 --> 00:39:04,562
they get to go home and...

628
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,322
you just imagine this whole life
that they're gonna live,

629
00:39:09,018 --> 00:39:10,661
there's nothing better than that.

630
00:39:11,488 --> 00:39:13,421
And that part never changes.

631
00:39:14,877 --> 00:39:15,843
But...

632
00:39:16,737 --> 00:39:20,200
- if you want to go back to plastics...
- Nah.

633
00:39:21,268 --> 00:39:22,992
The vanilla latte ?

634
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:27,693
- I did that on purpose.
- Why ?

635
00:39:28,787 --> 00:39:30,381
'Cause he was rude to you.

636
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:43,483
- I'm, uh, sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

637
00:39:43,577 --> 00:39:46,660
- Sorry.
- Gosh, I'm... really sorry.
- No, I'm okay. I'm, uh,

638
00:39:46,738 --> 00:39:49,252
I'm just, um... I'm gonna...

639
00:39:49,308 --> 00:39:50,682
Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah.

640
00:39:52,347 --> 00:39:54,310
(Travis'"love will come through" playing)

641
00:39:57,508 --> 00:39:59,150
Oh, hey. You need some help ?

642
00:39:59,257 --> 00:40:01,012
I can walk to the bathroom myself.

643
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:03,873
I've been doing it my whole life,
and nothing's changing any time soon,

644
00:40:03,956 --> 00:40:05,593
so just get out of my way, okay ?

645

646
