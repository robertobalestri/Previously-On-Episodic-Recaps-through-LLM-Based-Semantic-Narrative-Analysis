00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:05,281
Can I have the key back?
Heard we broke up, I want it back.

3
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:07,200
- Can I have it, please?
- You find an apartment yet?

4
00:00:07,224 --> 00:00:09,469
'Cause I was thinking
about getting one.

5
00:00:09,493 --> 00:00:11,610
Can you make sure I
stay on Dr. Hahn's cardio?

6
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,945
Where are guys going? You
going to Joe's? I'll meet you.

7
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,697
I can't sleep. What's
wrong with me?

8
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:18,850
- Severe abandonment issues.
- Psych is crap.

9
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:21,620
- Derek kissed Rose?
- Yesterday we were dating
other people.

10
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:24,189
- That's not the point. Rose is?
- You weren't ready.

I read a study that, uh...

25
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:09,234
says that just the act of
going to therapy is beneficial,

anything. Even if you just sit.

- Your residents.

75
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,164
They've been living in the
hospital around-the-clock

76
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,266
for the last 14 days.

77
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,836
Engaged in a surgical

Four surgeries on my schedule.

00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,523
The lions can fight all they
want. I'm not a zookeeper.

84
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:54,199

- Ooh!
- Move it!

86
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:06,278
- She's wretched. And mean.
- No, she's not.

87
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,064
I heard nurses saying
they've only been on five dates.

88
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,444
'Cause Derek knows
she's wretched and mean.

89
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:13,001
- Yeah.
- What did you do to your hair?

90
00:04:13,103 --> 00:04:15,637
You guys. I know you're
trying to make me feel better

91
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:17,038
but I have to tell you,

92
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,125
this pausing to talk about
Rose and Derek just means...

93
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,227
Yeah?

94
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,229
- I'm going to win!
- You bitch!

95
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,763
Ow! What?

96
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,716
Keeping it clean was
getting in the way,

97
00:04:27,818 --> 00:04:29,134
so I chopped it off.

98
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,314
It makes me faster and
sleeker like a cheetah.

99
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,338
You chopped your
hair for a stupid contest?

100
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,442
Not stupid. Rock star
contest. Best contest ever.

101
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:40,345
Try living in the hospital
for two weeks. It's amazing.

102
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,648
- This contest is for residents.
- Yes, I know that!

103
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,717
It doesn't mean he can't live
here. I feel juiced and alive,

104
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,520
my brain is running. I have
never been more on my game.

105
00:04:48,605 --> 00:04:50,989
I'm kind of sad the
contest ends tonight.

106
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,025
- I'm not. I want that prize.
- What prize?

107
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:55,238
Bailey won't tell
us. But I want it bad.

108
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:58,796
- Too bad you're never
going to get it.
- So on my game!

109
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:06,037
- What?
- Yeah. Hi.

110
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,523
Morning. Thank you.

111
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,092
What do you see in
her? Is it the hot sex?

112
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:13,606
Is she an animal?
Is she a bobcat?

113
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,280
- Mark.
- Come on.

114
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,510
Lady on the streets,
tramp in the sheets?

115
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:20,135
Oh, yeah. She's
amazing. Hot. Sweaty.

116
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,203
Very dirty, hot, sweaty sex.

117
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:23,872
You haven't slept with her yet?

118
00:05:23,974 --> 00:05:26,875
She's waiting until we're
serious. She has morals, a lady.

119
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:28,960
- Know what's better than sex?
- What?

120
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:30,928
Anticipation.

121
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,997
Anticipation, my friend.

122
00:05:34,117 --> 00:05:35,884
Why didn't anybody wake me?

123
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:37,318
Why would we help you?

124
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,088
- There's such a thing as honor.
- Dog-eat-dog, Karev.

125
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,607
- Suck it up.
- I'm not doing that.

126
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,037
- You are going to.
- I'm not.

127
00:05:44,061 --> 00:05:47,595
- Callie, Callie. Callie!
- Oh, hey.

128
00:05:47,697 --> 00:05:50,665
- You came in with Dr. Hahn?
- Erica? Yeah.

129
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,834
We went out last night
and then it got kind of late

130
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,619
with the dancing and the...

131
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:56,988
We never made it home,
so hitched a ride here.

132
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,424
- Hanging out with Dr. Hahn?
- Erica. Yes.

133
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:01,375
So, you and Hahn are friends?

134
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:04,545
Erica. Yeah.

135
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:09,117
See, this is the
downside of the contest.

136
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:11,703
I'm here, Callie's
living in my apartment

137
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,272
- and hanging out with Hahn.
- They're picking up guys.

138
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,441
I'm past that. I
don't need guys.

139
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,709
I don't need sex.
Competition is my orgasm.

140
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,773
I could be hanging
out with Hahn.

141
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,364
Cristina, would you focus?

142
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,665
It is more fun kicking
your ass when you focus.

143
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:28,531
- Who's winning?
- Yang.

144
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,732
- Surprised?
- What?

145
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,723
Let me see.

146
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,658
I'm 26 points behind?
That's not possible.

147
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,177
Count again. What
about surgeries?

148
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,979
Three points for
watching. Got to do.

149
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:40,732
I do do. I can't make
them let me do procedures.

150
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:44,085
- You got to ask.
- Take charge of
your own destiny.

151
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:45,837
Make it happen. Like this.

152
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,091
- What do you got?
- Otis Sharon, 61 year-old male,

153
00:06:50,194 --> 00:06:52,305
unconscious on a corner
with a swollen ankle.

154
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,829
Not it.

155
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:57,048
- I don't know what happened.
- - Initial BP was 90 over palp.

156
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,800
Vitals stable after
a bolus of NS.

157
00:06:58,902 --> 00:07:01,386
OK, he's mine!
All of you back off!

158
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,149
- It's a swollen ankle.
- He passed out.

159
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,218
He's pale, altered, and a rash.

160
00:07:05,242 --> 00:07:07,775
You see a sprained ankle,
I see a medical mystery.

161
00:07:07,878 --> 00:07:09,410
Eighty points.

162
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:11,963
Stevens is the only one working?

163
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,732
No. We're all
working. We got paged.

164
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:16,251
The ankle's gone. You
trolling for traumas?

165
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,464
Somebody could come
with a critical injury.

166

We're proactive.

167
00:07:19,622 --> 00:07:22,040

I've got no one on
post-op and pre-op. Move!

169
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:28,012
- Help us! Please help!
- Help my brother!

170
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,801
I'm getting a gurney!

171
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:34,736
He's bleeding.

172
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:36,771
- What happened?
- A bear.

173
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,207
- A what?
- He tried to stop the bleeding.

174
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,292
- We were camping.
- You drove here?

175
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,428
Couldn't wait for an
ambulance. I'm fine.

176
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,864
No, you're not. Let
me see your hand.

177
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:46,966
I'm fine.

178
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:49,267
- Sir, let's get on this gurney.
- Careful.

179
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:52,504
OK. Step down
right here. All right.

180
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,957
- Careful.
- Slowly.

181
00:07:57,294 --> 00:07:59,760
Whoa! Whoa!

182
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:02,263
Intestines in the hands!
Intestines in the hands!

183
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:05,467
- Did you just say...
- Intestine in the hands!

184
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,641
He just touched it. He
just put his hand out.

185
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,054
- And he touched a bear?
- A cub.

186
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,795
And then the mother came.

187
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,777
- I bet she did.
- Why would he do that?

188
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,132
We go camping
all the time. Why...

189
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:23,212
OK, try to relax, Mr. Robinson.

190
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:26,021
All right, get me a
chest tube tray, please.

191
00:08:26,123 --> 00:08:28,940
- Did I hear bear attack?
- Complete evisceration.

192
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,559
Get me 100 sux, 20 of etomidate.

193
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:34,212
Get me an intubation
tray and an OR room now.

194
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:35,580
You going to put me under?

195
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:39,200
Sir, it'll be the best thing
that's happened to you all day.

196
00:08:39,302 --> 00:08:41,619
Is my brother going
to be OK? Please.

197
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,939
This whole thing's my
fault. I got to know if he's OK.

198
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,475
They're taking him to
surgery. They don't know.

199
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:50,211
- We'll keep you informed.
- OK. OK.

200
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:52,997
Impressive hand, Phillip.
I can see through it.

201
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:56,367
The bear cub, she just
latched on and wouldn't let go.

202
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,052
When Scott came
over to try to help,

203
00:08:58,155 --> 00:08:59,571
the mother she...

204
00:08:59,656 --> 00:09:01,622
I can't believe
we got out alive.

205
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:03,391
He has to be all right.

206
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:07,161
He's going to be all right.
He has to be, right? Right?

207
00:09:07,263 --> 00:09:08,763
He has to be all right.

208
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:10,982
You don't remember how you fell?

209
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,263
One minute I was
walking down the street,

210
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:15,397
the next, there were
paramedics over me.

211
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,123
Have you been dizzy?
Like the room is spinning?

212
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,590
Maybe a little.

213
00:09:19,676 --> 00:09:22,761
Any muscle aches?
Fatigue? Fever? Headaches?

214
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:25,413
Well, now that
you mention it, yes.

215
00:09:25,515 --> 00:09:26,998
Any recent travels?

216
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,403
Well, I go back and forth
to the East Coast for my job.

217
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,653
- Does that count?
- Tick or mosquito bites?

218
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:33,071
I live near a lake.

219
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,557
I get mosquito
bites all the time.

220
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:39,393
Oh, God, do I have
something bad, like malaria

221
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,596
- West Nile virus or something?
- Oh, no, no.

222
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:42,897
There's no need to panic.

223
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,300
We're going to take this
one step at a time. OK?

224
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:47,152
OK.

225
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:50,288
Mama Bear wasn't messing around.

226
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,373
Mama bears never mess around.

227
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:54,158
I have a Ross procedure,

228
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,995
but I want to keep an eye
on his chest tube outputs

229
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,347
and blood pressure.
What's the game plan?

230
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:01,511
He's a set up for
overwhelming sepsis.

231
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,984
Deal with the life-threatening
blood loss, get out.

232
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:06,170
You can't touch
him until he's stable.

233
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,473
I'm in OR four. Can
I get hourly updates?

234
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,959
I'd be happy to apprise
you of his condition.

235
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:12,694
Fine.

236
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,465
You don't get points
for sucking up, Yang.

237
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:18,866
Shut up.

238
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,366
I hate this contest.

239
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,741
There's a lot of stuff in here.

240
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:30,762
Stupid, stupid contest.
Stupid. Irresponsible.

241
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,248
I wanna play!

242
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,916
- Good, free stuff.
- I need a butterfly needle,

243
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:38,219
a Vacutainer, and
maybe an LP kit.

244
00:10:38,321 --> 00:10:39,965
I'm 26 points behind
so I need it fast.

245
00:10:39,989 --> 00:10:42,523
- Why? You got something good?
- A sprained ankle.

246
00:10:42,626 --> 00:10:45,159
26 points for a sprained ankle?

247
00:10:45,261 --> 00:10:48,146
Callie treated what we
thought was a sprained ankle,

248
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:51,265
patient was malnourished,
had a perforated ulcer and died.

249
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,601
That's the best case scenario.

250
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:56,071
Not the death part, the
medical mystery part.

251
00:10:56,173 --> 00:10:58,234
80 points for solving
a medical mystery.

252
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,369
The holy grail of
the competition.

253
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,244
Oh, yeah. Sometimes an
ankle's just an ankle though.

254
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:08,366
Syncope, a very strange rash,

255
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:12,002
pale, insidious onset in
a guy who travels a lot,

256
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,471
this is not just an ankle!

257
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,342
Oh. Thanks.

258
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,246
Oh, I could do a lot with these.

259
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,849
That's an underpad.

260
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,634
Underpads soak up urine.

261
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:30,321
Or... it could be a placemat.

262
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:37,511
Oh! Fruit bowl!

263
00:11:43,153 --> 00:11:47,021
Done. I beat you.
Busted hand and all.

264
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,240
- It's completely illegible.
- He's a slob.

265
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,659
- I still beat her.
- Mr. Robinson,

266
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:54,429
Dr. O'Malley is going to
come and take you to X-ray.

267
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,164
And I'm going to take your wife

268
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:58,666
to the waiting room
until you get back.

269
00:11:58,768 --> 00:12:00,618
She said wife. Still
not used to that.

270
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,837
- We're newlyweds.
- Congratulations.

271
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:04,889
She's my rebound girl.

272
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,025
Um, he's a little hopped
up on pain killers right now.

273
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:11,262
- Over-sharing.
- She thought she was
my rebound girl,

274
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,481
but I rebounded her all
the way to the church.

275
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,716
Only knew her ten days.

276
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:19,937
But when you know,
you know. You know?

277
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,456
I'm leaving you.

278
00:12:23,593 --> 00:12:25,760
I'll miss you while you're gone.

279
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:31,716
<i>Ortho resident to the ER stat.
Ortho resident to the ER stat.</i>

280
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:34,686
Are you OK?

281
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:39,039
It's just... you know,
you marry a man like that

282
00:12:39,141 --> 00:12:41,092
or a man like that marries you.

283
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,511
And he's cute and he's rich...

284
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:47,081
he's a catch, by
anyone's standards.

285
00:12:48,718 --> 00:12:51,686
So, you sit around waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

286
00:12:51,788 --> 00:12:55,089
Because there's no way a
man like that marries you.

287
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,374
Or me.

288
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,177
He married me.

289
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:09,404
I'm sorry. I must look
like a crazy woman.

290
00:13:09,506 --> 00:13:11,338
It's OK. But you're
bleeding a little.

291
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:12,974
Do you mind if I take a look?

292
00:13:13,076 --> 00:13:14,658
Oh, no. I'm fine.

293
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,696
I just scratched myself on a
branch when we were running.

294
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,250
Why are you looking
at me like that?

295
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:26,904
CT's clear.

296
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,390
But it's deep. That
bear clawed you good.

297
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:30,975
I didn't even feel it.

298
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:33,477
Adrenaline's a
pretty powerful drug.

299
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:37,014
You have to repair the galea, it
should reattach without a problem.

300
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,533
Squeeze my fingers
as hard as you can.

301
00:13:39,635 --> 00:13:40,968
I just got happy.

302
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,054
I just got married
and I'm happy.

303
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,268
I don't have permanent
brain damage, do I?

304
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,892
No. It appears that you do not.

305
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,310
OK, good.

306
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,628
Page me if any
neuro deficits appear.

307
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:59,037
You got lucky. Your scalp
wasn't completely taken off,

308
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:01,639
we can sew it on. Your
hair should cover the scar.

309
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:06,110
- You won't even need surgery.
- Wow. That's great. Thank you.

310
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,422
Dr. Grey will take care of you.

311
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,963
Go back to being
a happy newlywed.

312
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:14,418
Don't worry. He
and Rose won't last.

313
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,375
He's hypothermic and
his bowels are swollen.

314
00:14:21,478 --> 00:14:24,295
We need to stabilize him in the
ICU and get him back to the OR

315
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:25,677
when he's less acidotic.

316
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:28,682
Gives us time to deal with
puncture wounds and lacerations.

317
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,118
I'm sorry, one of you has
several hundred sutures

318
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:32,598
- ahead of you.
- I'll do it!

319
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,788
- I need practice.
- Your stitches are flawless,

320
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,358
- I need the work.
- Flawless because I practice.

321
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,900
- Karev, it's yours.
- Yes.

322
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:40,845
- Come on.
- You need to update Hahn

323
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:42,813
on the condition of
the patient hourly.

324
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,750
A minute an hour. I can
suture the other fifty-nine.

325
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:47,968
Fine. You both do it.

326
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,070
That's not fair.

327
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:51,272
This man was a
chew toy for a bear.

328
00:14:51,374 --> 00:14:52,707
There'll be enough to go around.

329
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,276
A lot of enthusiasm for
an afternoon of stitching.

330
00:14:55,378 --> 00:14:58,563
Some people find it boring.
I value the fundamentals.

331
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:01,699
It's a point a suture. Kiss ass.

332
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:20,167
It is a hairline fracture.

333
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:22,102
CSR and CRP's were elevated.

334
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:24,688
I also appreciated some
swelling in the knee.

335
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,157
What does that mean?

336
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,893
There could be some sort of
inflammatory process going on.

337
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,612
- That sounds bad.
- I don't want you to worry yet.

338
00:15:31,714 --> 00:15:33,631
- Yet?
- Is there someone I can call?

339
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,633
Maybe you shouldn't
be alone here.

340
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,235
Um... How are his labs?

341
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:40,605
WBC's normal, slightly anemic,
potassium's mildly decreased.

342
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:41,984
OK. Give him a K-rider,

343
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:43,752
see if you can tap
the fluid in his knee

344
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,593
for white cells or crystals.
Let me know if it's positive.

345
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,831
- Good luck, Mr. Sharon.
- You think I need luck?

346
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:52,599
Oh, God. I want to go home.

347
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,836
I want to go home.
Look, I want to go back!

348
00:15:55,938 --> 00:15:58,133
I want to go back
to when I was 30

349
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,740
and I want to stop smoking.

350
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:02,543
Or back to when I was 20 and
not start smoking in first place.

351
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:05,040
I want to give up coffee
and junk food and beer

352
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:08,299
and I want to be healthy like my
ex-wife always nagged me to be.

353
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,334
She was a saint.

354
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,637
She was a saint
and I drove her away.

355
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,817
I want to go back
and not drive her away.

356
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:19,059
So I don't end up at 60,
sick and fat and alone

357
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:20,406
and scared in some hospital

358
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,230
with some beautiful young
doctor holding my hand.

359
00:16:23,332 --> 00:16:25,900
She wouldn't be holding
my hand except she's trying

360
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:29,053
to figure out what horrible
disease I'm going to die of.

361
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:32,440
I want to go home.

362
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:35,159
- Whoa. Where's the fire?
- Can't talk now.

363
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:38,546
Got to kick Karev's
ass suturing.

364
00:16:38,648 --> 00:16:40,915
Since when are you
friends with my mentor?

365
00:16:41,017 --> 00:16:43,734
She's not your mentor
because she treats you like crap.

366
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,036
If you weren't living in
the hospital like a dog,

367
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,506
you'd notice Erica and I
have been friends a while.

368
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,728
- Put in a good word for me?
- Don't talk about you.

369
00:16:50,827 --> 00:16:53,077
- I let you live with me!
- He's in the elevator.

370
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,356
- Who?
- Alex.

371
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,699
Hold it! Hold it!

372
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:01,152
It needs surgery, but
Callie wants 24 hours

373
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:02,686
of antibiotic coverage,

374
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,621
so I think we should
just irrigate and splint.

375
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,725
- OK, I'll take care of it.
- Or I could take care of it

376
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,694
and you could take
care of the wife's scalp.

377
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,479
She needs lots of
complex sutures.

378
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:14,882
You could get lots
of complex practice.

379
00:17:14,984 --> 00:17:17,601
Isn't it like a point a
suture? You don't want that?

380
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,353
This is bigger
than a broken hand.

381
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,723
He provoked a bear and then
drove himself to the hospital.

382
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:25,025
- He was in shock.
- He married his rebound girl.

383
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,362
- What?
- He married his rebound girl.

384
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,482
After knowing her for only
ten days. Nobody does that.

385
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:32,584
Who does that?

386
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:33,784
I'm thinking brain tumor.

387
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,886
I got married in the
spur of the moment

388
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,201
and I don't have a brain tumor.

389
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,757
That you know of.

390
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:41,542
- I'll do the scalp.
- You will?

391
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,011
Watch you turn a broken
hand into a neuro problem

392
00:17:44,113 --> 00:17:46,213
just to, uh... get some
extra points? Nope.

393
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,949
It's not about the points.

394
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,229
Watch you turn a broken
hand into a neuro problem

395
00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:52,497
just so you have a
reason to talk to Shepherd?

396
00:17:52,521 --> 00:17:55,639
Nope.

397
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,142
I do not need a reason
to talk to Shepherd!

398
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,728
If I want to talk to
Shepherd I'll talk...

399
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:15,693
Whoa! Hey.

400
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:17,161
What is this? Is this a hint?

401
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,629
I should be getting
you more gifts.

402
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,742
A grateful patient
gave them to me.

403
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,046
But since you're asking,

404
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:23,796
I do like a nice
box of chocolates.

405
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,285
You're gonna die
of a diabetic coma

406
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:27,188
- I don't want any part.
- Cheapskate.

407
00:18:27,223 --> 00:18:29,389
Crackhead.

408
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:37,226
Have you seen him?

409
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,832
- I have.
- Have you seen his eyes?

410
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:40,451
Yeah.

411
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:43,671
I'm trying to play it cool. I
am playing it so, so cool.

412
00:18:43,773 --> 00:18:45,405
I love him.

413
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:49,910
Oh, my God. I don't... know you.

414
00:18:50,012 --> 00:18:52,763
I didn't say that.

415
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,190
What's with the flowers?

416
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,253
Are you asking as a
resident or a sister?

417
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,794
- Sister.
- I'm stealing stuff.

418
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,847
OK.

419
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,967
Are you OK?

420
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:16,771
Resident again now. Stop
stealing crap from the hospital.

421
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,140
Twenty-two.

422
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,559
- Keep a lid on it.
- I like to know where I am.

423
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,278
PH is up to seven
point two-eight.

424
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,947
Not great, but it's improving.

425
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:28,449
Push another amp
of bicarb for a boost.

426
00:19:28,551 --> 00:19:31,168
- Karev's only at 17.
- You're not helping!

427
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,254
Did you just yell at the Chief?

428
00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:34,454
Uh... S-sorry, sir.

429
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:35,923
Should end this competition.

430
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:37,374
No!

431
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,210
I mean, uh... it's-it's fine.

432
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:41,111
Actually they're
doing some nice work.

433
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:44,682
Twenty-three. She's beating
the pants off of you, Karev.

434
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,366
Don't you have an
update to deliver?

435
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:48,268
Hahn can wait a couple minutes.

436
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,536
Yang.

437
00:19:50,306 --> 00:19:52,506
Crap.

438
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,959
I thought you told me to keep
the animals under control?

439
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:59,413
From time to time, I
like to go to the zoo.

440
00:20:03,486 --> 00:20:07,087
Dr. Hahn. Mr. Robinson
is critical, but stable.

441
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:09,473
We had to put him on low
dose Levofed for his BP

442
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,675
and he's put out 350
cc's from his chest tube.

443
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:15,162
I'll look forward to another
scintillating report in an hour.

444
00:20:15,264 --> 00:20:16,864
Of course.

445
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:24,004
I'm thinking we ought to
have a contest of our own.

446
00:20:24,106 --> 00:20:26,307
You wanna live in the
hospital like rodents?

447
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:27,708
Different kind of contest.

448
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,343
You and Rose aren't
exclusive, right?

449
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:31,256
- I'm thinking...
- You're not serious.

450
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,981
One woman, 10 points.
Two women, same time, 20.

451
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,416
You get out before anybody
wakes up, 5 point bonus.

452
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:37,763
You are serious.

453
00:20:37,787 --> 00:20:40,153
You need a little spice
in your life. I'm trying help.

454
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:42,956
I am truly a worse human
being for knowing you.

455
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,560
Ow. Ow!

456
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:50,230
- It's OK, Mr. Sharon.
- It's not OK! It hurts!

457
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:56,103
I'm alone. I'm all alone and it
hurts and I'm not OK. I'm dying!

458
00:20:56,205 --> 00:20:59,540
By some lucky stroke of fate,

459
00:20:59,642 --> 00:21:01,186
you fractured your
ankle and ended up

460
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,411
at Seattle Grace Hospital
with me as a doctor.

461
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,692
And I am going to find
out what's wrong with you

462
00:21:06,716 --> 00:21:09,183
and I'm gonna do my
damnedest to fix it. If I can't,

463
00:21:09,285 --> 00:21:11,496
I'm gonna assemble
doctors better than me

464
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,365
and they're gonna
do their damnedest.

465
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:15,233
And you know what's
going to happen?

466
00:21:15,257 --> 00:21:17,992
- What?
- You're gonna live
a healthier life.

467
00:21:18,094 --> 00:21:19,459
Maybe even call your ex-wife

468
00:21:19,562 --> 00:21:22,063
because you're being
given a second chance at life.

469
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:26,000
And this time... This
time you can do it right.

470
00:21:26,102 --> 00:21:28,635
You're going to
feel a little pressure.

471
00:21:29,906 --> 00:21:32,106
Ow!

472
00:21:36,145 --> 00:21:39,346
Chief? Mr. Robinson's brother.

473
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:42,266
- Can I talk to him?
- Just for a minute.

474
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,853
Hey, man.

475
00:21:45,955 --> 00:21:47,755
That you, Phil?

476
00:21:47,857 --> 00:21:49,406
How you feeling?

477
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:55,028
I feel like a bear ate my
guts out or something.

478
00:21:55,131 --> 00:21:58,632
You touched a cub,
man. What the hell?

479
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:02,819
I wasn't thinking. I'm so sorry.

480
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,188
So, touching the
cub, you knew better?

481
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,573
Of course he knew better.

482
00:22:06,675 --> 00:22:08,419
He's having an
early midlife crisis.

483
00:22:08,443 --> 00:22:09,760
He's going to kill us all.

484
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:11,328
I'm not having a midlife crisis.

485
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,657
Dude, dude, dude.

486
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:14,265
You married your midlife crisis.

487
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:16,400
Just 'cause you
got eaten by a bear,

488
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,852
you don't get to talk
smack about my wife.

489
00:22:18,955 --> 00:22:22,806
Was this spontaneous
wedding out of character for you?

490
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:26,360
He needs a little rest,
so let's have some quiet.

491
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,284
Where was I?

492
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:34,501
Fifty-nine.

493
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,955
You are toast.

494
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:39,739
Tick-tock.

495
00:22:43,212 --> 00:22:45,379
Yang, no running
in the hospital!

496
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:55,355
<i>Dr. Benton to ICU one.
Dr. Benton to ICU one.</i>

497
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:59,693
Why did we do a spinal
tap on an ankle fracture?

498
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,095
He's getting the full work up.

499
00:23:01,197 --> 00:23:03,297
- How many points?
- What?

500
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:06,183
Look me in the eyes and tell
me you are not putting this man

501
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:08,151
through painful procedures

502
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:09,903
because you're
trying to win a contest.

503
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:12,539
I'm doing this because my
patient had dyspnea on exertion,

504
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,208
headaches, fever, myalgia,

505
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,610
a confluent rash
over his entire body.

506
00:23:16,712 --> 00:23:19,379
I'm working him up for
RMSF and doing Lyme titers,

507
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,915
but I'm worried about
autoimmune or rheumatoid disease

508
00:23:22,017 --> 00:23:24,568
because of his high CRP
and sed rates. Or maybe lupus.

509
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,531
I'm doing a spinal tap
because he was altered

510
00:23:26,555 --> 00:23:30,541
and is amnestic about his fall
earlier. I do want to win this contest.

511
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:33,477
I also want to make sure that a
man does not leave this hospital

512
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,313
with meningitis or encephalitis
and discover too late

513
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,799
that all we did
was treat his ankle.

514
00:23:41,937 --> 00:23:44,121
All right then. Carry on.

515
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,377
When you hear hoofbeats,
think horses, not zebras, right?

516
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:53,530
Exactly, O'Malley. Exactly.

517
00:23:53,615 --> 00:23:56,283
Something tells me
you're not just worried about

518
00:23:56,385 --> 00:23:58,652
the damage to my hand.

519
00:23:58,754 --> 00:24:01,338
Phillip, earlier you were
squinting at your paperwork.

520
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,490
I keep telling him
he needs glasses.

521
00:24:03,592 --> 00:24:05,408
And your handwriting was tiny

522
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,344
and wasn't all that
legible. Is that normal?

523
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,664
Well, I've never been a straight
A student if that's what you mean.

524
00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:14,034
Is he done...? Are we done here?

525
00:24:14,136 --> 00:24:17,420
- We could both use some rest.
- Humor me for one more second.

526
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:22,092
OK. Look straight ahead.

527
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,612
Tell me when you see my fingers.

528
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:34,387
- I see them.
- Tumor!

529
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,542
Sorry.

530
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:43,279
This is nice of you. Really.

531
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,527
Dreaming up some brain
tumor to make me feel better

532
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:47,279
about the fact I
made a bear mad.

533
00:24:47,303 --> 00:24:50,120
It cross your mind I may be the
type dumb enough to pet a bear?

534
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,755
Jennifer. Is he
that type of guy?

535
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:54,625
Don't ask me, I've only
known him a few months.

536
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:57,994
Phillip, you knew better.
You touched the cub anyway.

537
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:00,164
- With your other symptoms...
- What symptoms?

538
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:02,393
My vision's going
bad, so I get glasses.

539
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,901
It's not just vision.

540
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,604
Brain tumors have been
known to impede judgment,

541
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:09,722
prompt spontaneity, impulsivity.

542
00:25:12,828 --> 00:25:15,579
He married a trashy
waitress. Right?

543
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,214
I mean, that's what you mean.

544
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:20,967
That he married a girl
like me. The rebound girl.

545
00:25:23,639 --> 00:25:27,891
I'm just saying I would like him
to have an MRI. Just to be sure.

546
00:25:31,347 --> 00:25:34,281
- Well, the answer's no.
- Do the MRI.

547
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,034
- Honey, I don't need...
- Phillip. Do the damn MRI.

548
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:40,203
Because you're wrong.

549
00:25:41,757 --> 00:25:44,557
He loves me.

550
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,094
He loves me.

551
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:54,351
Mr. Robinson is better. We
were able to DC the Levofed.

552
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:56,053
He's intermittently
awake and lucid.

553
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:58,872
His chest tube put out 100
cc's since I last saw you,

554
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,141
I'll be back in an hour
with another update.

555
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,961
- Is somebody chasing you?
- Excuse me?

556
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,345
What are you racing around for?

557
00:26:05,447 --> 00:26:06,980
Uh... uh, no reason.

558
00:26:07,082 --> 00:26:10,200
No reason. Not because you're
running towards the finish line

559
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:13,803
- of this surgical contest?
- Oh, that.

560
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,422
- Yes.
- Are you winning?

561
00:26:15,524 --> 00:26:18,541
Yes. Once I finish my
sutures on Mr. Robinson.

562
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:20,756
Too bad. I was going
to let you watch me

563
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,624
put Mrs. Witkowsky's
new valve in.

564
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:26,733
But, if a contest is more important
than a cardiac surgery, so be it.

565
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:36,794
I'd be happy to watch, Dr. Hahn.

566
00:26:39,148 --> 00:26:41,915
Crap, crap, crap,
crap, crap, crap. Crap!

567
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:45,035
- Ankle guy?
- CSF is spotless,

568
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:47,020
the ABG is normal,
the ultrasound is clear.

569
00:26:47,122 --> 00:26:49,405
What am I missing?
What am I missing?

570
00:26:52,461 --> 00:26:53,772
- Oh.
- What?

571
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:55,040
- Right there.
- Where?

572
00:26:55,064 --> 00:26:56,507
- See?
- No.

573
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,932
The fact you're doing
unnecessary medical procedures

574
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,550
to win a contest. No!

575
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:02,631
The fact you and
Meredith are both doing

576
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:06,022
- unnecessary procedures to win.
- Meredith has a medical
mystery?

577
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,053
- No, she doesn't.
- Something is wrong.

578
00:27:08,077 --> 00:27:09,560
- Know how I know?
- No.

579
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:12,062
Great doctors have that
extra instinct, George.

580
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:13,164
They just know.

581
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,766
Great doctors, they
know when to stop.

582
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:17,434
I have to have that
instinct, George.

583
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:19,920
Because my instincts
lately? Very bad.

584
00:27:20,022 --> 00:27:22,973
Really bad. They told
me to go for cardio.

585
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:25,158
They told me to have
sex with a married man.

586
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,127
- Ow.
- They are not serving me well.

587
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,796
I am in danger of going
extinct if this keeps up.

588
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,215
I am going to win this contest.

589
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:34,134
If for no other reason
than I have to win it!

590
00:27:35,337 --> 00:27:37,420
You paged me?

591
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:40,090
I thought you might
like to see this.

592
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,309
Is that bear attack guy?

593
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,945
That's bear attack guy
and his big old brain tumor.

594
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:46,947
I'm not requiring
an apology, George.

595
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:49,933
I'm not requiring an apology
because the fact I have

596
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:52,569
potentially saved a life
is reward enough for me.

597
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,405
- You're calling me in to gloat.
- No.

598
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,675
I need a favor.

599
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:05,782
- What am I at?
- Eighty-seven.

600
00:28:05,867 --> 00:28:08,818
You're an underdog,
aren't you, Karev?

601
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:10,201
Sir?

602
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:14,191
It's not that you don't have
the skills. You have the skills.

603
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:15,959
But you're scrappy.

604
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:19,463
You're a fighter. I like that.

605
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:21,014
I always root for the underdog.

606
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:25,151
I'm a fighter, but
I'm no underdog.

607
00:28:25,253 --> 00:28:28,388
Like this guy here. He
didn't provoke that bear,

608
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,557
his brother did it.

609
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:32,125
Now he's fighting for his life,

610
00:28:32,227 --> 00:28:34,128
paying for someone
else's mistakes.

611
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:37,614
Doesn't make him... an underdog.

612
00:28:37,699 --> 00:28:39,299
It just...

613
00:28:39,401 --> 00:28:41,413
Well, it makes him
have to work harder

614
00:28:41,437 --> 00:28:43,597
to overcome the
cards he got dealt.

615
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,277
No, he's crashing.
Hit that code button!

616
00:28:50,378 --> 00:28:55,565

<i>- ♪ You owe it to yourself ♪</i>

617

- Yes.

618
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,317
She didn't want to
come to me herself?

619
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:05,209

Oh, my God.

623
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,276
Honey, I'm so sorry.

624
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:26,363
We did absolutely
everything we could.

625
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:28,965
The stress was just
too much for his body.

<i>♪ Some people don't get much ♪</i>

627
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,875
There's more.

628
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:43,230
The neurosurgeon is going
to come in and talk to you.

629
00:29:43,332 --> 00:29:45,632
No. No, I need to know.

630
00:29:46,668 --> 00:29:47,984
Please.

631
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:52,889
I'm sorry. I was
right about the tumor.

632
00:29:52,974 --> 00:29:55,658
You have something
called a malignant glioma.

633
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,764
This kind of tumor
causes behavioral...

634
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:05,318
It can cause this kind
of inappropriate affect.

635
00:30:05,421 --> 00:30:08,671
- Can you operate?
- No. It's too invasive.

636
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:11,274
It's been growing a long time.

637
00:30:15,197 --> 00:30:17,213
I'm so sorry.

638
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,690
Good.

639
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:29,193
Good. I deserve that.

640
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:33,063
I killed my brother, so I
don't deserve to survive.

641
00:30:52,034 --> 00:30:53,599
Doctor.

642
00:30:56,155 --> 00:31:00,156
I'm a symptom, right? I
mean, I'm like the bear cub.

643
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,342
I'm just a symptom
of this tumor.

644
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:06,096
That's what we're saying
here, right? Just so I'm clear?

645
00:31:07,983 --> 00:31:10,267
I don't know.

646
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,369
I don't know that.

647
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:14,854
You're the only one who
can know that for sure.

648
00:31:19,928 --> 00:31:22,212
When you say negative,
do you mean as in bad,

649
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:25,699
- or as in non-existent?
- Nothing bad came up.

650
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:28,935
What about all those alphabet
tests you were railing off?

651
00:31:29,037 --> 00:31:30,804
They were elevated or something.

652
00:31:30,906 --> 00:31:32,956
Yeah. Um...

653
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,724
They were nonspecific.

654
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,393
They likely indicated that you

655
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,861
basically have a
relatively minor flu.

656
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:41,131
I have the flu?

657
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:44,517
This whole day, everything
you put me through...

658
00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:47,253
you put me through
all of this for the flu?

659
00:31:47,356 --> 00:31:48,671
I'm sorry. I am.

660
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:51,207
It just, it seemed like
there was something more.

661
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,159
It really seemed...

662
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:55,340
It's hard to see
the silver lining,

663
00:31:55,364 --> 00:31:57,275
but think of the
discoveries you made.

664
00:31:57,299 --> 00:32:00,350
About yourself and
your life and your ex-wife.

665
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:02,719
My ex-wife was
a castrating bitch!

666
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:04,354
She was a castrating bitch!

667
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:05,822
I've never missed
her for one day

668
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,742
since she left! Not until
today! And I missed her today,

669
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,210
if we were still together

670
00:32:10,312 --> 00:32:12,245
she would've shot me
dead a long time ago,

671
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,597
and I wouldn't have
gone through hell!

672
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:17,684
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to. I really...

673
00:32:17,786 --> 00:32:19,169
You treated me like a rat!

674
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,771
Like a rat in some
perverted lab!

675
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:24,107
God, just give me
my prescription!

676
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:25,492
I want to get out of here!

677
00:32:26,562 --> 00:32:27,661
The flu is a virus.

678
00:32:27,763 --> 00:32:30,630
It doesn't respond
to antibiotics.

679
00:32:30,732 --> 00:32:33,066
I suggest plenty
of fluids and rest.

680
00:32:34,469 --> 00:32:37,403
Fluids and rest? Fluid and rest?

681
00:32:37,505 --> 00:32:39,556
- I'm sorry.
- Fluids and freaking rest?

682
00:32:39,641 --> 00:32:42,893
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.

683
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:51,768
<i>Dr. Leone, call the blood bank.
Dr. Leone, call the blood bank.</i>

684
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,036
What are you doing?

685
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,672
You spent three hours
watching surgery. Three points.

686
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:57,307
I'm trusting you screwed up.

687
00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:00,293
I could still win. I could. I
did get a lot of points today.

688
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,129
What's the matter with
you? Where's the trash talk?

689
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:04,864
She knows I'm the best.

690
00:33:07,135 --> 00:33:10,686
- Who won?
- Congratulations...

691
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,405
- Who won?
- Dr. Grey.

692
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,976
Guy from the bear attack had
a brain tumor, Grey caught it.

693
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,896
80 points, solving a medical
mystery put her over the top.

694
00:33:19,981 --> 00:33:22,398
- I could have found a tumor.
- But you didn't.

695
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,351
You chose to scrub in with
Hahn and watch for three points.

696
00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:28,705
- Now, congratulate Dr. Grey.
- Congratulations.

697
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:31,624
Hey, don't you want your prize?

698
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:33,876
Ooh!

699
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:36,012
- A shiny pager.
- A sparkle pager.

700
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:39,165
- What's great about
a glitter pager?
- A sparkle pager!

701
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:42,285
It is special. It is
surgery's holy grail.

702
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,315
Passed down from
resident to resident,

703
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:45,905
now it belongs to Dr. Grey.

704
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:48,425
For three months,
whenever you get a surgery,

705
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:52,128
you have to page this pager
and if Grey wants your surgery,

706
00:33:52,213 --> 00:33:53,991
she has the right
to take it from you.

707
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:56,349
Come on! Crap.

708
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,968
Enjoy the power, Dr. Grey.

709
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:02,638
Now may I recommend
you all go home. You smell.

710
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:04,340
You're greasy.
You need to bathe.

711
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,792
I'm sick of looking at you.

712
00:34:05,894 --> 00:34:07,877
My one-year-old is
sick of looking at you.

713
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,446
Isn't that right?

714
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:12,082
Sick of looking at
your little ugly faces.

715
00:34:13,902 --> 00:34:15,602
I thought I would
enjoy this more.

716
00:34:15,704 --> 00:34:17,065
Well, give it to
me. I'll enjoy it.

717
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:19,234
Don't give it to
her. Give it to me.

718
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:21,402
Oh shut up. It's hers.
She's the winner.

719
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:23,104
She's not going
to give it to you.

720
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:25,411
Give it to me.

721
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,084
- This is crap.
- Are you kidding me?

722
00:34:33,955 --> 00:34:35,454
I don't like her.

723
00:34:35,557 --> 00:34:37,702
Sorry, but as your
friend, it's my job to say it.

724
00:34:37,726 --> 00:34:38,992
I don't like Rose.

725
00:34:39,094 --> 00:34:41,111
- Why?
- You're not sleeping with her.

726
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:44,063
You don't like her because
she's not sleeping with me?

727
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,242
That's a little weird.

728
00:34:45,266 --> 00:34:47,200
- Not weird.
- It's a little weird.

729
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,703
If you were, I could understand
why you spend time with her.

730
00:34:49,805 --> 00:34:51,204
But you're not.

731
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:54,207
It's just... I
thought that, uh...

732
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:58,445
You know, I thought it was
just going to be you and me.

733
00:34:59,214 --> 00:35:00,814
- Having sex?
- After!

734
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:02,715
After Addison, after Meredith.

735
00:35:02,817 --> 00:35:04,534
I have been patient.

736
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:07,937
I waited while you partnered
up with these chicks, they're over.

737
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,557
And it's supposed to
be just us. You and me.

738
00:35:10,659 --> 00:35:12,270
Two guys on the
prowl, on the hunt.

739
00:35:12,294 --> 00:35:14,678
Having trouble getting
laid and need my help?

740
00:35:14,763 --> 00:35:17,430
I can get laid. I can get
laid whenever I want.

741
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,583
- Uh-huh.
- I do get laid whenever I want.

742
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:20,728
That's the point.

743
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:22,852
Women are everywhere.

744
00:35:24,273 --> 00:35:27,207
I only have one
person I can talk to.

745
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,088
- That's sweet.
- Shut up.

746
00:35:30,112 --> 00:35:31,995
- It's warm and fuzzy. Sweet.
- Shut up!

747
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:35,147
Are you serious
about this woman?

748
00:35:36,852 --> 00:35:39,585
I don't know. Could be.

749
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,019
All right.

750
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:47,443
- I'll give her a chance.
- Good boy.

751
00:35:47,546 --> 00:35:50,146
You're pathetic. I'm a
lesser man for knowing you.

752
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,182
That's my line.
Can't use my line.

753
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,862
I thought you were
off duty an hour ago.

754
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:09,666
I'm just catching up
on some paperwork.

755
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:13,002
It piled up on you during
the contest, I guess.

756
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:15,839
- You know about that?
- I know about Otis Sharon

757
00:36:15,941 --> 00:36:18,458
and the $120,000 worth

758
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,226
of unnecessary
tests you ordered.

759
00:36:20,328 --> 00:36:22,729
Yeah. Well...

760
00:36:24,499 --> 00:36:26,032
I lost.

761
00:36:26,134 --> 00:36:28,296
And I put a man through
hell for no reason at all.

762
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,270
I was a bad doctor today

763
00:36:30,371 --> 00:36:33,640
with bad instincts
and I deserved to lose.

764
00:36:33,742 --> 00:36:36,275
I don't know why I even
bothered competing.

765
00:36:36,377 --> 00:36:39,862
- So, I don't need to yell?
- You should. You can.

766
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,931
But you don't need to.

767
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,217
OK.

768
00:36:46,054 --> 00:36:49,089
- Stevens?
- Yes, sir?

769
00:36:49,191 --> 00:36:52,692
My year? I lost by two points.

770
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:56,512
- You...
- You didn't invent the contest.

771
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:01,434
The contest is a lion fight.

772
00:37:01,536 --> 00:37:04,020
So chin up, put
your shoulders back.

773
00:37:04,122 --> 00:37:05,504
Walk proud. Strut a little.

774
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:08,574
Don't lick your
wounds, celebrate them.

775
00:37:08,677 --> 00:37:10,710
The scars you bear are
the sign of a competitor.

776
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,181
You were in a
lion fight, Stevens.

777
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:16,666
Just because you didn't win

778
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:19,752
doesn't mean you
don't know how to roar.

779
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,044

00:41:05,397 --> 00:41:08,213
Mr. Robinson is the man
who was mauled by the bear?

845
00:41:08,315 --> 00:41:10,867
I did all this research.
And I found this.

846
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,352
It's rare and still
untested in humans

847
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,805
but I could find
patients for a clinical trial

848
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:17,407
and I can do the labwork,

849
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:20,910
and I could track the results.
But I do need a neurosurgeon.

850
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:23,112
And you're one of the best.

851
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,831
It's not about us. I would
go somewhere else if I could.
