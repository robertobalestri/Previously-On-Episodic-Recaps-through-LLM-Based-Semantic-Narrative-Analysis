1
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:04,047
<i>- Previously on</i> Grey's
Anatomy: - I slept with Izzie.

2
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:06,088
George told me. Everything.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,957
You named me Ava and
I was more me as Ava

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:10,659
than I'll ever be as Rebecca.

5
00:00:10,727 --> 00:00:12,794
Dr. Hahn. I was
pleasantly surprised

6
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:14,579
to hear you were
joining us today.

7
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,098
You remind me of myself
when I was an intern.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,068
Focused, intense. Cold.

9
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,820
- My mother's dead, isn't she?
- Yes.

10
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:25,257
Let's do this once. I'm
fine. She's cremated.

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,725
I picked out a beautiful urn,

12
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,710
she's hanging out in
the back of my closet.

13
00:00:28,812 --> 00:00:33,265
Any more questions about my dead
mother or can we get back to work?

14
00:00:37,354 --> 00:00:40,706
Pick me. Choose me. Love me.

15
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:44,927
You're the love of my
life. I can't leave you.

16
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:47,779
But you're
constantly leaving me.

17
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,966
Imagine my disappointment
when I wake up after five years

18
00:00:51,068 --> 00:00:53,902
and discover that you're
no more than ordinary!

19
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:02,127
<i>There's a reason surgeons
learn to wield scalpels.</i>

20
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:06,465
<i>We like to pretend we're
hard, cold scientists.</i>

21
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:09,384
<i>We like to pretend
we're fearless.</i>

22
00:01:10,453 --> 00:01:16,408
Pick me. Choose me. Love me.

23
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,996
<i>But the truth is we become surgeons
because somewhere, deep down,</i>

24
00:01:21,098 --> 00:01:25,099
<i>we think we can cut
away that which haunts us.</i>

25
00:01:27,604 --> 00:01:30,572
- What are you guys doing up?
- Couldn't sleep.

26
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,174
<i>Weakness.</i>

27
00:01:32,276 --> 00:01:34,008
<i>Frailty.</i>

28
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,810
<i>Death.</i>

29
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,022
What is that?

30
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,893
My mother.

31
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,930
Happy freaking Halloween.

32
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,690
Yang.

33
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,926
You're moving out
of Burke's place?

34
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:09,794
Yes, sir.

35
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,781
My wife has filed for divorce.

36
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:15,534
I'm very sorry, sir.

37
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,669
At any rate, I need
a place to live.

38
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:20,421
And Burke's place,
I was there once.

39
00:02:20,523 --> 00:02:22,357
I suppose actually
it's your place now.

40
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:24,893
No. It's still Burke's place.

41
00:02:28,364 --> 00:02:29,798
Now, it's yours.

42
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,775
What are we looking at?

43
00:02:40,877 --> 00:02:44,346
Meredith put her mom in a
baggie and brought her to work.

44
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:47,365
I had to get her out of my
closet. She was haunting me.

45
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,618
And now she's haunting us all.

46
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:52,571
- I'm putting her to rest.
- Meredith is cleansing.

47
00:02:52,656 --> 00:02:55,474
In tribal culture when one
wants to cleanse the past,

48
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:58,459
one cuts off all of one's
hair and buries it in the earth.

49
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:00,678
You might try that too.

50
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,082
OK. Listen up.
Today's a holiday,

51
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:05,978
which means the
pit will be overrun.

52
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:08,162
You've got the usual
drunken stupidity.

53
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,233
And then you've
got Seattle's annual

54
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,468
chainsaw pumpkin
carving contest.

55
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,559
- I love this city.
- Stay on your toes,

56
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:15,978
stay on top of your interns, OK?

57
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,029
So we should
round before the pit?

58
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,948
Direct your questions
to Dr. Bailey, Stevens.

59
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,052
Oh, we're directing our
questions to Dr. Bailey?

60
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:25,637
Oh, not you. Just Stevens.

61
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,923
Why is Stevens directing
her questions to Dr. Bailey?

62
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:31,994
Because she's been
sleeping with my husband.

63
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:39,651
Alrighty, then. Have a good day.

64
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:53,147
OK, this is even more disturbing
than your bag full of mommy.

65
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:55,450
His medication was
due half an hour ago.

66
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:58,570
The man is living in the
hospital while he waits on a heart.

67
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:01,622
Erin, honey, I'm
thinking it's kind of hard

68
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:05,026
for anyone to take you
seriously in your mouse costume.

69
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:07,779
See, I work with
five-year-olds, Dad.

70
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:10,949
My costume is
appropriate. Hers is not.

71
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:15,003
Look, I'm just saying if you have
time for Halloween costumes,

72
00:04:15,105 --> 00:04:18,272
you probably have time to
provide my father with basic care.

73
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:22,427
Hi. I'm Dr. O'Malley. I will take
care of your father right away.

74
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,429
Thank you.

75
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,812
You should always make
sure they have their meds

76
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,578
before you do anything else.

77
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,669
- There you go.
- Thanks.

78
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,105
- I like your costume.
- Oh.

79
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:34,573
Well, Dr. Yang said that...

80
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,208
Dr. Yang is screwing with you.

81
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:42,197
Oh! I knew it.

82
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,800
- Are you the doctor?
- Oh. I am.

83
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:49,370
Good. That's... That's good.

84
00:04:50,073 --> 00:04:51,639
Is your leg hurting you?

85
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:54,609
It's not the leg, it's the foot.

86
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:59,464
And it's not hurting so
much as it's not mine.

87
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,811
Something happened.
I can't explain it,

88
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,535
but this foot does
not belong to me.

89
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,888
It's...

90
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,209
It... It... Well, it feels
like it's a corpse foot.

91
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,628
Did you lose feeling
in the foot? Is it numb?

92
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,698
No, it's not numb. It's just...

93
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,015
It's not mine.

94
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,635
Please. I'm not crazy.

95
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,971
I work in a bank.
I'm not crazy. Please.

96
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,538
I just... I need a surgeon.

97
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:28,810
I need you to get me a
surgeon who will remove it.

98
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,912
A surgeon who will
remove your foot?

99
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:36,968
A surgeon who will amputate
your seemingly healthy foot?

100
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:44,542
- Oh!
- Whoa!

101
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,548
- What is that?
- It's charts.

102
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,277
- Meredith?
- It's my mom.

103
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:52,861
- What?
- Had her in the cubby

104
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,252
and she was freaking people out

105
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,032
so I was gonna
put her in the car.

106
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,773
Think that's disrespectful?
To leave her in the car?

107
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,875
- Just a little...
- It's not that strange.

108
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,911
- Well...
- I'm trying to figure out

109
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:04,190
how to put her to rest.

110
00:06:04,214 --> 00:06:06,374
I can't shove her in
my closet anymore.

111
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,693
I have to deal with her.

112
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:11,786
- Well...
- And this is me... trying to evolve.

113
00:06:11,888 --> 00:06:15,307
I'm trying here.
So, cubby or car?

114
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:18,743
You're asking me if I think you
should put your mom's ashes

115
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,478
in your cubby or your car? OK.

116
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:22,714
And you don't think
that's very, very strange?

117
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,100
Are those really
your mom's ashes?

118
00:06:25,202 --> 00:06:27,602
It's strange,
right? It's strange.

119
00:06:27,704 --> 00:06:31,505
- Are you lost?
- No. My mom works
in the cafeteria.

120
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:34,075
She said I could come up
here and look for Dr. Sloan?

121
00:06:34,177 --> 00:06:35,438
Do you know him?

122
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,178
Um... can you take care of him?

123
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,832
Yeah. Can you take care of her?

124
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,007
Good morning.

125
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,910
- Don't do that. Don't smile at me.
- Don't smile at her.

126
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,062
- Don't smile at me either.
- We're on to you.

127
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,748
- We've compared notes.
- Compared notes. Really?

128
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,502
Mm-hmm. Compared notes,
pick-up lines, techniques.

129
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,971
- Techniques?
- Identical.

130
00:07:03,072 --> 00:07:05,673
- Identical?
- We've formed a club.

131
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:08,342
"Nurses United
Against Mark Sloan."

132
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:13,915
Are there any,
uh... club activities?

133
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,889
Oh, man. You would not
believe what just happened to me.

134
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:23,958
- There's a... kid looking for you.
- What?

135
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:28,479
- Daddy?
- What?

136
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:33,751
- Nicely done.
- Thanks.

137
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,771
- I'll be getting
you back for that.
- Looking forward to it.

138
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,658
You're not my father.

139
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,093
But I am hoping you'll
build me some ears.

140
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:47,265
Dr. Karev? Request
for you. Curtain three.

141
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:50,135
Dr. Karev? I'm feeling a
little under the weather.

142
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,004
And rather than risk
spreading germs to the patients,

143
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,338
I thought I'd head home.

144
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,786
Do you want to be a surgeon
or do you want to go to bed?

145
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,788
One or the other.
Surgeons stand up

146
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,589
through ten, 12,
15-hour surgeries.

147
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,848
Without food. Without bathroom
breaks. Without complaints.

148
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,318
Surgeons do not go home because
we have a tickle in our throat.

149
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,872
Not a tickle in my
throat as much as...

150
00:08:10,974 --> 00:08:14,041
- Make yourself busy, Norman.
- Right.

151
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:23,818
All the moms in my town,
they all dress up for Halloween.

152
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,021
So I was thinking,
what would I want to be?

153
00:08:27,124 --> 00:08:29,168
If I had to dress
up, what would I...?

154
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:32,777
And the only thing I
could come up with,

155
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,048
the only thing that I
wanted to be... was Ava.

156
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:41,452
<i>♪ But I need your
little shining light ♪</i>

157
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:52,713
<i>♪ You promised the world
Opened up your door ♪</i>

158
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:59,604
<i>♪ And the words you fed
me left me wanting more ♪</i>

159
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,541
You found him.

160
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,878
You two know each other?
You know his parents?

161
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,147
His mom works in the
cafeteria. What's all this?

162
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,294
Letters from the
kids in my class.

163
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,718
Letters to me.

164
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,887
He has the internal
structure to hear.

165
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,940
He just doesn't have the
canal or the external structure.

166
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:21,492
So I thought if I came
in with my letters,

167
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,829
Dr. Sloan might feel sorry for
me and do the surgery for free.

168
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,131
Uh, look, I'd like to help.

169
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,333
I would if I could, but
pro bono surgery...

170
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:31,146
You should know
that on my way here

171
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,672
three different people
thought I was in a costume.

172
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:37,692
My head looks like a
permanent Halloween costume.

173
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:42,480
- Just thought
you should know that.
- You're good.

174
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,167
Pro bono surgery's not just
about me giving you my time.

175
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:49,704
A surgery like this requires
OR time, an anesthesiologist,

176
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:52,690
a general surgeon to remove
the cartilage from your ribs,

177
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:57,846
- at least two surgical nurses.
- Couldn't you
ask them for help?

178
00:09:57,947 --> 00:10:00,865
I could. But I don't
have any social capital.

179
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:04,602
The nurses hate me. They've
formed a club that's all about hating me.

180
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,938
And the other doctors
don't owe me any favors

181
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,557
because I've never
done any for them.

182
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:12,660
I'm sorry. I wish I could help.

183
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:15,813
I would if I could.

184
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,318
I have social capital.

185
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,088
Or, I don't. Nobody knows me,

186
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,469
but they knew my mother.

187
00:10:24,508 --> 00:10:26,190
So maybe I can make this happen.

188
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:30,278
Fine. Make it happen. You
manage that, I'm all yours.

189
00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:34,765
These people who
knew your mother...

190
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:37,318
Do they know you brought
her to work in a baggie?

191
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:50,247
Oh. You... You...

192
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:54,251
You didn't come for me! You...

193
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:56,854
You chickened out.

194
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:00,858
When I... When I was
leaving. When I was...

195
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,072
When I asked you to
give me a reason to stay,

196
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,940
you chickened out. Which I get.

197
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,364
I get that. It was a lot.

198
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,779
It was scary. And I know
it can be kind of intense,

199
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:13,137
but I thought-I thought... Oh.

200
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:17,875
I thought after the
chickening out part, I thought...

201
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,144
you would come for me.

202
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:27,485
I came back for you. Which
basically makes me a beggar.

203
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:30,188
I'm a beggar for Halloween.

204
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,824
- And now you're mocking me.
- I'm not mocking you.

205
00:11:42,352 --> 00:11:44,852
We need to talk.

206
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,554
We will.

207
00:11:48,658 --> 00:11:50,375
Body Dysmorphic Disorder?

208
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,704
You can prescribe
some anti-anxiety meds,

209
00:11:52,728 --> 00:11:55,163
to try to lessen the
urgency he's feeling.

210
00:11:55,265 --> 00:11:57,999
The man is requesting
an amputation

211
00:11:58,101 --> 00:12:01,369
and the best you can come
up with is anti-anxiety meds?

212
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:03,637
Dr. Bailey?

213
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,891
- Chainsaw contest time?
- Yep.

214
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,478
- Mr. Miller.
- Duquette Clinic.

215
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,879
I have to get to the ER,

216
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,715
but I'm going to write
you a prescription

217
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,750
for some medication
I think may help you.

218
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:19,387
Medication? I need...
I need a surgeon.

219
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,724
A surgeon can take off
the foot. Get me a surgeon!

220
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:25,426
I am a surgeon! And I
can tell you right now

221
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:29,230
that you won't persuade me or any
other surgeon to do what you're asking.

222
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,465
Please, try this medication.

223
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:35,936
I have an earless boy.

224
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,022
I'm sorry?

225
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:41,141
Sloan has agreed to
build him ears pro bono.

226
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:44,044
If you will donate the
OR and all the equipment.

227
00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:48,716
I'm sorry, my pro bono slate is full,
there are protocols to be followed,

228
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:51,552
- all sorts of red tape...
- Trick or treat.

229
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:55,807
Get it? He's trick
or treating. For ears.

230
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,159
- Grey...
- You know, my mother...

231
00:12:59,262 --> 00:13:01,645
She was big on
pro bono surgeries.

232
00:13:06,436 --> 00:13:08,987
OR two is free at 6:00pm.

233
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,905
Thank you.

234
00:13:15,612 --> 00:13:18,007
If you two need to talk
I could wait over there.

235
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:20,748
Why? It's not like we
have any secrets anymore.

236
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,517
Callie told everyone. Everyone.

237
00:13:22,618 --> 00:13:24,664
Yeah. It's going
to be a long day.

238
00:13:24,688 --> 00:13:28,873
Erin Shanley, 34, massive head trauma,
a brick came through her windshield.

239
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,009
- GCS of three.
- Brick through her windshield?

240
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,711
Kids screwing around on
a bridge. Halloween crap.

241
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,331
- I'm looking at brain matter.
- - I checked, she's a donor.

242
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:39,333
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.

243
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:41,402
- What?
- Her father's on three.

244
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:43,605
He's waiting for a new heart.

245
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:46,825
It was awesome.

246
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:49,510
It was the sickest pumpkin
head you ever saw.

247
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:50,790
Mm-hmm.

248
00:13:50,814 --> 00:13:53,247
The next thing you know
it's like, blood gushing

249
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:55,433
and it totally stained
my pumpkin head.

250
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:58,168
- You don't say.
- Made it even sicker, though.

251
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,822
- I brought it in. The digit.
- Oh, you have the finger?

252
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:05,292
Yeah, but it's like,
lodged in the chainsaw.

253
00:14:05,394 --> 00:14:08,863
Wait. It was right here.
Who took my saw?

254
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:11,405
Sir, the cut isn't clean
enough to consider...

255
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:14,168
Yo! Who took my saw?

256
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:21,726
Oh. Oh, no.

257
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:25,162
- What is that noise?
- I have no idea.

258
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:34,439
Dude, sick!

259
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,977
The tibial nerve is shot.
There's nothing salvageable here.

260
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,262
Completely mangled.

261
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:43,814
Can't believe he held that
saw to his leg long enough...

262
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:46,612
- Was he high?
- No. Gave him some
morphine for the pain,

263
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,914
but tox screen was
clean before that.

264
00:14:48,938 --> 00:14:50,588
Unbelievable.

265
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,190
All right. I'll finish the job.

266
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:55,276
Yang, go ahead and prep
him for complete amputation.

267
00:14:55,378 --> 00:14:59,080
Thank you. Thank you so much.

268
00:14:59,883 --> 00:15:01,160
Hey, you OK?

269
00:15:01,184 --> 00:15:03,317
Severed limbs
don't sit well with me.

270
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:06,871
Just a little queasy is all.
No, I'm fine. I'll help Dr.Yang.

271
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,407
OK.

272
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,294
Got to love Halloween.

273
00:15:13,396 --> 00:15:15,914
When all the crazies
come out to play.

274
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:19,183
I kind of get it. I mean, I get
that you can wake up one day

275
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:21,402
and your life doesn't
feel like your own.

276
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:25,590
I heard. About your marriage.

277
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:28,059
And if there's anything
you need me to do

278
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,745
to cheer you up, I'm around.

279
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:33,314
Day or night.

280
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,049
Night in particular.

281
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:36,967
I was married.

282
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,704
I said "Till death do us
part." OK, in a church.

283
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:43,007
I mean, it was the Church of
Elvis, but still it was a church.

284
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:47,345
I just... I can't
believe this is my life.

285
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:54,318
I don't understand. How did this
happen? How could this happen?

286
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:59,673
Injuries like these
happen very quickly.

287
00:15:59,776 --> 00:16:02,626
She probably didn't
feel any pain at all.

288
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,830
Mr. Shanley...

289
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:11,068
According to Erin's driver's
license, she was an organ donor.

290
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,372
And as next of kin,

291
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,226
if you agree to take
her off of life-support,

292
00:16:19,328 --> 00:16:22,647
you can direct the
heart to yourself.

293
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:28,436
She is young, she was healthy.

294
00:16:28,538 --> 00:16:30,571
She would be a perfect
match for you, sir.

295
00:16:30,673 --> 00:16:32,423
Could you just please go away?

296
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:36,910
- Mr. Shanley, if you would...
- Please. Please go away. Please.

297
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,966
Dr. O'Malley will bring
you to see your daughter.

298
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,668
If you'd like.

299
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:56,830
- Oh, so sorry. Excuse me. Are you OK?
- No. No apology necessary.

300
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,784
I'm Sydney. Dr. Sydney
Heron. General surgery.

301
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:01,169
Big fan of your work. Yeah.

302
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,337
We were seated
together once at an M & M.

303
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,671
Anyway.

304
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:07,307
Now seems as good as
time as any to make it official.

305
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,177
- Our introduction.
- Derek Shepherd. Pleasure.

306
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,945
It's very, very
nice to meet you.

307
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:14,632
Nice meeting you too.

308
00:17:18,654 --> 00:17:22,390
- You think she's pretty?
- Yeah. I like cheerful people.

309
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:23,691
I can be cheerful.

310
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,577
I think the ashes thing
makes that kind of unlikely.

311
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,548
Dr. Bailey? We're going to help

312
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,350
rebuild a little boy's
ears today, pro bono,

313
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:36,370
and I thought maybe you
could donate some time.

314
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,506
Thanks to the fine
upstanding citizen

315
00:17:38,608 --> 00:17:40,374
who cut off his
foot on my watch,

316
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,393
I've got a mountain
of paperwork.

317
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:45,596
On top of that, I promised to
try and get out of here in time

318
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:47,665
to see my son in his
Halloween costume.

319
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,351
Is Tuck even old enough
to know what Halloween is?

320
00:17:50,453 --> 00:17:54,388
He's not, but his father is,
and that's who I promised.

321
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,057
Trick or treat!

322
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,830
For ears? He's trick
or treating for ears?

323
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,333
Yeah. Could you also persuade

324
00:18:06,435 --> 00:18:08,936
some of the surgical
nurses to help out?

325
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:11,855
They seem to really like you.

326
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,308
- Trick or treat.
- Stop that.

327
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,495
All right. I'm in.

328
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,908
She's warm. It
doesn't make sense.

329
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,193
I'm sorry.

330
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:36,964
She's breathing with
the help of machines.

331
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:42,636
Erin, the person that you
knew, isn't there anymore.

332
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:54,165
Um, would you
bring this paperwork?

333
00:18:54,684 --> 00:18:56,350
Mm-hmm.

334
00:18:56,452 --> 00:18:57,951
You can have her.

335
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:01,922
You can have her organs.
That's what she wanted.

336
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:04,074
And her heart?

337
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:09,630
Give it to someone else.

338
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:15,770
You could scatter
her off the roof.

339
00:19:15,872 --> 00:19:17,655
She was afraid of heights.

340
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:21,908
They're ashes, Meredith.
The ashes aren't acrophobic.

341
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:25,329
I need to put my mother to
rest. I need to not become her.

342
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:27,965
I need to not die emotionally
crippled and alone.

343
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,701
And I need to not
attend the wedding

344
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,931
of Derek Shepherd
and Sydney Heron.

345
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:35,122
I need to put my mother to rest.

346
00:19:35,224 --> 00:19:36,323
Sydney Heron?

347
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,373
Just ask.

348
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,478
- So, you two are together?
- Yeah.

349
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,863
Like, together-together?

350
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:02,567
In love together? Sexy
love, not sibling love.

351
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:06,020
Yes. Yeah. We're together.

352
00:20:06,923 --> 00:20:09,806
And you two have been...

353
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,886
I mean, without
any of us knowing...

354
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,122
doing this the whole time?

355
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,746
- Just once.
- Iz.

356
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,998
I said she could ask questions.

357
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:21,218
Just once.

358
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,156
And now we're
waiting to be together.

359
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:27,541
- Out of respect.
- For Callie's feelings.

360
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,434
- She's not judging.
- Right.

361
00:20:41,924 --> 00:20:44,925
I have an earless
boy waiting for me.

362
00:20:45,027 --> 00:20:49,713
But... I'm happy for you guys.

363
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,859
- Norman.
- Do you have to go?

364
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:06,029
No. Norman can get by for a
few more minutes without me.

365
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,284
How are you? I mean,
how have you been?

366
00:21:11,386 --> 00:21:16,106
I'm in love with my daughter.
She's perfect. She's...

367
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,175
She sucks on her fingers...

368
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:21,078
It's her new thing...
and she makes like this,

369
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,915
perfect little cartoon
suckling sound.

370
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:27,434
And your husband?

371
00:21:29,304 --> 00:21:32,439
My husband's in love
with my daughter too.

372
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:39,813
- You look tired.
- I haven't been sleeping much.

373
00:21:39,915 --> 00:21:42,027
I haven't been
sleeping much either.

374
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,051
The baby wakes up all the time.

375
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,299
Not as much now
that I figured out

376
00:21:47,323 --> 00:21:50,073
that if I wrap her in
whatever shirt I'm wearing...

377
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:52,692
Hmm. She smells you. Yeah.

378
00:21:52,795 --> 00:21:55,695
Yeah. She sleeps.

379
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:00,534
Alex, what are we doing?

380
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:03,620
I mean, what are we going to do?

381
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:05,790
Hmm.

382
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,385
Dr. Hahn. Thank you for
coming on such short notice.

383
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:22,857
Oh, not a problem. Are we harvesting the
heart for UNOS or is the recipient here?

384
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:26,510
I'm hoping the recipient is
here, but he hasn't agreed yet.

385
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:31,148
I've never had much trouble talking
a heart patient into taking a heart.

386
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,553
- It's his daughter's heart.
- OK.

387
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:39,423
- Get him to OR two
and page Torres.
- OK. Where are you going?

388
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:43,077
- Hey. What's Hahn doing here?
- She's been declared
brain dead.

389
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:45,295
Heart transplant. Don't
even think about it.

390
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:47,047
- It's my patient.
- Dr. Hahn.

391
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:48,682
You're doing a heart transplant,

392
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,517
I thought I'd
volunteer to scrub in.

393
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,136
Isobel Stevens. She's
my patient, the donor.

394
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,656
So if you need any
information, I have it. All of it.

395
00:22:55,758 --> 00:22:57,090
She's my patient.

396
00:22:57,192 --> 00:23:00,393
You've got some eager
junior residents around here.

397
00:23:00,496 --> 00:23:01,995
Lucky me.

398
00:23:02,097 --> 00:23:03,697
Take your pick.

399
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,935
Well, Yang, I appreciate
the offer, but I date men.

400
00:23:08,037 --> 00:23:09,797
So I don't think
you'll impress me

401
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,456
the way you've impressed
your mentors in the past.

402
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,508
I... What?

403
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:18,962
You sleep with them, right? Preston
Burke, Colin Marlowe. That's your thing?

404
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,915
It's my... It's... I'm...

405
00:23:22,018 --> 00:23:25,002
I'm sorry... What does that
have to do with anything?

406
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:28,072
My theory is, if you
had the chops in the OR,

407
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:31,391
you wouldn't need to try
to impress in the bedroom.

408
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,277
- Stevens, is it?
- It is.

409
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:35,045
Let's go, Stevens.

410
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,486
Well, I bust my ass here,

411
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,255
Burke skips town with
my cardio reputation...

412
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,940
So instead of a
heart transplant,

413
00:23:47,043 --> 00:23:48,923
I get to participate
in the amputation

414
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,455
- of a crazy man's foot.
- I'm not...

415
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:53,363
Crazy. Cutting off
your foot is crazy.

416
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,782
Walking through your
life like you have no power,

417
00:23:55,884 --> 00:23:57,518
like you have no say...

418
00:23:57,619 --> 00:23:59,769
No say in your own destiny.

419
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,639
Like you have no control
over your own body.

420
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:06,126
Walking through life
like that is what's crazy.

421
00:24:07,396 --> 00:24:09,508
I still think it's
cutting off your foot

422
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:11,198
with a chainsaw that's crazy.

423
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:17,254
Mr. Shanley, I'm Dr. Hahn.

424
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:22,659
The transplant team is in place
if you're ready to say goodbye.

425
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,848
- You must not have children.
- I'm sorry?

426
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,384
If you had children,
you'd never say that.

427
00:24:30,486 --> 00:24:33,320
You'd never say, "If you're
ready to say goodbye."

428
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,641
Mr. Shanley, I'm very sorry.

429
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:42,479
- But I want to suggest
one last time...
- No! I'm not taking her heart.

430
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:45,415
I can't have my daughter's
heart beating in my chest.

431
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,884
It would haunt me
every day of my life. No!

432
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:52,973
All right. I'm very
sorry for your loss.

433
00:24:54,944 --> 00:24:57,077
Page me when he's ready.

434
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,402
Mr. Shanley?

435
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:09,089
I don't have kids, so I don't
know what it's like to lose a child,

436
00:25:09,191 --> 00:25:12,109
but I do know what
it's like to lose a parent.

437
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,812
Your daughter loved
you. I saw her this morning.

438
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:16,881
She was fighting for you.

439
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:20,017
She was fighting for your life.

440
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,369
You're her dad.

441
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:25,121
You're her dad... she
didn't want to leave you.

442
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:27,074
I know that.

443
00:25:27,176 --> 00:25:31,045
I also know that she would
want you to have her heart.

444
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:40,587
I would've given my
dad my heart if I could.

445
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:46,326
If I could have saved him...

446
00:25:46,428 --> 00:25:49,346
I would have given him my heart.

447
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:06,329
All right.

448
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,439
- It's not my fault
Hahn chose me.
- Whatever.

449
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,575
I can't believe that
you are judging me.

450
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:20,427
After what Hahn said to
you, that you are judging me.

451
00:26:20,529 --> 00:26:23,330
- It's not the same thing.
- It is the same thing.

452
00:26:23,432 --> 00:26:26,300
It's exactly the same thing.

453
00:26:26,402 --> 00:26:29,836
I'm sorry that I hurt Callie.
I didn't mean to hurt her.

454
00:26:29,938 --> 00:26:33,139
You slept with her husband.
I slept with my boyfriend.

455
00:26:33,242 --> 00:26:34,574
It's not the same thing.

456
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:38,144
Meredith slept with
another woman's husband.

457
00:26:38,246 --> 00:26:41,047
Meredith slept with
another woman's husband!

458
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:43,366
The two of you are
like this closed circle.

459
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:47,471
You can commit whatever crime you
want, in your little circle, it's all fine.

460
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:51,742
I... I know that you didn't
sleep with Burke to get ahead.

461
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:55,762
And if Hahn had asked
me, I would've defended you.

462
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,931
I'm not even asking
you to defend me.

463
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,751
I'm asking you to just
cut me an inch of slack.

464
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:05,439
And believe me when I say
that I am sorry I hurt Callie.

465
00:27:07,176 --> 00:27:08,992
We are not a closed circle.

466
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,613
You are.

467
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,100
- Dr. Shepherd.
- Yes.

468
00:27:20,189 --> 00:27:22,956
Were there actual
shepherds in your lineage?

469
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,338
I'm sorry, what?

470
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:27,327
Shepherds, ones who watch
over sheep. I'm into genealogy.

471
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:29,963
My name, for example,
not actually after the bird.

472
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,709
I'm sorry. Would you excuse me?

473
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,967
- Of course.
- OK. Thank you.

474
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,969
- You did this.
- Payback's a bitch.

475
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:39,473
- What the hell'd you tell her?
- I put the word out
that you're lookin'.

476
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,558
- That I'm looking?
- Lookin'.

477
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,228
- Sounds dirtier without the G.
- You wonder why
they formed a club?

478
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,315
- You heard about that?
- Yeah.

479
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,118
OK. So we have
one plastic surgeon.

480
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,720
A general surgeon.
An anesthesiologist.

481
00:27:53,822 --> 00:27:57,724
One, two, three scrub
nurses. And an OR.

482
00:27:57,826 --> 00:28:01,261
Let's call your mom, kid.
You're going to get some ears.

483
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:11,254
- He cut off his foot.
- Yeah.

484
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:15,425
- He cut off his
perfectly good foot.
- People do some strange things.

485
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:19,797
Well, I had the world's
shortest marriage.

486
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,547
I was left in a church.

487
00:28:23,636 --> 00:28:25,997
While I was literally
wearing a wedding dress.

488
00:28:26,021 --> 00:28:27,053
Hmm.

489
00:28:32,394 --> 00:28:35,762
George cheated on me, right
in front of me. And I missed it.

490
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:42,052
Burke sent his mother
to say goodbye to me.

491
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:46,206
- I'm going to be a divorcee!
- Now Erica Hahn
thinks I'm a fraud.

492
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:49,442
I... I'm not feeling very...

493
00:28:51,547 --> 00:28:54,064
- Norman!
- Norman?

494
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:08,528
- Oh, crap.
- Hmm? What?

495
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:13,583
My intern... something
happened. I don't know what.

496
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:17,537
- We need to talk.
- We will. I'll come back, OK?

497
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,673
OK.

498
00:29:21,577 --> 00:29:23,276
Don't chicken out.

499
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:27,764
You know, I'm impressed.

500
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,911
I didn't think
you'd pull this off.

501
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,902
I'm actually pretty
surprised myself.

502
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:34,705
Considering this was my
first time trick or treating.

503
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:36,287
- Your first time?
- Yeah.

504
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,124
My mom never made
it home to take me.

505
00:29:38,226 --> 00:29:41,127
Never got it together
to make me a costume.

506
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:42,662
Plus she said it was rude

507
00:29:42,765 --> 00:29:45,365
to knock on people's
doors and beg for food.

508
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:47,767
Huh.

509
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,991
- What?
- Just...

510
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:59,046
The apple fell pretty
far from the tree, huh?

511
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:18,148
- Dr. Karev? You want to slow down?
- Yeah. I just heard.

512
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,694
- Did he have a stroke?
- He did.

513
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:22,602
Three inches to the
left, he'd never talk again.

514
00:30:22,704 --> 00:30:24,544
Yeah, but he's
going to be OK, right?

515
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:27,374
No way to know until we get
the clot out and he wakes up.

516
00:30:27,475 --> 00:30:30,577
- But he's going to be OK?
- Karev, stop talking.

517
00:30:43,158 --> 00:30:45,692
Is your marriage really over?

518
00:30:46,495 --> 00:30:48,027
Yeah.

519
00:30:49,064 --> 00:30:51,731
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

520
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:55,902
Did Meredith really bring
her mom's ashes to work?

521

Not a bad day's work.

527
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,868
Paddles.

528
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,641
Let's see what we've got.

529
00:31:41,449 --> 00:31:43,066
There it is.

530
00:31:48,957 --> 00:31:50,757
There it is.

531
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:53,993
Come on, Norman. Come on, man.

532
00:31:54,095 --> 00:31:56,162
Come on, come on, come on.

533
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:01,735
What happened?

534
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,061
I just saw a heart transplant.

535
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:14,064
I just helped build a
little boy some ears.

536
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,866
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

537
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:20,070
I dug up my mom's cat.

538
00:32:21,307 --> 00:32:22,940
What?

539
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:25,759
My mom didn't
leave any instructions

540
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:29,145
because it was so unexpected.

541
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:33,183
So we had to figure out on our
own what she would have wanted.

542
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:36,452
And my mom loved that cat.

543
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:39,622
So I dug her up. The cat.

544
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,225
From her little grave
in our back yard.

545
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:45,945
And I snuck into the cemetery
in the middle of the night

546
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,881
and reburied her
right beside my mom.

547
00:32:48,983 --> 00:32:53,153
And it was creepy and morbid

548
00:32:53,255 --> 00:32:55,888
carrying around a
dead, decaying cat

549
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,223
through the cemetery

550
00:32:57,325 --> 00:33:01,461
in the middle of
the night. But...

551
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:04,580
it made my mom really happy.

552
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:08,185
At least, I like
to think it did.

553
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:14,040
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

554
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:21,247
Look, Tucker, I said
I'm sorry. No, I didn't...

555
00:33:22,184 --> 00:33:23,916
No, I...

556
00:33:25,454 --> 00:33:27,187
Tucker.

557
00:33:30,858 --> 00:33:32,525
Perfect.

558
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:40,066
Hi.

559
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:51,144
We just put a man's
daughter's heart in his chest.

560
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:53,663
- His daughter's heart?
- Mm-hmm.

561
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:57,016
Well, that just makes you
want to throw up, now doesn't it?

562
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,555
You all right?

563
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,056
You're Dr. Bailey.
You hear everything.

564
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,816
And even if you haven't heard
everything, I'm sure you've heard...

565
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:15,719
About your marriage?
Yeah, I probably would've.

566
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:20,256
I'm sorry.

567
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:24,761
If I... disappointed you.

568
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:26,379
I'm not your mother, O'Malley.

569
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,465
Oh... Oh.

570
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:33,236
Oh, I have to apologize
to her now too.

571
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,607
O'Malley.

572
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:42,028
Look, you're not a bad guy.

573
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:47,000
I don't mean to let you off the hook
entirely because what you did was unkind

574
00:34:47,102 --> 00:34:52,722
and hurtful and wrong.
But you're not a bad guy.

575
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:56,276
I'm just saying it takes two.

576
00:34:56,378 --> 00:35:02,098
To reach the point you reached
in your marriage, it takes two.

577
00:35:03,451 --> 00:35:06,452
I mean... I mean, I'm here,
late at night, Halloween,

578
00:35:06,555 --> 00:35:09,755
helping an earless boy get ears

579
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:13,159
and my husband wants to act
like that isn't an important thing.

580
00:35:13,261 --> 00:35:18,315
He wants to act like it isn't
a good thing that I did today.

581
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:19,916
Now that isn't just on me.

582
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:23,120
That's him wanting things
to be the way he wants.

583
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:26,923
That's him wanting things
to be purely black and white.

584
00:35:28,494 --> 00:35:33,663
I mean, I missed my
son's first Halloween.

585
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:36,466
And my heart is aching
inside of my chest but,

586
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:38,935
you know, that
doesn't mean anything.

587
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:42,905
That doesn't count. Because
in a black and white world,

588
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:44,874
I simply didn't make it home.

589
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,493
And that makes me
the bad guy. Always.

590
00:35:47,596 --> 00:35:52,065
I'm always the bad guy.
You hear what I'm saying...

591
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:02,192
I'm sorry you missed
your son's first Halloween.

592
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:08,014
Look, what I'm
saying to you is...

593
00:36:08,116 --> 00:36:13,803
OK, I was there. OK, I was
there the day your father died,

594
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:20,110
I was there when you came back
from Vegas married after a week and...

595
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:27,517
All I'm saying is, it's
not black and white.

596
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:30,303
And you're not a bad guy.

597
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:42,265
<i>Nurse Kruger to the OR.
Nurse Kruger to the OR.</i>

598
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,636
I did not sleep
my way to the top.

599
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:49,138
I'm attracted to talent
that resembles my own.

600
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,024
Not that it's any
of your business.

601
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:54,044
Your comments were
unprofessional and inappropriate.

602
00:36:54,146 --> 00:36:57,480
You know what? You're
inappropriate and unprofessional.

603
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,067
This is going to be so much fun.

604
00:37:01,169 --> 00:37:03,636
Dr. Yang. Did you hear?

605
00:37:03,738 --> 00:37:08,291
Dr. Hahn has agreed to become our
new head of cardiothoracic surgery.

606
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:12,829
Looking forward to it, Dr. Yang.

607
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,700
You can't have my apartment.

608
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:25,841
I'm sorry I didn't listen when
you said you weren't feeling well.

609
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:29,045
I'm sorry I didn't
answer your page.

610
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:31,998
- Do you know why
I chose surgery?
- No.

611
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,367
I'm a little south of sixty. And
blood makes me squeamish.

612
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:38,304
See, I wanted to go into
psych because I like to talk.

613
00:37:38,407 --> 00:37:42,092
- I've noticed that.
- But I had this voice
in my head,

614
00:37:42,194 --> 00:37:44,660
telling me to choose surgery.

615
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:49,615
It was as if my Mary Beth
was whispering in my ear.

616
00:37:51,219 --> 00:37:54,620
And so I listened. And do
you know what I think now?

617
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,789
No.

618
00:37:56,891 --> 00:38:00,993
I think I was about to
have a massive stroke.

619
00:38:01,096 --> 00:38:05,331
And my Mary Beth wanted
me to be surrounded by...

620
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:08,735
world-class surgeons
when it happened.

621
00:38:11,138 --> 00:38:12,605
Mmm.

622
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,285
So what are you going to do now?

623
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:16,493
Well, I'm going
to go into psych.

624
00:38:16,595 --> 00:38:18,528
Because you
people... you surgeons?

625
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,163
My... You're all just a
bunch of little children

626
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:24,733
running around with your scalpels
and your severed feet and your...

627
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:28,071
inappropriate sex in
inappropriate places.

628
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:29,789
You all need a good shrink.

629
00:38:38,266 --> 00:38:41,584
- Dr. Grey?
- Hi.

630
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:44,270
Hey.

631
00:38:44,372 --> 00:38:48,674
I had a goldfish and when he
died we flushed him down the toilet.

632
00:38:48,777 --> 00:38:50,576
Back to the sea.

633
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,062
OK.

634
00:38:58,686 --> 00:39:02,689
Back to the sea is
better than your cubby.

635
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:13,716
You OK?

636
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:18,354
