00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:05,854
Alex, tell me you
don't live with Meredith.

3
00:00:05,956 --> 00:00:09,441
The more available he
gets, the more I pull away.

4
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:13,394
I'm used to being number
one. I'll help. We'll be like a team.

5
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:17,149
Dr. Hahn has agreed to become our
new head of cardiothoracic surgery.

6
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:20,252
- Looking forward to it,
Dr. Yang.
- Ah! Good morning.

7
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,604
Trout for breakfast. Again.

8
00:00:22,706 --> 00:00:27,475
Tonight we will
have hot, perfect sex.

9
00:00:27,577 --> 00:00:31,880
- I'm exhausted.
- Maybe tonight's not the perfect night.

10
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:42,191
<i>♪ Oh, my darlin' ♪</i>

11
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:44,960
<i>Before we were doctors
we were med students,</i>

12
00:00:45,062 --> 00:00:48,580
<i>which meant we spent a
lot of time studying chemistry.</i>

13
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:50,798
- Wow.
- Yeah.

14
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,834
<i>♪ They'll call you left ♪</i>

15
00:00:52,936 --> 00:00:55,804
- That was...
- Aerobic.

16
00:00:55,906 --> 00:00:59,424
- Aerobic bad?
- No. No.

17
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:00,909
Why? Did you think it was bad?

18
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:02,511
- No.
- OK.

19
00:01:02,613 --> 00:01:05,781
No. I mean, obviously,
we both were nervous.

20
00:01:05,882 --> 00:01:10,251
We've been... we've been
waiting for so long, it was like...

21
00:01:10,354 --> 00:01:13,455
- It better be good.
- Better be worth it.

22
00:01:13,557 --> 00:01:18,460
- It's a lot of pressure.
- Yeah.

23
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:22,997
- Let's just do it again.
- Let's get back on that horse.

24
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:25,701
<i>Organic chemistry. Biochemistry.</i>

25
00:01:25,803 --> 00:01:27,736
<i>We learned it all.</i>

26
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:32,691
- What's new with you?
- Saw my half sister half naked.

27
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:36,762
- What's new with you?
- I had dinner and a movie.

28
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:39,698
- With the Chief.
- Mmm.

29
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:44,019
Hey. You could stay.

30
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:46,283
Yeah, I think I'm going to go.

31
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:48,974
Leave you wanting
more and all that.

32
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:51,926
<i>But when you're talking
about human chemistry,</i>

33
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,561
<i>only one thing matters.</i>

34
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:00,918
<i>Either you've
got it or you don't.</i>

35
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,825
Dry cleaning.

36
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:10,028
Yeah. You want some coffee?

37
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,266
Tell them there is a stain on
the left sleeve of the blue one.

38
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:17,569
I'm thinking <i>Godfather</i> tonight.

39
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,070
Sounds good.

40
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:22,407
"I'm gonna make 'em
an offer they can't refuse."

41
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:26,411
- It's Brando.
- Yeah. I got that.

42
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,430
Stella!

43
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:36,354
Hey. I'm taking Meredith
Grey from you this week.

44
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,734
Her mother was a good surgeon,

45
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,703
and I want to see
what she's like.

46
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:41,527
Well, that's not
how it works here.

47
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:44,145
You get assigned a
resident. There's a schedule.

48
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:47,916
Well, the schedule doesn't
take into account certain things.

49
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:51,086
- Like what?
- Like the fact
that I don't want Yang.

50
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:55,690
You can have Stevens. She's good
and I'm sure Shepherd won't mind.

51
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,994
Won't mind what?

52
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,895
She's sassy.

53
00:03:00,998 --> 00:03:04,032
She's a woman of substance,
you two have nothing in common.

54
00:03:04,134 --> 00:03:07,035
I'm late. I had to drop off
the Chief's dry cleaning.

55
00:03:07,137 --> 00:03:09,771
- You're doing his laundry?
- We're helping each other out.

56
00:03:09,873 --> 00:03:14,742
- Yeah? What's he doing?
- He has an extensive DVD
collection.

57
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,195
You're dating the Chief.

58
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,501
I don't care if you
sleep with Lexie.

59
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,603
- Just can't do it at my house.
- It's my house.

60
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,473
Look, get over it. It was
a one time thing anyway.

61
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,442
- Alex.
- Come on, seriously. One time.

62
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,178
What's the problem
with you and your sister?

63
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,247
She's not my sister.

64
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,294
Hey.

65
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,818
- You look weird.
- I don't look weird.

66
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,665
- What's wrong?
- I look fine.

67
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,439
I know you.

68
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,457
It's horrible.

69
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,060
The sex. With Izzie.

70
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:54,899
Horrible. It's like
she's trying too hard.

71
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,386
You ever see a porno? Not that
Izzie's a porno. She's an angel.

72
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,439
But it's like she's trying
to channel a porn star.

73
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:05,377
She's trying to act dirty and
sexy which sounds great, right?

74
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,930
But, in reality, I just
want to say, "Izzie,

75
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:10,910
just 'cause you can
do that with your legs

76
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:13,518
- doesn't mean you should."
- Ah!

77
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:20,442
- I want to run.
- Run. Run. Run now.

78
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,464
Oh!

79
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,077
- I love George.
- Oh, God.

80
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:31,002
I do. I love him. And I'm
so happy because he's kind

81
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:34,255
and smart and sweet and sexy.

82
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:38,193
He's perfect. Except for the
fact he kisses like a chicken.

83
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:41,763
A chicken pecking the ground
for food, just pecking and pecking.

84
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:45,116
And when he's pecking at me
like that I forget that I love him.

85
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,862
I forget he's kind,
sweet and sexy.

86
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,998
I wanna scream,
"Stop pecking me!"

87
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:52,023
Did he peck you
like a chicken, Mer?

88
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,459
- Morning!
- Cristina needs me.

89
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,322
I am painting Burke's apartment,

90
00:04:56,346 --> 00:04:58,830
so I can stop calling
it Burke's apartment.

91
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:01,382
A happy color. Red, like blood.

92
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:04,085
Plus I am on cardio
this whole week.

93
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:05,620
One of the benefits of living

94
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,039
with the person who
makes the schedule.

95
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:12,627
I'm on post-op again.
Second week in a row.

96
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,413
- Trade with me.
- Oh, yeah. No way.

97
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:18,432
- I was talking to Meredith.
- Why? I'm with Hahn.

98
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:20,952
Dude, wake up and
smell the surgical board.

99
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,106
Three days ago there
was a code in room 2037

100
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,175
and no resident to cover it.

101
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:31,713
The schedule is a mess.
Your mess. Clean it up.

102
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,618
- Chief had on his stern face.
- Yeah. You know, I was...

103
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:40,071
I was happy this
morning. You know why?

104
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,725
Because I have back
to back surgeries today.

105
00:05:43,827 --> 00:05:46,027
You have on your "I
want something" face.

106
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:47,369
Will you cover for me?

107
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,232
Just do the Chief Resident
thing so I can stay happy?

108
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:52,651
- Just today. Please, please?
- You want me to...

109
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:56,337
Be me. But, you
know, better. Be you.

110
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:02,327
How's it going, Jerry?

111
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,562
If by how's it going,
you're asking me

112
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,565
if I've had the pleasure of
taking a crap yet, Dr. Karev,

113
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,300
the answer is it's not going,

114
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,169
nothing's going,
nothing's moving.

115
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:14,138
Five days since your bowel
resection, you should be...

116
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,360
Crapping by now? What's the
problem? You botch the surgery?

117
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,611
Is there crap leaking
out into my body?

118
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:24,132
- The surgery was a success...
- Listen, Dr. Karev.

119
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:27,169
Oh, Mama.

120
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:30,505
I've been divorced twice.
My children won't talk to me.

121
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:33,675
I've battled addictions,
filed for bankruptcy.

122
00:06:33,777 --> 00:06:35,877
My life has basically sucked.

123
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,512
But, through it all,

124
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:40,882
the one thing I had going for
me was, I crap like clockwork.

125
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,718
It's a simple pleasure,
I want it back.

126
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,654
So get your little
prescription pad

127
00:06:45,755 --> 00:06:49,724
and write me a prescription
to make me crap.

128
00:06:52,396 --> 00:06:54,495
Grey and Hahn?

129
00:06:56,232 --> 00:06:59,801
OK, she can't do this. She can't
just not teach me. It's her job.

130
00:06:59,903 --> 00:07:01,636
Torres has to make her teach me.

131
00:07:01,738 --> 00:07:03,349
If the chemistry isn't there...

132
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:05,173
Not chemistry.
She doesn't like me.

133
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:08,960
- She says it's chemistry.
- You know, I'm going to Torres.

134
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:13,632
Dr. Torres wanted
me to tell you...

135
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:16,735
- to find another specialty.
- Why?

136
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:18,269
It's not gonna work with Hahn.

137
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,222
So you need to find
a way to make it work

138
00:07:20,324 --> 00:07:24,509
with another specialty. I
suggest you try the ER.

139
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,210
- What?
- This isn't a request.

140
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:29,264
This is an order. From
your Chief Resident.

141
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,451
The ER can be a candy store.

142
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,853
Got car crashes,
impalements. What do you got?

143
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,475
A sprained ankle and
an infected bunion.

144
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,660
It can also strip you
of your will to live.

145
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:44,429
OK, go, troll, find
me something good.

146
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,465
Dr. Yang.

147
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,583
Has Meredith said
anything about me?

148
00:07:49,685 --> 00:07:51,136
She's been avoiding me for days.

149
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:53,583
What did I say about
talking about your life?

150
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,706
Help! My... My baby.

151
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,043
I was carrying her down stairs
and I fell and she hit her head.

152
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,945
She was crying in
the car, now she's not.

153
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:04,360
I'm too scared to look. Someone
please tell me if my baby's alive.

154
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,250
- OK.
- She can't be dead right?

155
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,364
You don't die falling
down the stairs?

156
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:11,272
Please... let me help. I'll
take the baby. It's fine. OK.

157
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:14,642
Oh, my God.

158
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:17,345
Oh, my God.

159
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,515
She's breathing.

160
00:08:20,617 --> 00:08:23,084
Her fontanel feels
tense. She's lethargic.

161
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,523
Take her to Trauma
Two and page Shepherd.

162
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,888
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

163
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:29,334
- Thank you.
- OK. OK.

164
00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:31,709
Ma'am? You're going to
have to stop hugging me

165
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,291
so I can take care
of your baby. Ma'am?

166
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:37,982
Ma'am? Ma'am?

167
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,888
I'm not getting a
heartbeat. No pulse.

168
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,790
Get me a crash cart!
She's not breathing.

169
00:08:54,518 --> 00:08:56,134
- Sponge.
- Dr. Yang?

170
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,347
Teresa Brotherton,
lost vitals, coded.

171
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,965
I needled a tension pneumo.

172
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:02,640
- She regained vitals.
- So much air in the soft tissue

173
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,292
it's obscuring the ultrasound.

174
00:09:04,394 --> 00:09:08,162
Probably punctured an airway
as well as her lung. Feel that?

175
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:12,467
I was talking to Grey. We've
got it from here, Dr. Yang.

176
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:20,825
Call CT. Tell them
we're on our way.

177
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,105
And you didn't
see him swallow it?

178
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,864
You were making collages
while our son choked to death.

179
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,950
It was one marble. Brian,
tell your dad you're not dead.

180
00:09:29,052 --> 00:09:31,052
Ask your mom
what "collage art" is.

181
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,138
Maybe if you came to
my studio you could see.

182
00:09:33,223 --> 00:09:36,091
Look. I'm too busy working
to pay for that studio...

183
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:38,209
OK, Mom! Dad! Just shut up, OK?

184
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,096
Sorry. They're annoying.

185
00:09:41,198 --> 00:09:43,932
- Brian! That's rude.
- Wonder where he gets that?

186
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:46,567
There's not much we can
do except wait for it to pass.

187
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,103
- So he's fine?
- It was one marble.

188
00:09:49,206 --> 00:09:53,375
He's not choking or
drooling. He'll be fine.

189
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,041
But I still get
something, right?

190
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,496
You said after the
hospital I get what I want.

191
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,031
Absolutely. You were brave.

192
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:03,067
- Yeah. Anything you want.
- OK.

193
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,570
I want you guys
to get a divorce.

194
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:10,091
How about a puppy?

195
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,159
- No, Don.
- A boy should have a puppy.

196
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:14,329
I know we talked
about it, but look...

197
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:18,950
We'll infiltrate with a
mixture of bupivicaine

198
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,536
and lido with epi
along these areas here.

199
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:25,106
Is there a surgery that
can make me look like her?

200
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,153
You're much prettier
than Dr. Stevens.

201
00:10:27,177 --> 00:10:30,278
Then how come I can't
remember the last time I had sex?

202
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,148
Bet Dr. Stevens can remember
the last time she had sex.

203
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,361
Harriet, don't
harass the residents.

204
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,717
She still has her looks.

205
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:39,287
Although, you're already
getting worry lines.

206
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,816
What do you have
to be worried about?

207
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,708
Nothing. I don't
have worry lines.

208
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,988
Your frown line is
already prominent.

209
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:49,080
Whatever is wrong in your
life, you need to fix it quick.

210
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:52,767
'Cause once this stuff starts
south, it's a long way back.

211
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:54,202
Trust me.

212
00:10:54,304 --> 00:10:56,955
- Know what this is?
- Looks like multiple

213
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:59,335
rib fractures and a
massive hemothorax.

214
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:03,394
Actually, it's you giving up OR
Two. My patient is emergent.

215
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,675
What do I tell my patient?

216
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:08,550
If it were me I'd tell
her to age gracefully.

217
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:14,533
Your baby has a
slight brain contusion.

218
00:11:14,557 --> 00:11:16,385
Her brain's bruised. It's minor.

219
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,876
But I'd like to keep her
here for observation.

220
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:22,413
I got to tell you, Dr. Shepherd,
I'm listening to you,

221
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,915
but I'm not hearing
anything you're saying.

222
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,102
Dr. Hahn is taking my
wife into surgery right now

223
00:11:27,204 --> 00:11:29,587
and I need to go be with her.

224
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,855
You know what you're doing.

225
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:34,275
Go ahead and do it. I
need to go be with my wife.

226
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,728
Wait.

227
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,314
What's your daughter's name?

228
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:42,533
She doesn't have one yet.

229
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,503
We just adopted her a week ago.

230
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:48,155
Just been trying
to get to know her.

231
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:53,611
- Clear!
- Charged.

232
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,062
No rhythm.

233
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:57,415
Clear!

234
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:00,685
Push intracardiac epi.

235
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,152
There you go.

236
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,038
Get ready to
cross-clamp the aorta.

237
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:07,574
The heart's responding.
Sinus rhythm.

238
00:12:07,677 --> 00:12:10,644
All right. That's twice in two
hours this woman has died.

239
00:12:10,746 --> 00:12:14,415
Let's pick up the pace. The less
time she's on the table, the better.

240
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:17,201
Quite a rush, huh?

241
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:24,658
Hahn took my OR. She's pushy.

242
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:29,480
Pushy and rude.

243
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,733
Is she doing a
stapled tractotomy?

244
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:34,885
She's trying to save as
much lung tissue as possible.

245
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,990
Doesn't make up
for pushy and rude.

246
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:44,361
No. It doesn't.

247
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,703
You paged me?

248
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:56,474
Yeah. I was wondering, do
you think I can pick her up?

249
00:12:56,576 --> 00:13:00,044
The baby? I mean, the father
hasn't really been down here

250
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,379
and she's been
through so much already.

251
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:05,049
That's not why you paged me.

252
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,017
- It's not?
- No.

253
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,954
You paged 'cause your legs
are shaking from the other night.

254
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:14,175
Trying to work up the nerve to
invite me to a friendly on call room.

255
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:20,448
I paged you because I wanted
to know if you could tell Meredith

256
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,301
that I had no idea that
her house was your house.

257
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,486
I mean, she and I, we
were making progress.

258
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:28,773
And now she must
think that I'm a stalker.

259
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,009
Sorry. Your issues
can't be my issues.

260
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,795
But I am here for
the sex if you need it.

261
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,614
If I need it?

262
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:38,582
You know you need it.

263
00:13:43,873 --> 00:13:45,707
Have you seen Dr. Torres?

264
00:13:45,808 --> 00:13:50,962
She promised a breakdown for next week's
ENT conference by the end of the day.

265
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,313
She asked me to pass it along.

266
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,766
Must have slipped
my mind. My apologies.

267
00:13:55,869 --> 00:14:00,020
Oh, good. I mean, this
is good. This... Nice work.

268
00:14:00,122 --> 00:14:02,039
Thank you. I mean, yeah.

269
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:11,616
Ooh!

270
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,851
Sorry. I'm sorry.

271
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,420
No, it's fine. It's
just... It's just...

272
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,803
Ow! Ow!

273
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:20,074
- Sorry.
- You go that way. I go...

274
00:14:20,176 --> 00:14:22,526
You know, we... We should...

275
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,263
We should stop for a second.

276
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,132
We should just... We're a
little nervous and awkward.

277
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,752
We just have to admit we're
nervous and we're awkward.

278
00:14:30,854 --> 00:14:32,565
Yeah. A little awkward.

279
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:34,672
Yeah. Because we're nervous.

280
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,891
We just need to
get over ourselves.

281
00:14:36,993 --> 00:14:39,277
- How?
- Um...

282
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,917
We pick a fantasy.

283
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:49,803
- What?
- You know, a fantasy.

284
00:14:49,905 --> 00:14:52,440
We could pick a fantasy. Any...

285
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,158
Fantasy.

286
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,710
Any...

287
00:14:55,812 --> 00:15:00,047
I will do anything
that you want me to.

288
00:15:01,384 --> 00:15:03,033
Anything?

289
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:10,441
- That's what you wanted?
- No.

290
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:13,711
I mean... Yes.

291
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,381
But that's not what I meant.

292
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,484
- What did you mean then?
- Nothing.

293
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:23,121
Let's just not ever talk
about this again. Please.

294
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,708
We have chemistry,
George. I know we have it

295
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,026
because we had the best
sex I ever had in my life.

296
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,461
Do you remember that sex?

297
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:34,732
I do. It's vague and
it's in flashes, but I do.

298
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:38,352
I want that sex
back. We can do this.

299
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:40,070
Well, I want that sex back.

300
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,124
I think I chipped my tooth.

301
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,281
I've been trying to do what
you said, but it's not working.

302
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:53,134
- What... What did I say?
- To try another specialty.

303
00:15:53,236 --> 00:15:55,269
Cristina, I have back
to back surgeries,

304
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,855
and I don't know what
you're talking about so...

305
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,157
Dr. Bailey said it was your
idea, but I thought maybe

306
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:04,362
- I could have some input...
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. That. The...

307
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:09,050
Yeah, my idea to... For
you to try other specialties.

308
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,402
So can I... Can I
scrub in with you?

309
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:13,768
You hate ortho.

310
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:16,490
No, I love ortho. But I
can't observe anymore.

311
00:16:16,593 --> 00:16:18,976
I need to scrub in.
And even if it's on ortho.

312
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,796
Which I love.

313
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,633
OK.

314
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,902
No, I don't love ortho.

315
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,707
- Morning.
- Morning.

316
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:39,380
I'm a person of substance.
Plastics isn't all facelifts.

317
00:16:39,482 --> 00:16:42,116
I do many substantial,
life-changing surgeries.

318
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:45,453
Hmm.

319
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:49,740
- Hey.
- Um, the stain's still there.

320
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,410
So next time stand there, make sure
you watch them mark it with the tape.

321
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,731
Hmm...

322
00:16:56,832 --> 00:17:00,434
And everyone thinks it's so
easy being the Chief's girlfriend.

323
00:17:00,536 --> 00:17:03,203
- Need to talk, I'm here.
- Yeah.

324
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:13,164
Oh. Hi. Uh...

325
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:15,733
I just came by to
update him on the baby.

326
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:18,202
But I can... come back.

327
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:23,374
Listen, I had... I had no
idea it was your house.

328
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:27,345
I... and, you know, I'm not the
girl who sleeps around. I'm not.

329
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,214
It's just, you know, so
much going on at home that...

330
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:31,783
How is she doing?

331
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:37,571
Well, she made it through the
night. That's a very good sign.

332
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:43,744
Oh, yeah? Yeah, well,
she's strong. She'll make it.

333
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,599
She's not going to let that baby
grow up without a mother, huh?

334
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:55,273
Hey. You're OK.

335
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,926
Oh, no. Don't try to talk, OK?

336
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,634
Your baby's fine.
She's feeding well.

337
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:10,871
She's doing great. I
can get her if you'd like.

338
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:15,375
Dr. Grey, why don't
you go get the baby?

339
00:18:15,477 --> 00:18:18,345
You're Dr. Grey too?
Are you two sisters?

340
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,752
No. Just same last name.

341
00:18:35,064 --> 00:18:37,565
I was just thinking about
this crap I took in the Army.

342
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:40,500
Still nothing? I gave you
a pretty good laxative.

343
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:43,404
Not strong enough, apparently.
Have a seat, Dr. Karev.

344
00:18:43,506 --> 00:18:46,491
If I can't crap, you're going
to sit here while I reminisce.

345
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,613
Morning, Harriet. Let's get you
out of bed and get you mobile.

346
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,466
I'm in too much
pain. Leave me alone.

347
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:58,001
Yep, the best thing for
pain is to get you out of bed.

348
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:01,005
- You'll feel much better.
- I'll feel better if you leave.

349
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:03,173
- Harriet.
- Stop scowling.

350
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,536
You can scowl later,

351
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,077
when you actually have
something to scowl about,

352
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,580
when your ass expands
and you get a double chin.

353
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:12,400
But right now you are young.
You should be having fun.

354
00:19:12,502 --> 00:19:14,662
Go! Start enjoying your life.

355
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,504
You're getting
uglier by the minute!

356
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,642
- Hang another bag.
- Stop the...

357
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,024
Her heart stopped again.

358
00:19:23,112 --> 00:19:26,113
They got it started... Look. I
can't deal with her right now.

359
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,833
- Could you take her back?
- Continue CPR.

360
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,334
No rhythm.

361
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:33,420
Now! Could you
take her away, now!

362
00:19:33,522 --> 00:19:36,790
- Let's go with epi.
- All set.

363
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,879
Uh, Dr. Torres, could
I talk to you a minute?

364
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,632
I'm in the middle of
a shattered femur.

365
00:19:44,734 --> 00:19:48,719
Thank God for men who
ride motorcycles, right?

366
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,120
Right.

367
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:53,457
There's some scheduling
issues you have to deal with.

368
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,444
Yeah, can you handle
that again? Thanks.

369
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,378
I need to talk to Dr. Torres.

370
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:04,785
My patient won't crap,
won't stop talking about it.

371
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:06,820
- I'm done.
- Dr. Torres in there?

372
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:09,442
My facelift won't walk.
I can't work with her.

373
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:10,874
Shepherd's ready to discharge

374
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,777
Teresa Brotherton's baby,
but the father's in no condition.

375
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,663
OK. Is there a problem?

376
00:20:15,765 --> 00:20:18,849
Just a little
administrative traffic jam.

377
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,034
Dr. Torres has it under control.

378
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:26,873
OK, here's what's
going to happen.

379
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:30,210
Take Crap Man and put him in
the same room with Lazy Facelift.

380
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:31,679
They can abuse each other.

381
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:35,015
The baby can stay another
night. Now get out of here.

382
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:38,752
And if anyone asks,
none of this was my idea.

383
00:20:39,922 --> 00:20:42,539
- Excuse us. Where does it hurt?
- Everywhere.

384
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:45,042
- Didn't the marble come out?
- Yeah. Last night.

385
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:47,795
It really hurts. I
ate some more.

386
00:20:47,897 --> 00:20:50,430
You what? You said you
took the rest from his room.

387
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:52,783
- I did!
- Well, obviously, you didn't!

388
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:57,171
- Hey. How many did you eat?
- Eight.

389
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,494
Is this what you ate?

390
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,696
Brian, this isn't a
marble. This is a magnet!

391
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:08,765
Page Dr. Bailey. Tell
her it's an emergency.

392
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:12,886
Magnets take the path of least
resistance to get to each other.

393
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:16,057
And if that means going
through the wall of the intestine,

394
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,342
then that's what they're
going to do. There.

395
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:22,879
I'm looking at a perfed bowel
here. Going to need surgery.

396
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:27,001
Dr. Bailey. There's
another one. It's moving.

397
00:21:27,103 --> 00:21:29,737
Like a slow-motion gunshot.

398
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:33,924
Gotta stop it before it rips
through his stomach and kills him.

399
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,326
Come on.

400
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,634
- Here we go, Jerry.
- What the hell is this?

401
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:46,170
Oh, room shortage. You're
going to have to double up.

402
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:48,622
- What?
- Yeah. Harriet, meet Jerry.

403
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,908
- This is absurd!
- Not so angry, Jerry.

404
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,260
Not good for the
complexion. Right, Harriet?

405
00:21:53,362 --> 00:21:56,329
Harriet, Jerry may monopolize
the bathroom for a few hours,

406
00:21:56,432 --> 00:21:58,077
so if you need
to go, I'd go now.

407
00:21:58,101 --> 00:22:00,917
- This is unacceptable.
- I don't even think it's legal.

408
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,304
My advice would be to
get yourselves discharged

409
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,906
- as quickly as possible.
- See you.

410
00:22:10,846 --> 00:22:13,096
I have seven magnets in my tray.

411
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:15,766
He said he swallowed eight.

412
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:18,051
There's a hole in his diaphragm.

413
00:22:18,153 --> 00:22:20,320
One could have
wandered up to his chest.

414
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,572
- Forceps.
- Gonna repair the diaphragm?

415
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,509
First I want to see if
the magnet will find me.

416
00:22:28,297 --> 00:22:30,781
He did this so his parents
would get a divorce.

417
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,216
They fight all the time,

418
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:34,869
he made himself sick so
they'd take him seriously.

419
00:22:34,971 --> 00:22:37,254
- I bet they
take him seriously now.
- No.

420
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,701
They said they'd try
not to fight so much.

421
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,992
I'm elbow deep in
their eight-year-old.

422
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:46,347
Sounds like something a
little extra effort can't fix.

423
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:48,415
You're probably right.

424
00:22:48,517 --> 00:22:52,386
I am so right about
so many things,

425
00:22:52,488 --> 00:22:54,838
it would make your head spin.

426
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:59,209
Her hands are beautiful.

427
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:03,163
I mean, surgically, the finesse.

428
00:23:03,265 --> 00:23:06,584
I was in ortho all day. There's
no finesse to breaking bones.

429
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:09,036
- Carpentry.
- Carpentry.

430
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,338
Yeah. You want finesse
you should try plastics.

431
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,659
- It's all finesse.
- Yeah. No room for error

432
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:18,979
when you're dealing
with someone's face.

433
00:23:19,081 --> 00:23:22,700
It's more than just facelifts.
I'm a board-certified ENT.

434
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:24,935
I take out tumors.

435
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:29,272
It's also a lot of facelifts.

436
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:32,743
But even a facelift...
I'm changing a life.

437
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:37,114
I'm holding someone's
future in my hands.

438
00:23:42,438 --> 00:23:45,355
Holding a heart is way better.

439
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:01,155
She's good. Yeah.

440
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:04,959
She's sleeping, but we
can go in if you want to...

441
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:13,334
Dr. Hahn said that Teresa's...

442
00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:16,270
Well, she's not in good shape.

443
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:19,006
Her other lung is leaking now.

444
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:24,461
They can't operate 'cause her
heart is too weak from all the strain.

445
00:24:25,948 --> 00:24:29,083
So they're gonna see if she's
gonna make it through the night

446
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:30,868
and reassess in the morning.

447
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,706
- I am so sorry.
- Yeah.

448
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:40,444
I need to know who to call just
in case my wife doesn't make it.

449
00:24:40,546 --> 00:24:43,013
I can't do this on my own.

450
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:46,266
I know what I'm capable of,

451
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:49,069
and I can't raise a
kid without my wife.

452
00:24:49,972 --> 00:24:52,472
A kid that's not
even my own blood.

453
00:24:54,209 --> 00:24:56,176
The kid deserves a family.

454
00:24:56,278 --> 00:24:58,011
And, hey, I'm not a bad guy,

455
00:24:58,113 --> 00:25:01,281
and I see her and
she's good, you know.

456
00:25:01,383 --> 00:25:04,284
She's a good
baby. But I'm not...

457
00:25:04,386 --> 00:25:07,971
You're her father.
She needs you.

458
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:12,442
She needs you now
more... You're her father.

459
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:14,528
I don't feel like her father.

460
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,098
I look at her and I just...

461
00:25:20,469 --> 00:25:23,987
I see that she's not
mine, she's just a baby.

462
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,469
What did you do tonight?

463
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:42,522
I stayed late at work
because my house is a brothel.

464
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,392
What did you do?

465
00:25:45,494 --> 00:25:47,861
- Oh, no!
- What?

466
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:48,963
Dinner and a movie.

467
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:50,893
- Dinner and a movie?
- Oh!

468
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:55,652
Dinner... Oh, dear. I...
I'm sorry. I'll just... OK.

469
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:58,538
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. OK.

470
00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:02,408
It's a box of fun. You know?

471
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:06,546
It's just been too much.

472
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,281
- Too much pressure.
- Yeah.

473
00:26:08,384 --> 00:26:11,702
Too much trying. We just
got to get back to having fun.

474
00:26:12,888 --> 00:26:15,405
- Yeah. So it's a box of props?
- It's a box of fun.

475
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,774
OK.

476
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:19,476
- Can I...?
- Mmm-hmm.

477
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,045
Yeah.

478
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:25,182
A box of fun and booze,
because I figure it can't hurt.

479
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:27,918
Yeah. Yeah. Oh! That's...

480
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,305
No. You know what?
Don't say it. This will work.

481
00:26:31,407 --> 00:26:32,990
- Yeah.
- We will work.

482
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,142
- Need to take the pressure off.
- Yeah.

483
00:26:35,244 --> 00:26:37,577
- We have the house
to ourselves.
- Good.

484
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,647
We're going to have a
drink. And we're going to play.

485
00:26:42,617 --> 00:26:44,951
- We'll play.
- Play.

486
00:26:45,054 --> 00:26:47,320
With our box of fun.

487
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:51,824
That's...

488
00:26:56,498 --> 00:27:00,350
- Definitely don't wanna go in.
- Alex. George and Izzie?

489
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,751
Yeah.

490
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:07,041
The Chief just saw me naked.

491
00:27:07,143 --> 00:27:11,428
Huh, nice.

492
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,097
I thought I said no having
sex with her at this house.

493
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,249
I didn't invite her over.

494
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,621
- Hi.
- Hey.

495
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,224
Um, Alex, do you want
to get a drink at Joe's?

496
00:27:24,326 --> 00:27:27,111
Yeah. Sure.

497
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:28,812
Alex.

498
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,784
There's no rule that says
he can't have a drink with me.

499
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:36,937
Actually, there is. I'm making
one. No drinking with Alex.

500
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,472
No sleeping with Alex.

501
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:41,659
- What did I ever do to you?
- Get your own friends.

502
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:44,361
Get your own life.
Stop living in mine!

503
00:27:45,681 --> 00:27:49,533
Screw you. I'll wait at the car.

504
00:27:53,622 --> 00:27:55,739
I know that was mean,
but she's everywhere.

505
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:59,209
You say she's not your sister.
Say you don't wanna know her.

506
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:01,038
So why the hell do
you care so much?

507
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:07,283
I don't. I don't.

508
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:09,469
I don't care.

509
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,498
- Morning.
- Hey. Got to get to work.

510
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,684
Yeah, yeah. Me too.
Got to go. Got to go.

511
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:33,960
All I'm saying is, the next time
you have company, lock the door.

512
00:28:34,062 --> 00:28:38,231
All I'm saying is, the next time
you come over you should knock.

513
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,528
Where is she?

514
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,897
Well, it looks like she
finally got out of bed.

515
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:59,619
Oh!

516
00:28:59,721 --> 00:29:01,266
Oh, my God!

517
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,890
We're adults, don't
look so shocked!

518
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,870
She always looks like that.

519
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:12,348
I guess he finally crapped.

520
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:15,619
- What?
- Even they have chemistry.

521
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:22,009
Dr. O'Malley. Brian, he's
really going to be OK, right?

522
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:24,961
Kids bounce back more
quickly than adults so...

523
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:28,865
We used to be really happy.

524
00:29:28,968 --> 00:29:32,418
- I'm sorry?
- My husband and I. We really were.

525
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,087
Before.

526
00:29:35,457 --> 00:29:39,893
Brian was a colicky baby and
Don lost his job and my mother died

527
00:29:39,995 --> 00:29:42,545
- and all this baggage piled up.
- I'm... I don't...

528
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:45,248
I just keep thinking that
we have to get back there.

529
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:48,279
Maybe Brian's right.

530
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:50,854
Maybe Don and I do need
a break from each other.

531
00:29:50,939 --> 00:29:54,457
We haven't been
happy in a long time.

532
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,200
Pressure's stable.

533
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,553
She put her on a heart and
lung machine in her room?

534
00:30:07,655 --> 00:30:10,457
She wasn't gonna survive
another day without surgery,

535
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,376
too unstable to
transport to the OR,

536
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:16,413
so Hahn had to bring the OR
to her. It's pretty genius, right?

537
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,215
It's genius.

538
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:22,669
Dr. Grey. Make sure
her lines are clear.

539
00:30:22,771 --> 00:30:25,789
The last thing we need is a
kink to send her into arrest.

540
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:29,693
Anybody gets so much as a
bad feeling, we stop and reassess.

541
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:31,261
She's going to make it, right?

542
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:34,264
He said he's gonna give the
baby up if she doesn't make it.

543
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:35,165
She has to make it.

544
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:36,761
Kind of busy right now, Lex.

545
00:30:36,785 --> 00:30:39,546
- Road trip.
- - Get that out of the way.

546
00:30:42,224 --> 00:30:43,367
Hey.

547
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:45,758
Mr. Brotherton,
we need to go now.

548
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:49,612
I will send Dr. Grey out to
you with periodic updates.

549
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:54,868
I promise I'm going to do
everything in my power to fix your wife.

550
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,127
- I got a thing for her.
- You don't.

551
00:31:20,229 --> 00:31:22,079
I do. I do. I have
a thing for her.

552
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:23,062
It's going to end badly.

553
00:31:23,164 --> 00:31:24,709
- You don't know.
- Yes, I do.

554
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:26,749
What do you know?
You're dating the Chief.

555
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:29,670
That joke's not funny
anymore. It's overused.

556
00:31:38,346 --> 00:31:40,186
- Lover's quarrel?
- Oh, Jesus.

557
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,032
We're not quarreling.
Not a quarrel.

558
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:44,228
More importantly, we're not...

559
00:31:44,252 --> 00:31:47,887
If I go through the
trouble to choose a movie,

560
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,022
he should have enough
common courtesy

561
00:31:50,124 --> 00:31:52,109
to mention it if he
makes other plans.

562
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:53,977
A phone call, a note, something.

563
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,479
And if he's not going to
pick up my shirts, just tell me.

564
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,914
I'll pick them up.

565
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:00,516
I'm perfectly capable of
picking up my own shirts.

566
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:01,863
No, you're not.

567
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:04,047
You're not capable of
picking up your shirts.

568
00:32:04,072 --> 00:32:06,184
You're not capable of
anything on your own.

569
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:08,691
If I wasn't around, you'd
starve in a dirty shirt,

570
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:11,361
- die a lonely death.
- Oh, for God's sake.

571
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:13,108
I offered a place
to put your trailer,

572
00:32:13,132 --> 00:32:15,376
and you've taken
advantage ever since.

573
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,317
You can't handle picking up
the dry cleaning or cooking,

574
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,740
so I have to pick
up all the slack.

575
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:24,323
Hold that thought.

576
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:28,127
You see? He can't
handle the truth.

577
00:32:28,964 --> 00:32:31,665
I definitely have
a thing for her.

578
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:35,001
- <i>Dr. Holden, 2292.</i>
- Miranda.

579
00:32:35,103 --> 00:32:38,454
Do you have any idea why the
Brothertons' baby's still here?

580
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:42,075
Dr. Torres decided to keep
the baby here for another day.

581
00:32:42,177 --> 00:32:45,879
Why, if Dr. Shepherd was
ready to discharge her?

582
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:48,231
I don't know. You
have to ask Dr. Torres.

583
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:49,544
Mmm-hmm.

584
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:51,501
If it was me and the
mother kept coding,

585
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:53,236
I might keep the baby around

586
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:55,338
so they could get a
little more time together.

587
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,720
Mmm-hmm.

588
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,177
And why did Torres
have Stevens and Karev

589
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,474
put their patients
in the same room?

590
00:33:03,498 --> 00:33:05,732
That's a clear
violation of protocol.

591
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:08,285
You have to ask her.

592
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:11,271
But those two patients
were impossible,

593
00:33:11,373 --> 00:33:15,726
and neither one was willing
to follow post-op instruction...

594
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:18,762
I mean, if it was me, I would
put them both in the same room

595
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:21,581
so they could encourage
each other to get out of here.

596
00:33:21,683 --> 00:33:26,069
And she told Dr. Yang
to find a new specialty?

597
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,905
That's a pretty odd
thing to say to someone

598
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,940
who has such an
affinity for cardio.

599
00:33:31,025 --> 00:33:33,777
Again, you'll have
to ask Torres,

600
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:36,224
but it has to do with the fact

601
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:38,999
that Erica Hahn's putting
her through her paces,

602
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:41,479
so Yang needs to see
what else is out there,

603
00:33:41,503 --> 00:33:44,554
otherwise she's won't fight
hard enough to stay with cardio.

604
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:48,825
I'm just guessing. OK,
you need to ask Torres.

605
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:51,377
That's just what
I'm going to do.

606
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:06,259
OK, it's been an hour. We
should've heard something.

607
00:34:06,361 --> 00:34:09,562
Well, the fact that we
haven't heard anything is good.

608
00:34:09,664 --> 00:34:11,614
That means that
they've got her in the OR

609
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,234
and they've opened her up.

610
00:34:14,336 --> 00:34:16,936
Yeah, every step of this
that she survives is good.

611
00:34:20,108 --> 00:34:21,924
Oh, God.

612
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:27,047
So we were able to find one
puncture in her remaining lung.

613
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:30,516
We're preparing to
place a patch over it.

614
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:34,304
Hopefully that's the only
leak and the patch will hold.

615
00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:41,728
I should be getting back.

616
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:52,689
You know, you said your wife
bonded instantly with the baby.

617
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,776
For some people it's
like that. For other people,

618
00:34:56,878 --> 00:34:58,844
they need a little
more time with the baby

619
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:01,159
before they can
feel like a family.

620
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:03,717
I bet you know her better
than you think you do.

621
00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:08,070
All I know is that
she cries. OK?

622
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:10,590
And she eats. A lot.

623
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:13,310
You know, we were going
through formula like crazy.

624
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:17,914
And she sleeps with
her hand above her chin.

625
00:35:18,517 --> 00:35:21,284
And she likes my wife.

626
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:23,803
Teresa soothes her, you know?

627
00:35:23,905 --> 00:35:26,439
She puts her hand
on her back and...

628
00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:31,911
she let's her suck on her
finger. But that's all I know.

629
00:35:32,013 --> 00:35:37,233
That's five things no one
else knows. That's five things.

630
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:50,930
Patch is secure. Water please.

631
00:35:54,603 --> 00:35:57,654
All right, let's see if I
earned my paycheck today.

632
00:35:57,756 --> 00:36:00,040

00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:52,885
Because I was wondering
if you would meet me later.

669
00:37:52,987 --> 00:37:55,055
In the on call room.

670
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:57,540
I can't.

671
00:37:57,643 --> 00:38:00,143
Oh. I thought you said that...

672
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:03,145
Yeah, I know what
I said. But I can't.

673
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,215
Because of Meredith.

674
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:10,453
I'm not getting involved in
whatever you two got going on.

675
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:12,288
I'm not choosing sides.

676
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:16,142

<i>Dr. George to OR One.
Dr. George to OR One.</i>

678
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,972
Dr. Bailey.

679
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:31,507
You've been
covering for Dr. Torres.

680
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:36,012
Chief, I've just been
shuffling a little paperwork for...

681
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:39,983
You've been doing the lion's
share of the Chief Resident's work.

682
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:44,721
All the responsibility
and none of the credit.

683
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:48,608
You deserve the credit.
You deserve the job.

684
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,961
I should have given it
to you in the first place.

685
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,313
I hope you'll take it now.

686
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:58,868
Because what you
do and how you do it...

687
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,770
makes this hospital work.

688
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:07,960
Well, it's about
time you noticed.

689
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,283

690
00:40:02,517 --> 00:40:04,083

691
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:07,670
Yeah, of course. Nurse.

692
00:40:14,528 --> 00:40:16,112
- OK.
- Thank you.

693
00:40:24,072 --> 00:40:25,822
It's OK.

694
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:31,377
I remember a sixth thing.

695
00:40:33,815 --> 00:40:37,183
She hates the car seat.

696
00:40:37,285 --> 00:40:41,453
Unless you put this little duck
up under her head, you know.

697
00:40:41,556 --> 00:40:43,556
Hey.

698
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:48,694
I'm going to name
you Keisha, OK?

699
00:40:48,796 --> 00:40:52,031
Because that's what your
mommy wanted to name you.

700
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:13,269
I'm not stalking. I just...

701
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:17,356
I hate apples. Hate them.

702
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:20,026
Think they shouldn't
be allowed to be a fruit.

703
00:41:20,127 --> 00:41:23,012
That's one. And two...

704
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:25,798

well on an Etch A Sketch.

705

706
00:41:27,101 --> 00:41:28,651
Like, I could be
a professional if,

707
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:31,670
you know, that
profession existed.

708
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:35,524
I play the trombone. Badly.

709
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:37,744
I like math.

710
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:39,995

this thing with your hands

711
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:41,664

to make a point.

712

713
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:47,837
And I know that's
about you, but I do it too,

714
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:53,243
so it's also about
me and so that's five.

715
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:56,812
Five things that I'm
hoping will make it a little bit

716
00:41:56,915 --> 00:41:58,331
harder for you to hate me.

717
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:19,202
I told her I could draw
with an Etch A Sketch.

718
00:42:19,304 --> 00:42:21,404
Of all the things I
could've chosen...

719
00:42:21,506 --> 00:42:24,807
No wonder she
thinks I'm pathetic.

720
00:42:29,564 --> 00:42:32,482

- I know.

721
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:35,868

- I know.
