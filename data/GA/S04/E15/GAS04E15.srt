1
00:00:02,403 --> 00:00:03,996
<i>The problem with
being a resident is</i>

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,654
<i>you feel crazy all the time.</i>

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,559
<i>You haven't slept in years.</i>

4
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:23,238
<i>You spend every day around
people in massive crisis.</i>

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,391
<i>You lose your ability
to judge what's normal...</i>

6
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:29,028
Move your crap off the
floor before this eats it.

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,463
OK, OK, OK.

8
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:36,484
<i>In yourself or anyone else.</i>

9
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:40,322
<i>And yet people are constantly asking
you to tell them how they're doing.</i>

10
00:00:40,424 --> 00:00:42,384
<i>How the hell are you
supposed to know?</i>

11
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,493
- Eggs good?
- Uh-huh.

12
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:49,231
- The baby didn't
like the breakfast.
- All right, into the can.

13
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,766
<i>You don't even know
how you're doing.</i>

14
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,954
We had our first honest
conversation about your feelings

15
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,474
and now you want to leave.
That doesn't strike you as strange?

16
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:01,409
No. And I'm still firing you.

17
00:01:01,512 --> 00:01:03,728
- No, you're quitting.
- I'm not quitting.

18
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,515
- I don't quit things.
- Well, actually you do.

19
00:01:06,617 --> 00:01:09,251
Your mother quit your
father, your father quit you,

20
00:01:09,353 --> 00:01:12,587
you quit your boyfriend, and
if I read your chart correctly,

21
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,191
you quit your life, momentarily,
on a couple of occasions. You quit.

22
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:19,427
- It's what you know how to do.
- Now, you're really fired.

23
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:23,648
Now, we're getting somewhere.

24
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,319
I want you to handle my consults.
Anything you can do without me, do it.

25
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,155
Book time in the robotics lab, I
want to give him a tour. Hahn.

26
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,875
Walter Tapley's coming in. Do we
have anything he can scrub in on?

27
00:01:33,977 --> 00:01:37,145
- Walter Tapley is coming here?
- - The chief was his student.

28
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:40,465
You studied at the
right hand of God?

29
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,317
- Wow.
- We need something impressive.

30
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,486
I will stab someone
in the chest if I have to.

31
00:01:44,588 --> 00:01:47,856
O'Malley, get
Boyer ready for a CT

32
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,424
and prep my lap chole.

33
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,526
I need to be out of that OR by
ten. Hahn! Plan to be free at ten.

34
00:01:52,562 --> 00:01:54,946
O'Malley, did Patricia
say I had any messages?

35
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,382
Yeah. She said...

36
00:01:57,485 --> 00:02:00,535
She said to tell you your wife
hadn't called in the 20 minutes

37
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:02,648
since you last asked
if your wife called.

38
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:03,921
All right.

39
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:09,577
- Hey.
- I'm very optimistic about
this new viral cocktail.

40
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,597
Adding an IL-2 should make
a big difference. We're close.

41
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,650
- We're going to open
champagne soon.
- I know.

42
00:02:16,753 --> 00:02:19,220
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

43
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,580
Listen, clinical
trials can be a grind.

44
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:24,092
If this is getting to you,
I can do this on my own.

45
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:27,395
I'm not a quitter. I don't need
you to rescue me. Let's just do this.

46
00:02:27,497 --> 00:02:30,566
Waiting is a bad idea. We're
talking about your health.

47
00:02:30,668 --> 00:02:32,801
Dr. Shepherd can
say no if it's a problem.

48
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,368
What am I saying no to?

49
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:37,906
Is there any way to push
back the surgery a few hours?

50
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:40,942
My boyfriend's flight was
canceled. I want him to be here.

51
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:43,195
- Greta.
- He has some questions.

52
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,781
He's so smart about this.
I don't know what to ask.

53
00:02:45,883 --> 00:02:48,061
Are you reconsidering
the procedure?

54
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:51,436
Andre and I have had so little
time together. We met in January.

55
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:55,289
I mean, this treatment
could kill me, right?

56
00:02:57,093 --> 00:03:00,653
An aggressive tumor. Don't
operate, you're looking at months.

57
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:03,415
But I'd spend them with Andre.

58
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,868
Do you know how precious that
is? Time with the person you love?

59
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,921
- Greta.
- I'm not saying I want to cancel.

60
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:14,142
I'm just saying I want to wait
for Andre. He'll help me to decide.

61
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:17,445
- OK, we can't wait for...
- He'll be here at three.

62
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,272
Dr. Mark Sloan. I used
to be a patient of his.

63
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:29,841
Rebecca?

64
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,743
- Where have you been?
- Hi, Izzie.

65
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:34,812
I've called you and
left, like, 50 messages.

66
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:38,683
- You seem kind of upset.
- You're not pregnant,
first of all,

67
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:42,221
and Alex has been turning his life
upside down to be your baby-daddy,

68
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:45,890
and I can't tell him because of
confidentiality. So, yeah, upset.

69
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,844
You can talk to Alex about
anything. I want him involved.

70
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:51,112
And I am pregnant.
You kind of know.

71
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:54,299
OK. So if you're not trying to
trap Alex with a fake pregnancy,

72
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,135
you won't mind if I do
another test just to be sure.

73
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,487
Trap him? Are you
out of your mind?

74
00:03:59,589 --> 00:04:01,523
I'm pregnant. And
that's a good thing.

75
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:05,060
Because I want this baby.
I've always wanted a baby.

76
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,295
You have a baby.

77
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:09,614
Of course I do. I mean
I want another one.

78
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,901
Do the stupid test
again, it'll be fine.

79
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:16,070
I need to see Dr. Sloan.
Can you help me with that?

80
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,156
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

81
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:21,176
- Dr. Shepherd?
- Yes?

82
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,629
- There's no Andre.
- What?

83
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,043
She made him up.
He doesn't exist.

84
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:30,418
My sister, she's not a woman
who has boyfriends, OK?

85
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,936
Then four months ago,

86
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:35,073
she goes on a cruise, comes
back saying she met her soul mate.

87
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:36,941
Around the time her
symptoms started?

88
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:41,062
There are no pictures and nobody
has ever seen him. Can you talk to her?

89
00:04:41,164 --> 00:04:43,832
Can you tell her we
can't wait for Andre?

90
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:46,351
Because we could
be waiting a long time.

91
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,780
- Is Tapley in there?
- No.

92
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,269
- You're lying.
- Yes.

93
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,761
- Tapley in there?
- No.

94
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,763
- Liar.
- Yes.

95
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,932
- Something is wrong with her.
- No, I'm fine.

96
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,452
She cleaned. Cleaned the apartment,
which she has no idea how to do.

97
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,904
- She pushed dirt around.
- Leave her alone.

98
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,025
Not everybody has to be happy.
That's not mental health. That's crap.

99
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:13,990
Walter Tapley's here and
she doesn't want to meet him.

100
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,054
- Well, that's bad.
- You know what, Torres?

101
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:19,284
- Mind your own business.
- You need to get help.

102
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,335
You're killing me.

103
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:24,038
Hang out until Hahn gets
here, you might meet Tapley.

104
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:27,258
- I don't give a damn
about Tapley.
- Cristina.

105
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,846
- Are you in the dark place?
- Yeah.

106
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:33,698
Me, too.

107
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,355
There she is. Dr. Erica Hahn,
our chief of cardiothoracic surgery.

108
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:42,623
It's an honor to
meet you, Dr. Tapley.

109
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:45,544
I use your modified bypass
procedure all the time.

110
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:48,180
Yeah, well, that was
an afternoon well spent.

111
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:52,050
- You came up with that
in an afternoon?
- It took him six years.

112
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:54,069
You're a killjoy, Webber.

113
00:05:54,171 --> 00:05:57,455
I didn't really come
here for a visit.

114
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:01,593
I have aortic and mitral
stenosis with tricuspid regurg.

115
00:06:01,678 --> 00:06:05,947
I need a double valve
replacement and tricuspid repair.

116
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,550
Are you sure?

117
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:13,588
Charts, echoes,

118
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,657
chest X-rays...
everything you need.

119
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:21,696
I may have invented the modified
bypass, but I can't operate on myself.

120
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,132
And my colleagues won't touch me

121
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:27,419
because I have chronic
a-fib, pulmonary hypertension

122
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,471
and a clot in my left atrium.

123
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:32,207
They think if they
operate, they'll kill me.

124
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:35,660
What makes you think we'll
do it, if your colleagues won't?

125
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,162
I didn't start their careers.

126
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:41,933
They can say no
to me. Webber can't.

127
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,426
Absolutely not.

128
00:06:52,528 --> 00:06:54,746
- Now, hold on...
- Have you read the file?

129
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:57,199
His arterial pressure
is through the roof.

130
00:06:57,301 --> 00:07:00,185
- He's aware of the risk.
- Well, in that case, fine.

131
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:01,703
What was I so worried about?

132
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:04,972
I may go down in history as the
surgeon who killed Walter Tapley,

133
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:08,410
- but at least they're
writing about me.
- Erica, sit down.

134
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:15,161
Let me tell you a story. Thirty-eight
years ago, when I was a...

135
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,285
I'm sorry. Is this
gonna be a story about

136
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:21,055
how you were a struggling black med
student who wanted to be a surgeon

137
00:07:21,157 --> 00:07:23,925
and no one would give you a
chance and Walter Tapley did?

138
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:27,161
He mentored you, without him
you wouldn't be in this hospital?

139
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,064
- Yes.
- I'm still not gonna
operate on him.

140
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,620
I thought the sex was mind-blowing, but
I get the impression you had a bad time.

141
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,489
- What?
- Why are you avoiding me?

142
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:41,076
I'm sorry. I lost a patient.
I'm not trying to avoid you.

143
00:07:41,178 --> 00:07:44,279
Not calling me after sex
is you being a lifesaver?

144
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,981
- It is.
- So I'll see you later?

145
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:51,002
You didn't call her?

146
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:54,155
When was the last time you
called a woman after having sex?

147
00:07:54,257 --> 00:07:56,791
Well, that's gonna change.
I'm turning over a new leaf.

148
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,495
What was wrong with the old leaf?
They called you a whore, you're happy.

149
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:03,765
Walter Tapley needs a double
valve replacement and Hahn refuses.

150
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,833
- What?
- Thinks she's gonna kill him.

151
00:08:05,936 --> 00:08:08,503
- Lightweight.
- Since when do surgeons
turn me down?

152
00:08:08,605 --> 00:08:12,373
- It's her choice. She's opening him up.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

153
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:16,027
Another thing. If you spend the night
with a woman, call her the next day,

154
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:19,308
she doesn't call back, does
that mean she had a lousy time

155
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,900
or her answering machine
was consumed in a fire?

156
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,936
- Chief calls the next day.
- You don't have to call.

157
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,356
You just met this person.
It's new, it's fun, it's casual.

158
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,041
- It's my wife.
- Oh!

159
00:08:30,126 --> 00:08:33,278
- Do I call again?
- Well, another call looks
desperate.

160
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,248
Send her an e-mail. Invite her to
dinner. Just be casual, confident.

161
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,350
Sexy.

162
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:41,903
- I mean, romantic.
- Mmm.

163
00:08:42,005 --> 00:08:44,705
- O'Malley!
- Yes, sir.

164
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:48,042
Tapley's in 2062. He's getting an
EKG and an echo. I assigned Yang.

165
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:50,394
All right. Oh, one more thing.

166
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:57,035
I know I said I wouldn't use you to get
my wife back, but I am a desperate man.

167
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:58,803
- Lay it on me.
- Draft an e-mail.

168
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,773
Ask her to dinner.
No, no. Don't ask her.

169
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,658
Tell her. She
likes a strong hand.

170
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,494
You want me to ask your wife
on a date with a strong hand.

171
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:08,780
- Confident. Casual.
- Confident. Casual.

172
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,382
Sexy. Tell her...

173
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:15,270
Tell her the train is leaving
the station, she'd better get on it.

174
00:09:15,372 --> 00:09:17,188
Yeah.

175
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,225
- Can I talk to you? About Rebecca?
- I'm busy.

176
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:25,196
Alex, I gave her a pregnancy
test last week. She's not pregnant.

177
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,648
- I wanted to tell you.
- You're telling me now.

178
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,918
When I told her, she...
she said I was wrong.

179
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,488
She thinks it's some
false negative. It isn't.

180
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,740
She was puking and her
boobs are all blown up.

181
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:38,287
- I ran it twice.
- Well, labs are wrong
all the time.

182
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:42,730
You're wrong all the time! Mind your
own business and stay out of my life!

183
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,152
You have my chart
and I prefer you didn't,

184
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,171
because I fired you.
Can I have my chart?

185
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:52,773
It's not appropriate to
show up unannounced.

186
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:54,292
You didn't fire me, you quit.

187
00:09:54,378 --> 00:09:57,612
So, if you would like to
un-quit, make an appointment.

188
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,532
You know...

189
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:05,119
Make an appointment,
Grey, it's what we do.

190
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,210
At the moment no
surgery's scheduled,

191
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,873
so focus on keeping him
stable and comfortable.

192
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,282
Anything he wants. He
wants a steak, kill a cow.

193
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,334
Karev, bedside PFTs and an ABG.

194
00:10:20,437 --> 00:10:24,872
Yang, run a
central line... Sorry.

195
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:28,543
Damn daycare pages me
every time he gets a runny nose.

196
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:31,428
Find out what they want. I
need Bailey focused on Tapley.

197
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,497
- To the daycare?
- Quickly.

198
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,432
Right man for the job.

199
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,870
Grey. Tapley
needs a central line.

200
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,006
Do it.

201
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:44,091
- I don't understand.
- Take a needle,

202
00:10:44,193 --> 00:10:47,295
jab it into his subclavian so he
can receive medicine and not croak.

203
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:51,532
- A central line.
- But I've never done one! Dr. Yang?

204
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,069
Hey! How'd it go with Greta?

205
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:56,471
- I haven't spoken to her yet.
- You haven't?

206
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,074
I mixed the virus and the
IL-2. We have six hours.

207
00:10:59,176 --> 00:11:01,576
We're not gonna wait
six, we're gonna wait three.

208
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:04,128
The guy we're waiting
for doesn't exist.

209
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,847
I want to give her a little
more time to enjoy him.

210
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,749
Or the idea of
him, if nothing else.

211
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:11,085
We remove the tumor,
it's gonna disappear.

212
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:14,622
It's not real. It's OK if it disappears,
she can go back to her life.

213
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:17,725
She was probably a lonely person.
She found a way to have love.

214
00:11:17,828 --> 00:11:21,846
Of course, because that's where
love exists. In delusional fantasies.

215
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,964
Real love isn't like that.

216
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,518
Good to know.

217
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:35,104
He punched someone
named Harrison.

218
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,895
You punched a child?

219
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:39,325
There was a graham
cracker involved.

220
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:40,915
Over a graham cracker?

221
00:11:41,017 --> 00:11:43,062
They said they want
you to talk to him.

222
00:11:43,086 --> 00:11:45,720
He's 14 months old. What
do they think I'm gonna do,

223
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:47,989
lecture on nonviolent
conflict resolution?

224
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:49,971
- I really don't know.
- Uh...

225
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:53,477
My son punches
children. Perfect!

226
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:58,065
Hey! Dr. Yang, who's even more evil
than usual, asked me to do a central line.

227
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:00,602
This is the big day that
could change things for me.

228
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:02,936
In there is Tapley
and Tapley is God.

229
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,773
I'm the chief's intern, that
makes me close to God,

230
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:09,410
which means I can't help you right
now, as un-Christian as that may sound.

231
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:13,364
No. I'll do Tapley's line. So I
puncture his lung, he'll get over it.

232
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,700
She wants you to do
Tapley's line? I'll do it.

233
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:19,487
Yay! Yay for Georgie.
Georgie saves the day.

234
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:22,551
I give you Tapley and you
pass it over to your intern?

235
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,075
What the hell is wrong with you?

236
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:27,345
Do you think if you kiss the
chief's ass by taking care of Tapley,

237
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:30,247
something magical's
gonna happen? Like what?

238
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,601
You'll earn your magical
resident wings? Well, no.

239
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:36,571
No, not gonna happen,
George. You're stuck.

240
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,422
You are where you are.

241
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,292
The only way out of your
situation is if Burke were here

242
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,294
because you were Burke's guy.

243
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:47,748
For some reason he pitied your
pathetic ass, but he's gone now.

244
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,850
No wings for Georgie.

245
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,974
Was I happy when I was with her?

246
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:59,644
- Off and on.
- I think I idealize it.

247
00:12:59,729 --> 00:13:02,897
I mean, you wouldn't hang on
to a woman who's unavailable,

248
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:05,833
unpredictable, right? You'd
move on, keep it casual.

249
00:13:05,935 --> 00:13:09,520
Don't sell yourself short. Allow
yourself to grow with Rose.

250
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:13,991
- Share experiences. Build memories.
- Is this the new leaf?

251
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,228
- Yeah.
- Needs work.

252
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,131
Oh, my God. This
is gonna kill me.

253
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:24,118
Nice work. You found the
subclavian on the first try.

254
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,886
Got yourself a good resident.

255
00:13:25,988 --> 00:13:29,773
- Actually, sir, I'm an intern.
- The best intern
in the hospital.

256
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:34,495
O'Malley, start Dr. Tapley on
a loading dose of Amiodarone,

257
00:13:34,597 --> 00:13:37,598
- followed by a continuous infusion.
- - Yes, sir.

258
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,967
Why the hell would he
start me on Amiodarone?

259
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,521
O'Leary, would you give Amiodarone
to a man who's about to have

260
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:47,842
- an open-heart procedure?
- George, wait outside, please?

261
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:54,398
If you can't get the
head of cardiothoracics

262
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,134
to do a valve replacement,

263
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,469
then you're not the
chief I thought you were.

264
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,889
And this is not the
facility I thought it was,

265
00:14:01,992 --> 00:14:04,291
so maybe it's
better for all of us

266
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:07,528
if I don't get cut open here.
Would you get these lines off me?

267
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,397
Would you get back in that bed?

268
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:15,486
I'll talk to her again.

269
00:14:19,342 --> 00:14:21,775
You're not even gonna
watch the Tapley surgery?

270
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:25,913
I don't want five minutes with
Walter Tapley. I want five years.

271
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:28,867
Tapley's a star-maker.
That's why the chief's a star.

272
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:32,987
Five minutes is a slap in the face,
like giving an alcoholic a sip of wine.

273
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:37,008
Lexie's coming over. Let's try to
keep the carnage to a minimum.

274
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,378
Hey, can I talk to
you about something?

275
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:44,431
- Maybe some other time.
- Uh, but...

276
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:49,069
Look, you know, she hates you. OK?
She's not going to say it to your face.

277
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:53,340
She's too polite. But you're annoying.
Showing up here like the good girl

278
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:56,711
Daddy didn't abandon is the worst
that's happened to her in months.

279
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,714
And that's saying a lot
coming from Meredith Grey.

280
00:15:07,924 --> 00:15:11,042
- It's gonna be OK.
- Wanna bet?

281
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,046
Mm.

282
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,248
Two minutes, I'll meet
you in the on-call room.

283
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,567
We're gonna sit and
enjoy a meal together.

284
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,186
- I don't get it.
- I turned over a new leaf.

285
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:25,172
From now on, if you want
this, you're gonna get this too.

286
00:15:25,274 --> 00:15:26,724
Ew.

287
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:31,228
Shove over, Sloan. Torres and I
are gonna share a Sapphic salad.

288
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:34,348
- Did I miss something?
- Yeah, we're lovers. Didn't you know?

289
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,084
It's a love that dare
not speak its name.

290
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,571
Uh-hm. Look me in the eye and tell me
you're not thinking about a threesome.

291
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,007
I'm not. Old Mark
would, but that's no more.

292
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:46,794
Really? You're not thinking
about her and me and you

293
00:15:46,896 --> 00:15:49,097
and a video camera.

294
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,802
- On-call room,
ten minutes.
- No!

295
00:15:54,904 --> 00:15:58,455
- I am the chief of surgery.
- I am not killing
Walter Tapley,

296
00:15:58,557 --> 00:15:59,735
I don't care who you are.

297
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,592
- Should I leave?
- No.

298
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:05,829
He's dying anyhow. You'd rather see
him die on my watch than under your knife?

299
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:07,465
- Yes.
- I should leave.

300
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,434
No. Is something going on with
all the women that when I speak,

301
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:14,522
they simply ignore it? You don't
leave. You review the file again.

302
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:19,226
If you see my wife, tell her the
polite thing to do is return a man's call.

303
00:16:22,865 --> 00:16:25,566
See, a tumor in the
temporal lobe can blur the line

304
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:27,868
between imagination and reality.

305
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:31,972
It's possible that Andre
is part of that confusion.

306
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,878
She likes being the successful
sister with a husband and kids,

307
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,975
while I'm the
single, pathetic one

308
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,034
who has to send herself
flowers on Valentine's Day.

309
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,736
I found someone. And
she can't deal with it.

310
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,040
- But there are
no pictures of him.
- You want a picture?

311
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,260
There. There.

312
00:16:53,362 --> 00:16:55,946
And there. And there.

313
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,783
Those are drawings made
from images in your head.

314
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:02,186
- I'm an artist,
that's what I do.
- The journals and writing?

315
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:04,489
- Did you do that before?
- Leave her alone.

316
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:06,935
I didn't have anything
to write about before.

317
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,543
There's a symptom
called hypergraphia.

318
00:17:09,646 --> 00:17:11,728
- It's compulsive...
- Leave her alone.

319
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,431
I'm in love with a man.

320
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:17,584
I've touched him and held him. He
is not a figment of my imagination.

321
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:19,536
Tell them how you met.

322
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:23,807
I was on a cruise around the Greek
Islands and we'd stopped at Santorini.

323
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,326
I was running to get to the
ship and my shoe fell off.

324
00:17:26,428 --> 00:17:29,079
The horn was blowing,
so I didn't stop. I left it.

325
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:33,450
That night, at dinner, Andre
found me. He had my shoe.

326
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,421
- Sound familiar?
- You're mocking me.

327
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,739
No, I'm not. I'm trying
to make you see.

328
00:17:38,842 --> 00:17:41,909
Dr. Shepherd, does anything
about that sound familiar?

329
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:45,045
Sounds like<i> Cinderella.</i>

330
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:48,216
What else happened on the boat?

331
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,551
- Greta.
- I had my first blackouts.

332
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,598
Andre was there.
He carried me to...

333
00:17:52,622 --> 00:17:55,239
A woman found you on
the floor of the bathroom.

334
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:58,425
- Prince Charming
didn't carry you...
- All of you, get out!

335
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:00,561
This is stupid, stupid!

336
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:05,917
Stupid conversation.

337
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:08,536
Greta, the serum that
we use to kill the tumor,

338
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:11,906
- it only lasts
a few hours. So...
- Is it going to expire by 3:00?

339
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,008
No, it is not.

340
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:17,161
- Dr. Shepherd...
- It is not.

341
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:22,215
We can wait until 3:00. We can't
wait all day, but we can wait until 3:00.

342
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,374
Hey, you! How's the...?

343
00:18:35,664 --> 00:18:39,533
Some of my best work. Any
pulling around the suture lines?

344
00:18:39,635 --> 00:18:42,820
No. It's perfect. I'm just not
sure if it goes with the body.

345
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:46,957
See what I mean?

346
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:51,545
Face is a head turner, but the boobs
aren't stopping anybody on the street.

347
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,800
You can close the gown.

348
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:59,469
It doesn't match! Doesn't go with my
face, doesn't go with my personality.

349
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,840
- It's all wrong.
- Didn't you tell me
you were pregnant?

350
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:06,794
I don't need a lecture. I just
need you to finish what you started.

351
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,046
Can you do that?

352
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,837
- I need to talk to you.
- Make an appointment!

353
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:20,057
I don't want an appointment,
just my chart back. Get it now.

354
00:19:20,142 --> 00:19:24,328
I'd like to go to the bathroom in
peace. Everybody's dissatisfied here.

355
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,231
Where do you get off
suggesting I'm a coward, a quitter?

356
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,834
Are you trying to make me
feel bad so you can fix me?

357
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:33,537
- Talk about
it in therapy.
- No! I don't need therapy!

358
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,873
- I forgive you.
- Lexie.

359
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,910
No. I forgive you. I forgive
you for treating me like crap

360
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,046
and letting your friend
treat me like crap.

361
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:44,031
- Lexie.
- I don't know how you get up.

362
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:47,151
I honestly don't. Our
dad abandoned you.

363
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:50,087
Your mom, by all accounts,
was the meanest person ever.

364
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,123
You can't let Derek love
you and it all really sucks.

365
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:57,094
But ever since I knew you existed, I
had this fantasy about my big sister.

366
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,098
And you have failed, on every
occasion, to live up to that fantasy.

367
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,352
But I still love you, whether you
are capable of letting me or not.

368
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,939
So... I forgive you.

369
00:20:11,027 --> 00:20:13,060
- 2:00 work for you?
- Yeah, OK.

370
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,880
If this man dies under my
knife, Richard, so help me,

371
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:21,135
I will tell every reporter in the
land that you insisted we do this.

372
00:20:21,237 --> 00:20:24,371
- You will look like an idiot.
- Relax! I'll be fine.

373
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,991
She has impeccable judgment.

374
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:33,097
And this may be the
dumbest thing I've ever done.

375
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:39,202
Ted Ginsburg
would have done this.

376
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:44,191
But I wanted a friend, in case I went
into the OR and didn't come back.

377
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:47,094
I wanted an old
friend to say goodbye.

378
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:52,366
- I'm honored.
- Don't be.

379
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:56,620
I should have had a wife

380
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,457
and a bunch of kids...

381
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:03,994
so I wouldn't have to track you down
to get someone to be at my deathbed.

382
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:11,919
Stevens. What are you
treating Rebecca Pope for?

383
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,555
A pregnancy she doesn't
have but thinks she does.

384
00:21:14,657 --> 00:21:16,891
Doesn't one of you have
science on your side?

385
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:18,626
Yes. She is acting really weird.

386
00:21:18,728 --> 00:21:21,695
She wants breast enhancement
surgery. She thinks her new face

387
00:21:21,797 --> 00:21:24,548
doesn't match her body.
May be acute stress disorder.

388
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:28,252
It happens when people have
massive plastic surgeries and trauma.

389
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:31,884
You look in the mirror, you're
not sure you are the same person.

390
00:21:31,908 --> 00:21:33,391
It can lead to odd behavior.

391
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:36,877
Thinking you're pregnant when
you're not, forgetting you have a baby?

392
00:21:36,979 --> 00:21:40,414
Make it clear to her she's not
pregnant and get her a psych consult.

393
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:42,583
- And have psych call me.
- OK.

394
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,202
Here you are, chief.

395
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,439
Read that to me. I can't see
anything on that tiny screen.

396
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,575
- Oh, no, that's a bad idea.
- Speak up, O'Malley.

397
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,929
"Dear Adele, eat with me.

398
00:21:56,031 --> 00:21:58,866
The love train is
leaving the station.

399
00:21:58,968 --> 00:22:01,435
- You know you want
to take a ride."
- O'Malley!

400
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:04,271
"Take a ride on
my love train..."

401
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:06,574
Sir, I didn't come up with
the train or the station.

402
00:22:06,676 --> 00:22:10,311
- Give that to me. I'll do it myself.
- Yes.

403
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:12,624
Hey, so, let me
get this straight.

404
00:22:12,648 --> 00:22:16,617
If I wander into an on-call room,
you are not gonna follow me?

405
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:20,554
You ever think about why you need sex
all the time? Is it replacing something?

406
00:22:20,656 --> 00:22:22,901
I use it to clear my head. So...

407
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,825
on-call room.

408
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,378
We can sit there and talk,
but we're not having sex.

409
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,013
Why? What are we
gonna talk about?

410
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,098
At lunch, you wanted
to talk threesomes.

411
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,334
You are so not a new man.

412
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,687
I mean, I guess if you
had to have a threesome,

413
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,973
Erica Hahn wouldn't
be a bad choice, right?

414
00:22:39,075 --> 00:22:40,524
She brings that whole,

415
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:44,228
"We're naughty, getting sent to
the principal's office" thing to it.

416
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:49,366
You never thought about reaching across
the OR table and pulling down her mask,

417
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:52,536
ripping off her scrub
cap, so that you can grab

418
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:55,122
a handful of that blonde hair...

419
00:22:55,224 --> 00:22:59,026
Stop! Stop talking
about Erica Hahn.

420
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,578
Forget it.

421
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:05,799
Everything all right?

422
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:10,504
One of the founding fathers of
cardiothoracic surgery is on the table

423
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:13,757
and I'm about to slice open
his chest. Give me a minute.

424
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:18,328
OK, scalpel.

425
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,900
Don't screw it up.

426
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,669
I'm gonna kill you.

427
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:29,589
We've got this patient.

428
00:23:29,691 --> 00:23:32,960
And she's got true love.
Do you want to know why?

429
00:23:33,062 --> 00:23:35,346
Because her
boyfriend doesn't exist.

430
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,981
Derek is all broken up over her,

431
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:42,085
like it means something that she's
having an affair with a hallucination.

432
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:45,372
Derek wasn't ready to give up
on the relationship, you were.

433
00:23:45,474 --> 00:23:49,643
No, I didn't give up. I wanted to try
again. And then he went and kissed Rose.

434
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:52,213
So he's the one who
messes up. Not me.

435
00:23:52,315 --> 00:23:55,315
But it's a relationship.
People make mistakes.

436
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:59,970
And you stand back, waiting for him to
fail so you can say, "A-ha! Now I quit."

437
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:01,555
No! It wasn't working.

438
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:04,758
Was life not working when you
let that slip out from under you?

439
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,361
When are you gonna stop
suggesting I'm suicidal?

440
00:24:07,462 --> 00:24:10,147
When you act like somebody
that wants to be alive.

441
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:11,831
- Give me my chart!
- Why?

442
00:24:11,934 --> 00:24:14,401
I'm not suicidal. If it
says that, it's wrong.

443
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,799
What happened when
you fell in the water?

444
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:18,422
I almost drowned.
I did that for kicks?

445
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:22,943
You put your hand in a body cavity
that contained unexploded ordinance.

446
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,278
I was trying to save a patient!

447
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,649
Why is it that every other person in
that room had the sense to hit the deck?

448
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:33,820
You know, people run away from
this line between life and death.

449
00:24:33,923 --> 00:24:37,124
You seem to stand on it
and wait for a strong wind

450
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,546
to sway you one
way or the other.

451
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:42,546
You're careless with your life.

452
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,415
You're not slitting your
wrists, but you're careless.

453
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:49,052
Probably because your mother
told you you were a waste of space.

454
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,955
The problem is you believed
her. If you don't watch out,

455
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:55,225
one of these days you're
gonna die because of it.

456
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,030
Hand me my chart.

457
00:25:01,383 --> 00:25:02,900
Now!

458
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:13,109
And don't ever talk
about my mother again.

459
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:20,283
What the hell is...?

460
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,736
There's a leak. Go
back on bypass now!

461
00:25:22,838 --> 00:25:25,038
Take clamps off the
aortic and venous lines.

462
00:25:25,074 --> 00:25:28,275
- Grey, take the suction.
- The left atrium is torn

463
00:25:28,377 --> 00:25:31,394
where that clot was adhered.
Metzenbaum scissors!

464
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:34,647
This was a mistake. It was
irresponsible and stupid,

465
00:25:34,749 --> 00:25:37,167
and I cannot believe I
let you talk me into it!

466
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:40,104
My reputation's gonna
be in the toilet at the end.

467
00:25:40,189 --> 00:25:43,324
Dan Slocum at Mercy is
gonna have a field day with this,

468
00:25:43,426 --> 00:25:45,375
- condescending tool that he is.
- Erica.

469
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:49,663
Don't "Erica" me, Richard. It's not
your good name we're gonna destroy,

470
00:25:49,765 --> 00:25:53,934
- much as I wish that it was.
- Dr. Hahn, it's done.

471
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,308
No leak. The repair's holding.

472
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:05,763
You were saying?

473
00:26:07,282 --> 00:26:09,950
<i>♪ Today ♪</i>

474
00:26:14,857 --> 00:26:18,125
<i>♪ You were far away ♪</i>

475
00:26:25,433 --> 00:26:28,035
<i>♪ And I ♪</i>

476
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,875
<i>♪ Didn't ask you why ♪</i>

477
00:26:34,977 --> 00:26:36,576
Is that clock right?

478
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,545
I'm sure it is.

479
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:45,401
Maybe his plane was delayed.

480
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:49,339
His phone is off. Maybe his phone
is off because he's still on the plane.

481
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,775
He's coming!

482
00:27:00,936 --> 00:27:02,352
Here.

483
00:27:04,774 --> 00:27:07,841
- My head did this?
- No.

484
00:27:07,943 --> 00:27:10,043
Your tumor did this.

485
00:27:14,082 --> 00:27:16,250
He was never there?

486
00:27:22,124 --> 00:27:23,823
Oh, God.

487
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,144
Oh, God!

488
00:27:35,204 --> 00:27:37,571
How can he not be real?

489
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:41,224
I'm sorry.

490
00:27:52,521 --> 00:27:54,187
Oh, God!

491
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,679
Hey, there, baby boy!

492
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,065
You managed to make
it through the day?

493
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:09,753
Our son has been
punching other children.

494
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,055
- Yeah, I know.
- What do you mean, you know?

495
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:16,192
It's happened before.
I'm dealing with it.

496
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:20,363
Wait. I had to bribe the director of
the daycare center to get him back in.

497
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:24,534
I had to bring apple slices and give
free mammograms to the teachers.

498
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:27,371
Now, why aren't you
telling me what's happening?

499
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:31,091
I don't judge how you do surgery,
don't judge how I deal with the baby.

500
00:28:31,193 --> 00:28:33,710
You didn't deal. He's
punching other children!

501
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:36,463
Of course he's punching!
He used to be with me all day.

502
00:28:36,565 --> 00:28:40,417
Now, he's in day care so he spends
ten minutes with you every three hours.

503
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:42,669
So that's making him violent?

504
00:28:42,771 --> 00:28:46,773
Hey, Tuck! Hey! Can I take
him to say hi for a minute?

505
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:51,811
- Uh... Yeah, sure, sure.
- Want to play with
the office supplies?

506
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:58,285
Look, if you can't communicate
well enough to tell me...

507
00:28:58,387 --> 00:29:01,907
Don't lecture me, Miranda
Bailey. I'm not one of your students.

508
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:05,509
With all the time you spend
here, it's hard to differentiate.

509
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:10,013
No, I spend my time here
because I'm building a life for us!

510
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:12,532
I spend time here because
I don't have the luxury

511
00:29:12,634 --> 00:29:15,885
of being able to take a year
off and spend it with our child,

512
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:19,089
knowing my career's waiting
for me when I'm ready to go back!

513
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:21,558
Luxury? So you think
spending all day every day

514
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,645
wiping noses and
changing diapers is a luxury?

515
00:29:24,747 --> 00:29:27,180
No, I think it's a beautiful
thing that you get to do.

516
00:29:27,282 --> 00:29:29,883
- You take it for granted!
- Take it for granted?

517
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:31,701
- Yes!
- I take our family for granted?

518
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:33,564
- I did not say...
- You did say!

519
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:35,906
- You did say!
- I work because we...

520
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:38,508
- You love your work!
- And I love my family, too!

521
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,144
It is going to be OK.

522
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:45,715
Uncle George says
it is going to be OK.

523
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,871
This happened when I
was a kid. I'd get a strep test,

524
00:29:50,973 --> 00:29:52,189
it'd come back negative.

525
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:56,176
Look. OK, that's your uterus.
There is nothing in there.

526
00:29:56,278 --> 00:29:58,428
No fetus, no sac. Nothing.

527
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:02,210
But it's too early. It's tiny,
you can't see anything yet.

528
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,487
- What the hell are you doing?
- I paged you 20 minutes ago.

529
00:30:08,624 --> 00:30:11,091
Rebecca, look. OK?

530
00:30:11,193 --> 00:30:15,629
This is a fetus at six weeks.
Right? It's a tiny spot, but it's there,

531
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,030
you can see it.

532
00:30:17,132 --> 00:30:20,450
Look at your uterus, there's
nothing there. Nothing.

533
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,953
Get out.

534
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,757
Here are her labs. There's
a chart note from Dr. Sloan.

535
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:31,478
- I can get a psych consult
if you want.
- Look, just get out!

536
00:30:35,016 --> 00:30:37,067
What?

537
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:40,987
There's no baby.

538
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,958
- I lost the baby?
- No, you weren't pregnant.

539
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:49,479
If you had been pregnant, your beta-HCG
level would be elevated. It's zero.

540
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,532
You didn't miscarry,
there never was a baby.

541
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,454
I can't believe I lost our baby.

542
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:00,674
Rebecca. You're not hearing me.

543
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,460
I'm so sorry.

544
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:08,014
I'm so... I'm so
sorry I lost our baby.

545
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:13,820
Shh. It's OK.

546
00:31:13,922 --> 00:31:15,672
You're gonna be OK, all right?

547
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:21,912
Remember, we need to
stay in synch. Ready? Go.

548
00:31:23,064 --> 00:31:25,064
Good. Easy, slow, slow down.

549
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:28,552
Right there, right there. Good.

550
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:31,371
Pressure's rising, she's
getting bradycardic.

551
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:35,441
So let's push one gram per kilo
of Mannitol, 20 Lasix, see if we can

552
00:31:35,544 --> 00:31:37,577
avoid increased ICP.

553
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,454
Is there a problem, Dr. Grey?

554
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,275
Andre's here.

555
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:09,659
You run everywhere, or is
it just you're scared of me?

556
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:13,713
- I'm trying to stay
on top of things.
- You're doing a fine job.

557
00:32:13,815 --> 00:32:15,665
It's very impressive work.

558
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:22,005
Sir, if you would mention to
the chief you like my work?

559
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,090
I was held back as an intern.

560
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:27,127
There was some
personal... stuff.

561
00:32:27,229 --> 00:32:30,913
I'm good. And if you would
say something to him...

562
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:34,918
Webber would not have
made that decision lightly.

563
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,487
Learning is like healing.

564
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,789
It happens over time.

565
00:32:43,512 --> 00:32:46,646
Listen. Keep running.

566
00:32:46,748 --> 00:32:49,266
But not because you
want to cut corners,

567
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:52,986
because it makes
you a better doctor.

568
00:32:53,088 --> 00:32:54,498
- You're not
supposed to be talking.

569
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:56,923
- O'Leary and I
were just marveling

570
00:32:57,025 --> 00:32:59,192
at the fact that you
haven't killed me yet.

571
00:32:59,294 --> 00:33:01,261
Well, there's always tomorrow.

572
00:33:01,363 --> 00:33:04,809
Check his post-op echo, make
sure there's no residual prolapse.

573
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:06,650
Yes, sir.

574
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:17,394
♪ Someday my pain ♪

575
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:23,516
♪ Someday my pain ♪

576
00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:27,988
- Are you OK?
- Don't ask me if I'm OK.

577
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,433
OK.

578
00:33:29,457 --> 00:33:32,458
You make me sick.
Have some fire.

579
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,994
Be unstoppable.
Be a force of nature.

580
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:39,449
Be better than anyone here and
don't give a damn what anyone thinks.

581
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:42,785
There are no teams
here. No buddies.

582
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:45,622
You're on your
own. Be on your own.

583
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:56,066
Dr. Yang, I just scrubbed in on Walter
Tapley's double valve replacement.

584
00:33:56,168 --> 00:34:01,571
I watched Dr. Hahn excise a piece of
his pericardium from three inches away.

585
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:04,991
That's what I got to do while
you made notes in charts.

586
00:34:05,093 --> 00:34:08,327
So whatever crap you want to
rain down on my head, go for it.

587
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:11,564
Because I just saw the
inside of Walter Tapley's heart,

588
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:14,734
and that is something you
will never take away from me.

589
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:20,290
Yeah. OK.

590
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,125
OK then.

591
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:31,318
Hey, Tuck! Here's Tapley's
file. The new labs are in there.

592
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,421
- Just put it on the pile.
- Tucker didn't take him?

593
00:34:34,523 --> 00:34:36,973
I wanted the evening with him.

594
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,915
You guys get to the
bottom of anything?

595
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:46,332
Why don't I take Tuck for a couple
hours? You can go talk to him. Go fight.

596
00:34:46,434 --> 00:34:50,520
You're not gonna fix anything in one
day, but you can go on and keep trying.

597
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,895
What are you doing?

598
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:02,499
I need clothes. She's staying with
me. She didn't bring enough stuff.

599
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:05,068
- Did you call her husband?
- She doesn't want to.

600
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,803
Did you get a psych consult?

601
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:11,758
Alex, she had a hysterical pregnancy.
Sloan thinks she may have a stress...

602
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,571
She's fine, OK? I can handle it.

603
00:35:13,595 --> 00:35:17,713
I'm gonna take care of her. Just
give me some damn girl clothes.

604
00:35:26,307 --> 00:35:28,541
Put your arms up a little bit.

605
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,749
There you go.

606
00:35:40,488 --> 00:35:44,123
Tomorrow's board and Dr. Tapley's
echo. Hahn is seeing him now.

607
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:46,759
What are you doing
with Bailey's child?

608
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,295
Dr. Bailey and I are in love.

609
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:53,165
I'll be heading to Vegas with
her as soon as my divorce is final.

610
00:35:54,469 --> 00:35:56,097
We need to write Adele again.

611
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:58,754
She replied to my e-mail,
but all she sent was a typo.

612
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:01,291
She's no better
at this than I am.

613
00:36:01,393 --> 00:36:03,159
- That's not a
typo, that's a wink.

614
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,589
- A semi-colon and a
closed parentheses?

615
00:36:05,613 --> 00:36:08,314
Turn it sideways.

616
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,933
- What the hell does this mean?
- She's flirting.

617
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:12,385
Oh!

618
00:36:12,487 --> 00:36:14,571
- Oh, that's good!
- Yeah.

619
00:36:15,107 --> 00:36:16,972
O'Malley.

620
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,610
Good work today.

621
00:36:24,232 --> 00:36:28,401
You know what that was?
That was the "attaboy."

622
00:36:28,503 --> 00:36:32,505
This may have been the most exhausting
day of my life, my back is killing me,

623
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:36,910
no offense, and I haven't
seen the inside of an OR in...

624
00:36:37,011 --> 00:36:40,413
I don't know how long,
but I got the attaboy.

625
00:36:40,515 --> 00:36:42,181
I'm turning it around.

626
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:45,351
And you're gonna get the
punching under control, right?

627
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,970
You and me.

628
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:51,874
Boy, it takes us a
while, but we get there.

629
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,279
We reached the tumor.

630
00:36:58,183 --> 00:37:01,585
But there was swelling
in Greta's brain.

631
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:04,087
We did an MRI,

632
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:09,376
and it suggested that the swelling in
her brain caused a great deal of damage.

633
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:12,828
It doesn't look like
she's gonna wake up.

634
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:19,418
Mr. Barret, we're so sorry.

635
00:37:20,722 --> 00:37:23,322
We should have waited.

636
00:37:23,424 --> 00:37:25,424
We didn't think...

637
00:37:27,195 --> 00:37:30,229
I didn't think you were coming.

638
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:35,218
The whole story just
sounded so incredible.

639
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,721
She told you about
the shoe, right?

640
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,259
It makes us both sound crazy.

641
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:48,614
I could never get that
image out of my head...

642
00:37:50,651 --> 00:37:53,285
her running up the
gangplank with one shoe.

643
00:37:53,387 --> 00:37:55,154
Wind in her hair.

644
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,374
Most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

645
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,696
She might wake up, right?

646
00:38:02,798 --> 00:38:06,048
I mean, it's been a fairy tale from
the start. They always wake up.

647
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:17,443
<i>Don't wonder why

648
00:38:18,613 --> 00:38:22,782

00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,686

00:38:26,788 --> 00:38:30,306

651
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,526

654
00:38:45,774 --> 00:38:48,274
<i>wonder what the hell it is...</i>

655
00:38:50,011 --> 00:38:52,612
<i>that makes us hold it together.</i>

656
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:07,711
Ladies.

657
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,746
He's thinking about a threesome.

658
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,498
- I am not.
- You are.

659
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,936
He has been... all day.

660
00:39:17,038 --> 00:39:20,523
OK, fine. I got a new
leaf, not a lobotomy.

661
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,809
You couldn't
handle the two of us.

662
00:39:22,911 --> 00:39:25,795
Oh, but I could. I
won't, but I could.

663
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:28,514
You wouldn't find
it intimidating?

664
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,182
Not at all.

665
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:45,314
See? Too much for you.

666
00:39:49,737 --> 00:39:53,322
Damn it! On-call
room, right now.

667
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:59,112

00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:12,091
Rose.

672
00:40:14,796 --> 00:40:18,030
- You want go have dinner?
- No, I'm sorry. I can't.

673
00:40:18,132 --> 00:40:20,216
- Oh, come on.
- Derek.

674
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:22,368
We spent a night
together and you vanished.

675
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:26,305
I wish I was secure enough to handle
that without a bruised ego and sugar,

676
00:40:26,408 --> 00:40:28,119
- but I'm not.
- Wait, wait, wait.

677
00:40:28,143 --> 00:40:30,743
Can't we just make this easier?

678
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:32,712
I don't...

679
00:40:32,814 --> 00:40:36,349
Look, I don't want... See,
I've done complicated.

680
00:40:36,451 --> 00:40:38,751
I don't want to do that again.

681
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:40,670
Can't this just be easy?

682
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:44,140
Fun?

683
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,495
We don't need that
fairy tale thing right now.

684
00:40:49,597 --> 00:40:51,463
We just need a little happy.

685
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,967
Hm?

686
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:39,746
My mother tried to kill
herself when I was a kid.

687
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:43,950
After the love of
her life disappeared.

688
00:41:46,621 --> 00:41:49,688
I never told
anybody that before.

689
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:52,658
OK.

690
00:41:54,695 --> 00:41:56,695
So you think I'm broken?

691
00:41:58,066 --> 00:42:00,299
Fix me.

692
00:42:00,401 --> 00:42:02,135
Because I'm no quitter.

693
00:42:04,472 --> 00:42:06,072
Let's go.
