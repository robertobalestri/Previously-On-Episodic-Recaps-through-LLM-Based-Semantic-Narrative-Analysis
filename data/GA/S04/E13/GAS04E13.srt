1
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:08,474
<i>Great surgeons aren't
made, they're born.</i>

2
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:14,013
<i>It takes gestation, incubation,
sacrifice. A lot of sacrifice.</i>

3
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:17,349
<i>But after all the blood and guts
and gooey stuff is washed away,</i>

4
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:20,452
<i>that surgeon you
become? Totally worth it.</i>

5
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:22,787
Welcome back.

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,092
Aah... I am not back. I
am here for a surgery.

7
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,644
I know.

8
00:00:28,746 --> 00:00:34,049
Uh, charts, labs, a security key
card and key to the doctor's lounge.

9
00:00:34,151 --> 00:00:38,454
Ah, look, they used my old
picture. It's like I never left.

10
00:00:38,556 --> 00:00:41,623
- Addie! You're back.
- I am not back.

11
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:45,411
Oh, you're back. You're gonna
smell the stink and sweat of surgery

12
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:46,812
and you're gonna be back.

13
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:49,515
See? Nothing ever
changes around here.

14
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:51,583
- Things change.
- Welcome back.

15
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:54,502
I am not back!

16
00:00:54,604 --> 00:00:58,106
Well, I just had no idea that
sunrise yoga would be so intense.

17
00:00:58,209 --> 00:01:00,042
- Told you.
- Dr. Hahn.

18
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:03,278
I have the 3-D ultrasounds
and MRI's for today's patient.

19
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,131
You decided who's gonna
scrub in? I diagnosed the mother

20
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,184
- when she came in, so...
- Films.

21
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:21,529
First day. My clinical trial.
My baby. All grown up.

22
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:23,198
Nobody cares about your trial

23
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,435
or your sick terminal patients
who'd rather be left for dead.

24
00:01:26,537 --> 00:01:28,320
- You're just jealous.
- Yeah.

25
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,139
Anyone can come up with a
trial. I could come up with one.

26
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:32,819
- Jealous.
- Not that it'd matter

27
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,577
'cause Hahn wouldn't sign
off. Won't even talk to me.

28
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,013
- She enjoyed talking to me.
- About what?

29
00:01:38,115 --> 00:01:41,650
Her hopes. Her dreams. Then
we would braid each other's hair.

30
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:45,253
- Least I'm not living
in the clinic.
- The clinic is my happy place.

31
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,307
Can you use your sparkle pager
to get me on Hahn's surgery?

32
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:52,728
Can't think about the sparkle pager
because my clinical trial starts today.

33
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,696
- Sparkle pager stealer!
- Thank you!

34
00:01:54,798 --> 00:01:57,015
OK. The both of you
need to take a moment,

35
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,217
dig down deep
and you'll discover

36
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,938
you're happy for me that I've
found my path to medical history.

37
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,307
- I'm not happy for her.
- Oh, me neither.

38
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:10,011
Karnofsky score is still 80 and his
CBC and liver enzymes are good.

39
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:12,046
- That's better than expected.
- I know.

40
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:15,501
Doesn't mean good. Don't want
you getting emotionally involved.

41
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:18,331
- Don't want you
getting hopes up.
- My hopes are not up.

42
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:20,605
All right then,
Dr. Grey. Let's do this.

43
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,741
- OK.
- Good. Chart, please.

44
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:26,979
Hey!

45
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:28,680
- Hey.
- Hey.

46
00:02:28,765 --> 00:02:30,582
- Hey! Come here, you!
- Hey!

47
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:33,368
Whoo!

48
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,855
Wow, it's... Wow, it's
great to see you guys.

49
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,535
- How's L.A.?
- Yeah, it is.

50
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:41,676
It's great, it's fun. It's
the sun and surfing. It's...

51
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:43,345
You surf?

52
00:02:44,014 --> 00:02:45,346
No, I don't surf.

53
00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:48,700
Anyway... Hey, look, I hugged
you there! Did you see that?

54
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:51,770
You stole my husband from
me, I hugged you. I've grown.

55
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:56,191
I have and I can be
happy for the happy couple.

56
00:02:56,293 --> 00:03:02,263
Right? I'm all "L.A." and like,
one with myself, so I feel really...

57
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:04,299
- Yeah.
- Mmm...

58
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:07,669
OK, well, I'm going
to go save a life now.

59
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,190
Really great... Great to
see you. Really. Cheers.

60
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,876
- Happy couple?
- See you after rounds.

61
00:03:17,914 --> 00:03:20,548
- Hey.
- There she is!

62
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:23,368
Just coming in to check
on my patient's skin flap.

63
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:28,039
Amazing, right? Pulled a couple
of stem cells from the baby in utero,

64
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:32,044
six weeks later, I have
grown skin. Like God.

65
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,613
- Nice.
- What do you say
we lock that door

66
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,614
and tear one off
for old time's sake?

67
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,594
This place is exactly the same.

68
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,619
You are exactly the same.

69
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,773
Except now I grow skin
for babies. Like God.

70
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,726
Come on, I'm horny. The
nurses are shutting me down.

71
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,696
Aww. Thanks for my skin flap.

72
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:53,632
- That a euphemism?
- Nope.

73
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:57,302
- I am so coding.
- Coding hard.

74
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:01,139
What is that? Complaining? If you're
gonna complain, do it to my face.

75
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,893
Fine. There's nothing to do.
Can we go to the pit or something?

76
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:08,463
You're down here to learn
patient care, bedside manner

77
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:12,734
and a whole host of things you
cannot learn in the pit. So suck it up!

78
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:16,821
Hi. I'm Dr. Stevens. What
seems to be your problem?

79
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,408
- We...
- My wife thinks
she may be pregnant.

80
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,194
- OK, we'll get you a test.
- Code.

81
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,648
Excuse me, won't you?

82
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:31,352
What is wrong with you people?
What is that smell? Is that...

83
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,556
- That Scotch?
- It's seeping out
of Leo's pores.

84
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:37,578
You're hung-over?
You're all hung-over?

85
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:40,361
- Don't blame us,
blame O'Malley.
- George?

86
00:04:40,463 --> 00:04:43,331
- He and Lexie Grey had a party.
- George had a party?

87
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,953
You're about to
experience medical history,

88
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,256
medical greatness,
medical majesty.

89
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:54,776
About to experience the beginning
of something extraordinary.

90
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,344
Take in the moment.

91
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,430
<i>Dr. Cruz to OR Six.</i>

92
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:01,299
OK. Dr. Grey, did you warn
the interns what to expect?

93
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,151
I told them to expect greatness.

94
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:06,204
Yes. In addition to the
greatness, the patient may be

95
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,207
inappropriately emotional,
he's aggressive... abusive.

96
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:14,579
Don't take it personally. OK? Don't
engage. It's the tumor talking. OK?

97
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,515
Mr. Robinson, Mrs. Robinson.
Dr. Grey and I want to say

98
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:21,069
how grateful we are that you've
decided to participate in our trial.

99
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:22,971
I know it's a hard
decision to make.

100
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,306
It is a chance, right?
It's our only chance.

101
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:29,695
If the surgery doesn't
kill me, the tumor will.

102
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:31,596
What have I got to lose, right?

103
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:35,083
As we discussed, the treatment
has never been tested on humans.

104
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:37,819
We're going to inject a
live virus into the tumor.

105
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:41,272
We can't take the tumor out. Our
hope is reduce the tumor from within.

106
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,342
- Dr. O'Malley?
- Over the past month,
Mr. Robinson

107
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:48,863
has experienced vision loss,
increasingly severe headaches that in...

108
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:54,269
Nice, huh? First thing I noticed
about her? Hell of an ass.

109
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:57,339
Like a nice piece of ass? She
could do a little more on top.

110
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,690
He's started picking
out husbands for me.

111
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:03,110
Was anyone talking to you?

112
00:06:04,747 --> 00:06:09,701
- It's the tumor talking.
- Just the tumor talking.

113
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,839
So you single or what?

114
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,745
- Dr. Montgomery.
- Dr. Karev.

115
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:21,863
- Hey.
- Hey.

116
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,127
- We're hugging?
- Yep.

117
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:29,137
I hug now. It's what I do,
so... So you're my guy, huh?

118
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:33,058
You think I'd let anyone
else in on a case like this?

119
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:37,812
- I'll catch up with you
in a second.
- OK.

120
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,419
You... You don't own a phone?

121
00:06:45,522 --> 00:06:48,306
I needed to see you in person.

122
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:52,777
I have a really huge case today. I wish
I could hang out, I really do, but I...

123
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,262
I'm pregnant.

124
00:06:56,516 --> 00:07:00,318
I didn't mean to blurt it,
I'm sorry I blurted it, but I...

125
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,539
You never have time to talk, so I
kind of had no choice but to blurt.

126
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:07,725
Are you keeping it or are
you having an abortion?

127
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,897
I have a really big case.

128
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:27,428
Ectopia cordis. The baby's heart is
growing outside of its body, in utero.

129
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,965
Less than 200 cases
have ever been reported.

130
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:33,535
- Only a handful have survived.
- I was on one of these
ten years ago.

131
00:07:33,637 --> 00:07:36,070
The baby squeezed its
own heart in utero and died.

132
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:38,790
He squeezed his own heart
with his tiny little hands?

133
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:42,276
You said there's a possibility
of a diaphragmatic hernia?

134
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,745
Yeah.

135
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,101
You and I have got a lot of
work to do on this little guy.

136
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,843
- You up for it?
- Always.

137
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:55,306
What about my work? I grew an
amazing flap of the baby's own skin.

138
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,392
Pretend all you want. But
I know you're impressed.

139
00:08:01,464 --> 00:08:03,865
You!

140
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:06,334
- What's up, Bro'Malley?
- You.

141
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,907
Hey, you paged me?

142
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:16,093
O'Malley! What's up, party dude?

143
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,262
Know what I did last night?

144
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:21,466
I googled recipes. I spent
the night with a search engine.

145
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:24,080
But... That was just...
It was so spontaneous.

146
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:27,772
I... didn't think you'd want
to hang out with interns.

147
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,175
- Code.
- Code!

148
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,820
- What is that?
- It's just something
we came up...

149
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:36,097
Well, he came up
with it. "You coded."

150
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:38,249
- You coded!
- You coded.

151
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:40,568
It was really funny after
seven or eight shots.

152
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:45,907
- Hey! So we're all set
for tonight.
- Tonight? What's tonight?

153
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:51,979
Oh, um... The interns, we're just
having a darts tournament thing at Joe's.

154
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:53,915
Oh, my God, I love darts!

155
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:56,684
- Oh, do you wanna come?
- Yeah! Absolutely! Yey!

156
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,475
You so coded.

157
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:08,625
You know, I don't know, I
thought it'd be weird coming back.

158
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:12,200
Gotta say... I find it
strangely comforting

159
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:15,136
that everything
is the same here.

160
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,673
OK. In L.A., people say things.

161
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:22,376
But in Seattle there's this
strange culture of wordlessness

162
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,907
wherein I'm supposed
to suss what one is feeling

163
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:30,417
by the slight raise of an eyebrow
or the beginnings of a frown.

164
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,755
Any chance you want to tell me
what's going on with you, Miranda?

165
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:39,127
Just... a lot has changed
since you left. Just a lot.

166
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:42,146
Come on, name one thing
that has changed in this hospital.

167
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:46,584
The clinic is actually making
money. The Chief's wife left him.

168
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:50,037
Derek and Meredith
broke up. And I...

169
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:54,309
Whoa, whoa. Derek
and Meredith broke up?

170
00:09:54,411 --> 00:09:56,761
Uh, like I said. A lot of
things have changed.

171
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,899
Nikki Jones, 25-year-old
female, 35 weeks pregnant.

172
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,736
Six weeks ago she was
diagnosed with ectopia cordis.

173
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,505
Which, as you know,
means that your baby's heart

174
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,141
is currently growing on
the outside of his body.

175
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:13,478
Which doesn't get any less
bizarre the more times I hear it.

176
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,848
Not bizarre, baby. Just
unique. Our son is one of a kind.

177
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,118
Wearing his heart on his sleeve.

178
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,355
This surgery is going to
take place in two OR's.

179
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,707
- It'll work like a dance.
- Dr. Karev and I

180
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:30,295
- will begin with the delivery.
- I'll stay
to close your incision.

181
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,325
While I bring your
baby to OR Two.

182
00:10:32,349 --> 00:10:34,215
Where I'll work on
your baby's heart.

183
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:37,552
And I'll attend to your
baby's intestinal problem.

184
00:10:37,654 --> 00:10:39,404
Wait. Intestinal problem?

185
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:43,424
We've detected there might be a
slight defect on your baby's diaphragm.

186
00:10:43,526 --> 00:10:46,477
We just want to be prepared
for every contingency.

187
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:50,682
I just wish I could keep him
inside me. Keep him protected.

188
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:55,820
He's protected no matter
what. By us. By our love.

189
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,041
Something about that guy
makes me wanna punch him out.

190
00:11:01,144 --> 00:11:03,611
Yet you didn't, for which
I am grateful, Karev.

191
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:10,534
- Hippies. Annoying, huh?
- Go away.

192
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,040
Hey. How great is she?

193
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:16,835
- She's great.
- Did I tell you?

194
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:18,643
- You told me.
- Did she tell you?

195
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:21,145
- Tell me what?
- Anything. Everything.

196
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,447
Does she know you're divorced?

197
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,216
- You're divorced?
- Yeah.

198
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:26,668
Which, as it turns out...

199
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,704
Was the best thing that
could have happened, really.

200
00:11:29,806 --> 00:11:30,822
No kidding?

201
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,184
- You headed...?
- Yeah.

202
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,075
- I'll walk with you.
- OK.

203
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:43,134
It seems there's been a lot of
change, even since the last checkup.

204
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,303
Behavior's getting more erratic?

205
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:46,805
That's a nice way of putting it.

206
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:50,208
You've been incredibly
strong, Jennifer. This is...

207
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,161
You've been incredibly strong.

208
00:11:54,564 --> 00:11:57,815
If you really want to help, you
could bring some single men by.

209
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:01,252
Phillip. Please stop.

210
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:04,755
Jennifer, we're in a hospital
full of eligible doctors,

211
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,141
and you're a waitress
with no prospects,

212
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:11,696
who needs to learn how to use her ass
to catch a new guy before I bite the dust!

213
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,585
It's just the tumor talking.

214
00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:23,340
- It's just the tumor talking.
- It is. It's just the tumor talking.

215
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,847
And he's laughing again
because the idea of me

216
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,518
with another man
is just hilarious.

217
00:12:33,603 --> 00:12:35,848
No, no it's not.
I just can't see.

218
00:12:35,872 --> 00:12:38,156
- What? What can't you see?
- Anything.

219
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:42,977
I'm blind.

220
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:54,889
No response to light.

221
00:12:56,493 --> 00:13:01,345
If I remember correctly,
you're a good-looking guy, right?

222
00:13:01,431 --> 00:13:05,666
Just 'cause I'm blind doesn't mean you
can ignore me, you sick twisted bastard!

223
00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:09,987
Playing games with people's
lives, slicing open people's brains.

224
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,108
Mr. Robinson, I'm sorry,

225
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,879
but I believe it's possible the
tumor is infiltrating the optic nerve.

226
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:22,333
We should consider moving the
surgery. Maybe even doing it today.

227
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:28,138
What about you, Dr. Grey?

228
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,341
You're a sexy little thing.

229
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:34,729
Do you think, Dr. Shepherd here
is attractive enough for my wife?

230
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,614
Hmm?

231
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,840
Jennifer, this
isn't easy, I know.

232
00:13:45,942 --> 00:13:49,410
My husband is probably
going to die today.

233
00:13:49,512 --> 00:13:52,263
We're moving up the
surgery, and he might die.

234
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:55,032
And all he can do is try to
fix me up with other men.

235
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:59,486
And I know... I know it's the
tumor talking. But, if he dies,

236
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:03,257
my last memory is going to be
of him calling me a piece of ass.

237
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,465
I'm not involved and
my hopes are not up.

238
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:12,183
Hmm.

239
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,470
I'm having trouble finding a
heartbeat on an ultrasound.

240
00:14:16,572 --> 00:14:19,774
That's what happens, when
you have Scotch for dinner.

241
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:21,943
It's hard to follow the basics.

242
00:14:24,648 --> 00:14:26,931
Oh! Rebecca. Hi.

243
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:30,784
I really didn't want an ultrasound.
I just wanted to get something

244
00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:33,737
for the morning
sickness. It's really bad.

245
00:14:33,823 --> 00:14:37,408
- So you're pregnant?
- Yeah. Just like five weeks
or so.

246
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,278
An ultrasound can be
hard to read this early on,

247
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,197
Let's take a blood sample,
make sure everything's on track.

248
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,385
OK. Dr. Stevens, do you know
when Dr. Karev will be out of surgery?

249
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,438
I just wanted to say hi.

250
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,374
Um, I... I don't know
that he's gone in yet.

251
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,463
You broke up with Meredith Grey?

252
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,599
Doing a trial together, if
that makes you feel better.

253
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,451
I hugged her. Hugged her.

254
00:15:03,553 --> 00:15:07,054
And you're not even together?
What the hell happened?

255
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,158
OK, fine. Tell me
about the clinical trial.

256
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,579
Well, if it doesn't go well,
I'm killing people for sport.

257
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,792
When I walk into
an OR, I'm an expert.

258
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:18,760
I can stop a bleed,
I can remove a clot.

259
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:22,069
I'm the expert. But
in a clinical trial...

260
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,238
I'm experimenting.

261
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,858
Groping around in the dark.
Hoping to do the right thing.

262
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:30,928
She wants greatness from me.

263
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,448
- She's expecting greatness.
- OK, seriously.

264
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,316
Derek, what are you doing?

265
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,153
I'm seeing somebody else.

266
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:45,075
She's lovely.
She's really lovely.

267
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,713
Hey. You came.

268
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:52,466
You have to stop paging
me. Can't deal with this now.

269
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:53,768
I have a big case today...

270
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,037
I'm as scared about
this as you are.

271
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:59,056
I'm not scared. I'm just...

272
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,842
Look, you don't want me, OK?

273
00:16:01,944 --> 00:16:04,895
This is not a thing you want
me for. I won't be good at it.

274
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:08,199
I'm not father material.

275
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,552
You have a husband. He doesn't
have to know that it's mine, OK?

276
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:15,840
No, it's not OK. Alex, I'm just
asking you to get over yourself

277
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:21,778
for one minute and talk to me so
we can figure this thing out. Together.

278
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,799
I have to go.

279
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:33,324
I'll be making the incision
from here to here, and be extra...

280
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:36,227
Excuse me. What you said
about further complications...

281
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:40,014
No, we can't think like that.
There's nothing else wrong with him.

282
00:16:40,116 --> 00:16:44,518
Our intention is to have a healthy baby.
He'll be strong and happy and healthy.

283
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,387
Don't you understand
what we're trying to tell you?

284
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,459
Chances are, your baby's gonna
need a lot more than just heart surgery.

285
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:53,694
- Dr. Karev.
- Chances are, he won't.

286
00:16:53,797 --> 00:16:56,697
Can't cross your fingers
and hope this'll go away.

287
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,749
Dr. Karev.

288
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,502
He's not prepared. I
was trying to prepare him.

289
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,421
They're having a baby. That
baby's gonna be screwed up

290
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,142
'cause he's coming into a world
where his parents are unprepared.

291
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:10,344
They wanna talk
about loving each other,

292
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:14,331
as if that has anything to do with
having the ability to raise a baby.

293
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,551
A sick baby! He's not prepared.
I was trying to prepare him.

294
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:22,373
Karev. Right now, you're feeling
all your feelings right out in the open.

295
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:25,509
Do me a favor and
stuff them back in.

296
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,101
- Interesting advice.
- Don't start with me.

297
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,174
She's no longer
allowed in my apartment.

298
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:43,428
No more tea parties or wine
parties or whatever you two have.

299
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,230
- What are you talking about?
- Hahn. She's unfair.

300
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:49,299
Refuses to teach me. I got in
at Mass Gen, Johns Hopkins.

301
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,203
I could've gotten in anywhere,
and she won't teach me!

302
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:55,206
All right, look. Erica,
she's a really good listener.

303
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:59,193
She comes off harsh at first,
but she's got a really good heart,

304
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,463
so just tell her
how you feel. OK?

305
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:08,268
Tell her how I feel?
Well, I don't speak "Girl."

306
00:18:11,474 --> 00:18:14,474
Sorry about that. I mention
I live with Yang, now?

307
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:20,209
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

308
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:24,535
Callie. Are you speaking
the vagina monologues now?

309
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:28,806
- What?
- I'm all for it, OK?

310
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:31,842
I think it's fantastic. Erica?
I mean, she seems great.

311
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,812
I really do like her,
actually, I do. Are you?

312
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:38,565
You want to know if
Erica and I are a couple?

313
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:41,468
Because I defended her to Yang?

314
00:18:41,571 --> 00:18:44,755
Because you seem like a
couple. A really happy couple.

315
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:49,577
Um... OK, that's...
That's just...

316
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,747
That's insane is what
it is. I'm... I like penis.

317
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:57,134
I mean, I'm a huge,
huge fan of penis.

318
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,253
Hilarious.

319
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:02,506
You've been living in Los
Angeles way too long. Way too long.

320
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:09,780
- George!
- George! George!

321
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,085
Hey! Listen, I am
just the messenger.

322
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:17,137
But you should know that
people are prepared to drop out.

323
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,758
Nobody wants to get drunk
and play darts with their boss.

324
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,345
- Want me to take back
the invitation?
- I'm the messenger.

325
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,837
What's that about? More special
plans with your special friends?

326
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:37,524
I would like us to talk today. I
would like us to talk because

327
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:42,045
I care and I want
to know things,

328
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:45,266
and I have 15 minutes to
hear about your feelings.

329
00:19:45,368 --> 00:19:49,286
So Alex? Alex,
you look thoughtful.

330
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:53,273
I'm very interested to hear... I
mean, what are your thoughts?

331
00:19:56,245 --> 00:19:58,211
Izzie. Your thoughts?
Your feelings?

332
00:19:58,314 --> 00:19:59,864
- Honestly?
- Uh-huh.

333
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:03,017
Little worried about Alex
because his Jane Doe girlfriend

334
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,103
keeps showing up like
something out of<i> Fatal Attraction.</i>

335
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,873
Her name is Rebecca
Pope, she's not my girlfriend.

336
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:12,309
Really? You guys
haven't had sex at all?

337
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:15,846
- Recently?
- She's married. She has a husband.

338
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:20,034
Does it hurt that she's married? I
mean, does that hurt your heart?

339
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,953
- What's the matter with you?
- Trying to talk "Girl."

340
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,706
Well, you coded. Right?

341
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:32,913
What? It's the new slang.
Everybody's saying it.

342
00:20:33,015 --> 00:20:37,100
The way you just said
that? That was you coding.

343
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:42,990
Whatever. Unlike Meredith
with her trials and Petri dishes,

344
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:46,010
and Cristina who has to
practice talking like a human,

345
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:48,762
I actually care
about patient care!

346
00:20:48,865 --> 00:20:51,915
- Need the sparkle pager.
- Not giving you the pager.

347
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:55,001
I can't talk "Girl," and I
shouldn't have to talk "Girl"

348
00:20:55,103 --> 00:20:57,705
because I diagnosed the
patient. I need the pager.

349
00:20:57,807 --> 00:20:59,774
- You can't have it!
- Stop! Stop it!

350
00:20:59,876 --> 00:21:01,608
Give it. Give it to me!

351
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:02,976
Um...

352
00:21:03,078 --> 00:21:06,330
Anyone ever think
you two were a couple?

353
00:21:06,415 --> 00:21:09,016
No, because we screw
boys like whores on tequila.

354
00:21:09,118 --> 00:21:11,163
Then try to marry them
or drown ourselves.

355
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,453
Huh...

356
00:21:13,556 --> 00:21:18,125
You know, make Hahn let me
scrub in, or I'm making you move out.

357
00:21:18,227 --> 00:21:21,128
- What? You...
- Desperate times.

358
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:27,434
Sorry that took so long.
Congratulations, you're pregnant.

359
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:29,353
You're sure?

360
00:21:29,438 --> 00:21:32,005
A big day for pregnant
ladies. Everywhere I turn.

361
00:21:32,108 --> 00:21:34,519
Weird. Only supposed
to give you a couple,

362
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,494
but this is a supply of
vitamins, samples. They're free.

363
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:41,715
No, I... We need to
schedule an abortion.

364
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:47,721
OK. I'm sorry, I...

365
00:21:48,591 --> 00:21:51,592
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

366
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:55,495
I don't mean to intrude, but...

367
00:21:55,597 --> 00:22:00,067
You might want to sit with this for a
few days before you make your decision.

368
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:02,102
There's no decision to make.

369
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:07,841
I'm HIV-positive. And
the condom broke.

370
00:22:07,944 --> 00:22:12,379
I got tested already, and
I will, again, in six months,

371
00:22:12,481 --> 00:22:14,948
but so far I'm fine.

372
00:22:16,953 --> 00:22:20,537
Please, I just... I want
to get this over with.

373
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,840
Is there any chance that
we can take care of it today?

374
00:22:25,194 --> 00:22:28,045
Yeah. Let me see
what I can set up.

375
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:29,930
Thank you.

376
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:40,140
<i>Nurse Santos to Geriatrics.
Nurse Santos to Geriatrics.</i>

377
00:22:40,242 --> 00:22:41,553
- Here.
- All right.

378
00:22:41,577 --> 00:22:43,644
- Torres.
- Hey.

379
00:22:43,746 --> 00:22:47,465
Do me a favor and put
Yang on your surgery.

380
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:51,519
- Only if you buy drinks
at Joe's.
- Done.

381
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:08,046
Dr. Montgomery?

382
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,236
Do me a favor? Can
you talk to my patient?

383
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:11,689
Don't work here, anymore.

384
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,925
She's pregnant and HIV-positive.
Thinks she has to terminate.

385
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:17,261
- She doesn't.
- I know, but she doesn't.

386
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:21,515
- It's not my area of expertise.
- I don't work here anymore,
Stevens.

387
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:24,784
If I worked here, I'd be
performing surgery after surgery.

388
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:28,555
I might even be back with my husband,
who's, apparently, on the market.

389
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:31,992
I'm not saying that I want
to get back with my husband.

390
00:23:32,094 --> 00:23:34,411
It's just that things
were simpler with him

391
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:37,564
than the messy, messy
single life I am currently living.

392
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,633
Which was not my
point, by the way.

393
00:23:39,735 --> 00:23:42,152
My point was... that I
no longer work here.

394
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,855
Which means, you need to pull
your face out of the potato chip trough,

395
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,442
- and tend your patients
yourself.
- I know, but...

396
00:23:48,544 --> 00:23:50,944
You're a fighter. What happened?

397
00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:52,846
I lost a lot of fights.

398
00:23:52,948 --> 00:23:56,533
Well, time to get back up. Go.

399
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,304
Be the change you
want to see in the world.

400
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,326
You just quote Gandhi to me?

401
00:24:05,428 --> 00:24:08,445
So... Time to
take her to the OR.

402
00:24:09,431 --> 00:24:13,099
I'm not an idiot. We heard you.

403
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,836
It could be bad.

404
00:24:15,938 --> 00:24:19,189
There's always a whole lot of
bad to focus on if you want to.

405
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,976
But there's hope too, right?

406
00:24:23,078 --> 00:24:26,480
There's always hope too.

407
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:34,154
- Jennifer?
- No, it's Dr. Shepherd.

408
00:24:34,256 --> 00:24:38,008
I hate this. Not
being able to see.

409
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,094
I just want to see Jennifer.

410
00:24:40,196 --> 00:24:44,231
Phillip, this is an
extremely risky operation.

411
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:48,084
You may have a few weeks to live.
Could spend that time with Jennifer.

412
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,722
You don't have to
do this surgery today.

413
00:24:53,175 --> 00:24:58,562
I'm trying to fix Jennifer up. I
don't want to leave her alone.

414
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:03,934
That's the one thing about
all of this I really can't stand.

415
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:08,054
I just want her to be
all right when I'm gone.

416
00:25:08,157 --> 00:25:11,842
You need to tell her that.
Before you go into surgery,

417
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:17,414
you need to remember this conversation,
and you need to tell her that.

418
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:26,173
Hey. I only have five minutes
because we moved the surgery up.

419
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,809
But I did want to come
and say that, obviously,

420
00:25:28,911 --> 00:25:32,179
he doesn't know me at all. I'm
not the one emotionally involved.

421
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:35,515
- He's the one
emotionally involved.
- He?

422
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,585
Derek told me not
to get my hopes up.

423
00:25:38,688 --> 00:25:42,155
Anybody who knows me knows
I'm not a hopeful person to begin with.

424
00:25:42,257 --> 00:25:43,556
Right.

425
00:25:43,658 --> 00:25:45,943
I came up with this
clinical trial. It's my baby.

426
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:48,945
Does he honestly think
that I've walked into this with

427
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:52,999
no understanding of how hard it'll be?
Seriously, no wonder we didn't work out.

428
00:25:53,101 --> 00:25:55,869
Because he told you
not to get your hopes up?

429
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,589
Exactly. I gotta go.
Surgery's about to start.

430
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:02,576
- The surgery with no hope?
- Shut up.

431
00:26:04,847 --> 00:26:08,748
So who's the new mystery
woman that Derek's dating?

432
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:14,054
Who's the unlucky McRebound?

433
00:26:15,257 --> 00:26:17,891
What? Oh, is the whole
"Mc" thing over now?

434
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,394
Surely things haven't
changed that much here?

435
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:23,597
Addison. The woman standing
immediately to your right,

436
00:26:23,699 --> 00:26:27,201
the one handing you
the surgical instruments...

437
00:26:29,371 --> 00:26:31,254
- Hey.
- Hey.

438
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:36,593
Six dates, heavy petting, lots
of tongue. Good guy. Scalpel?

439
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:43,783
We can have the baby? You're
saying we can have the baby.

440
00:26:43,885 --> 00:26:46,870
- A healthy baby?
- With proper
prenatal treatment,

441
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:49,639
the risks to your baby
are substantially reduced.

442
00:26:49,725 --> 00:26:53,460
Haven't found you an OB, I think
the process might prove difficult...

443
00:26:53,562 --> 00:26:57,180
Doesn't matter. We'll figure it
out. We can figure anything out.

444
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,215
I can't believe this! Thank you!

445
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:03,053
No! No. Do not thank her.

446
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:07,557
I asked you to do one thing, I
asked you to schedule an abortion.

447
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,293
- Sarah.
- No.

448
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:13,029
She just walks in here and gets
your hopes up, and that's not OK!

449
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,616
I was diagnosed at 19. And I
have learned how to deal with it.

450
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:22,889
But I will not put that onto a baby! I
cannot bring a baby into this world

451
00:27:22,991 --> 00:27:26,059
who could possibly
have this disease. I won't!

452
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:30,464
Now, could you please
just schedule the abortion?

453
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:35,302
And, do me a favor, don't come
back! I'd like a different doctor.

454
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:59,226
Phillip, remember
what we talked about?

455
00:28:01,397 --> 00:28:05,732
Jennifer? Jen? Jennifer!

456
00:28:10,906 --> 00:28:14,675
I don't want to leave you alone.
I want you to meet someone.

457
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:18,345
I want you to
promise me you'll try.

458
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:23,817
Because I can't do this thinking
I'm leaving you alone. OK?

459
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:30,306
OK. OK.

460
00:28:31,927 --> 00:28:35,629
Maybe I'll make
it. I hope I make it.

461
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:49,493
<i>♪ Don't you wish you were? ♪</i>

462
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:53,731

465
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:07,310
Go ahead. A little bit
further. Good, keep him flat.

466
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,201
OK. Got him, Karev?

467
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:18,539
Placenta looks good.

468
00:29:18,641 --> 00:29:20,857
- You OK to close, Dr. Bailey?
- Yep.

469
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,160
Membrane's intact.

470
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:27,063
Oh, no. She's hemorrhaging.

471
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:31,150
This blood is moving a little too
fast. I need another set of hands here!

472
00:29:32,987 --> 00:29:35,806
Her uterus isn't
contracting. Damn it.

473
00:29:49,838 --> 00:29:51,054
Where's Montgomery?

474
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:53,523
The mom is in distress.
They're trying to close.

475
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,676
Get the baby to Hahn.
Addie knows what she's doing.

476
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:00,880
I think I've been
hiding in the clinic.

477
00:30:00,982 --> 00:30:02,649
Yeah? OK, listen, Izzie?

478
00:30:02,751 --> 00:30:04,968
I lost the contest. I
couldn't hack cardio.

479
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,120
- I performed CPR on a deer.
- Izzie!

480
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,190
- I think I've been hiding.
- You can't play darts with us.

481
00:30:10,292 --> 00:30:12,192
- What?
- I shouldn't have to say this.

482
00:30:12,294 --> 00:30:14,077
- You should get this.
- Get what?

483
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:18,915
You're not an intern anymore.
I'm not a resident. And, that sucks,

484
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,029
but I'm trying to
make the best of it.

485
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:24,554
Trying to stop complaining

who don't want to get drunk

487
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,354

488
00:30:29,378 --> 00:30:32,845
- I'm their boss.
- Yes. Yeah. You're their boss.

489
00:30:32,947 --> 00:30:35,732
You're in charge. And
you should get that.

490
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:38,652
I gotta do something.

491
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:43,874
Get in here.

492
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:46,454
I thought I made myself clear.

493
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:49,796
You did. I didn't. Get in here!

494
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,018
- Listen and learn.
- I knew it. You disapprove.

495
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,587
You're here to push
some kind of agenda, right?

496
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,973
No. No.

497
00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:02,993
Listen, if you wanna have an
abortion because you want to,

498
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:05,829
that's between you and
whatever god you believe in.

499
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:07,709
But if you wanna
have an abortion

500
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:10,600
'cause you think that's
what medicine is telling you,

501
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:14,671
that's between you and me. I
was ineffectual. I was unclear.

502
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:18,508
I've been on my heels a little
bit lately, and I was unclear.

503
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:20,344
So just listen, OK?

504
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:24,314
I wasn't telling you there is some
chance your baby might not be born sick.

505
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:28,685
I was telling you there is a
98 percent chance your baby

506
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:32,104
could be born perfectly
healthy. A 98 percent chance.

507
00:31:32,207 --> 00:31:35,258
There's a higher chance of
being born with Down Syndrome

508
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,161
than there is of you
passing HIV on to your child.

509
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:40,647
I don't... I just... I can't...

510
00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:43,115
I know you gave up about
having children a long time ago,

511
00:31:43,218 --> 00:31:48,388
and I understand that it's difficult
to readjust your thinking so quickly,

512
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,624
but if you take your
meds responsibly,

513
00:31:50,726 --> 00:31:54,377
there's no reason why you can't
have a beautiful, healthy baby.

514
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:58,665
This is your chance.
If you want it.

515
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:01,434
This is your chance to be a mom.

516
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:08,225
- A 98 percent chance?
- Ninety-eight percent chance.

517
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,221
Thank you.

518
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,529

I can feel it getting stronger.

525
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:58,608
