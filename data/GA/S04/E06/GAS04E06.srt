1
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,613
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:06,088
<i>Pick me. Choose me. Love me.</i>

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,674
I need to not die emotionally
crippled and alone.

4
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:11,960
Callie. What I did to
you? It's unforgivable.

5
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:14,012
- So you two are together?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:16,781
Know what? You're
inappropriate and unprofessional.

7
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:19,834
Dr. Hahn agreed to become our
head of cardiothoracic surgery.

8
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:23,522
- Looking forward to it,
Dr. Yang.
- My wife has filed for divorce.

9
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:26,258
Don't know if I can handle
one more night in that hotel.

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,575
You can say anything to me.

11
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:30,412
I want to marry you.
And you're not ready.

12
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:37,236
<i>There's this thing
about being a surgeon.</i>

13
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:40,772
<i>Maybe it's pride or maybe
it's just about being tough.</i>

14
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:45,244
<i>But a true surgeon never admits they
need help unless absolutely necessary.</i>

15
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:47,545
What are your other symptoms?

16
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,497
There's the father thing.

17
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:54,035
The mother thing.
The sister thing.

18
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,338
The dying and coming
back to life thing.

19
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,889
You have too many things.

20
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:01,543
I can't sleep. I can't sleep
without the dreaming.

21
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:02,722
And the panic attacks.

22
00:01:02,746 --> 00:01:04,579
- One panic attack.
- OK, still...

23
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:07,315
- What's wrong with me?
- As far as I can tell,

24
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:09,668
severe abandonment issues.

25
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:15,073
That's crap. Psych is crap.

26
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,142
- Issues?
- I mean, it's in the book.

27
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,511
The book said it, not me.

28
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:25,400
Have you considered, maybe you and
Derek should... stop having breakup sex?

29
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,888
OK.

30
00:01:33,644 --> 00:01:40,348
The more available he
gets, the more I pull away.

31
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,369
- What do you mean?
- Nothing. It's a Derek thing.

32
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:48,924
<i>Surgeons don't need to ask for help
because they're tougher than that.</i>

33
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:52,994
<i>Surgeons are cowboys.
Rough around the edges.</i>

34
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:55,029
<i>Hardcore.</i>

35
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:57,983
<i>At least, that's what
they want you to think.</i>

36
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,970
Ah. Good morning.

37
00:02:02,072 --> 00:02:05,507
Oh, perfect timing.
Trout for breakfast.

38
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:08,510
- Mm-hmm.
- Again.

39
00:02:11,148 --> 00:02:13,381
Yeah, don't start. I
let you live on my land.

40
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:15,283
- Don't start.
- I'm older than you.

41
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:17,130
I've seen life from
both sides now.

42
00:02:17,154 --> 00:02:18,820
Are you going to start singing?

43
00:02:18,923 --> 00:02:23,041
I'm just saying that a man who is
up fishing at 3:00 every morning

44
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,511
- is a man in pain over a woman.
- Oh, good,
a country western song.

45
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:30,282
I'm pointing out it's a thing
we have in common, Derek.

46
00:02:32,502 --> 00:02:36,404
You know, what we need is something
to take our mind off of everything.

47
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:39,674
What we need...

48
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:43,077
- is a gentlemen's evening.
- A what?

49
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:46,448
A good, old-fashioned,
gentlemen's evening.

50
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,216
Tonight.

51
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,202
Yeah.

52
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,892
This is absurd.

53
00:03:02,398 --> 00:03:03,665
Hey.

54
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:07,502
You shouldn't be sleeping
in the on call room.

55
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:12,257
It's not always on call.
Sometimes it's the gurney in the...

56
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,460
- tunnels and the...
- It's absurd.

57
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,829
When I have a
perfectly good bed.

58
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,749
And I know that we said we
would wait and be respectful.

59
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:23,751
And we have been.
Very respectful.

60
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:26,337
But now I want sex.

61
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,558
- Right now?
- No. Tonight.

62
00:03:30,894 --> 00:03:36,397
Tonight we will
have hot, perfect sex.

63
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:41,320
- You in?
- Yeah. I'm obviously in.

64
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:45,457
I got to go. I got patients to
check on. Erica Hahn to impress.

65
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,960
I'm going to go kick some cardio
ass. Oh, God. I got to shave my legs.

66
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,447
It's OK if you don't have a
chance to shave your legs.

67
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:56,217
No, it's not. It is not OK,
George. I have to shave my legs.

68
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,619
I will be shaving my legs.

69
00:03:57,721 --> 00:04:01,623
- Hot, perfect sex
requires shaved legs.
- OK.

70
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:05,727
<i>- Dr. Steinberg, 1478.
- Erica Hahn! First day!</i>

71
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:09,397
First day, indeed. And a
mountain of paperwork to prove it.

72
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:13,051
- Derek Shepherd. You know Erica Hahn.
- You're the new Burke.

73
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:16,437
And this is Dr. Mark Sloan,
head of plastics. Erica Hahn.

74
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:20,642
- Oh, the new Burke.
- Welcome. Excuse us.

75
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:23,245
Interesting guys.

76
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:27,265
And by interesting, I
mean ridiculously attractive.

77
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:31,469
Do you hire on looks alone
or is actual skill a factor?

78
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,705
- Good to have you here, Erica.
- Good to be here, Richard.

79
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:38,126
- What exactly is
a gentlemen's evening?
- I don't know. It's an evening.

80
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:40,028
- With gentlemen.
- And strippers?

81
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,063
I don't think the
Chief meant strippers.

82
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:44,633
Sure sounds like
strippers. Dr. Bailey.

83
00:04:44,735 --> 00:04:48,569
What's the first thing that comes to
mind when I say "Gentlemen's evening?"

84
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:53,541
Tassels. Shiny sequined
tassels and one dollar bills.

85
00:04:53,643 --> 00:04:54,923
See? Strippers.

86
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:56,995
There will be no
strippers. Almost positive.

87
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:59,230
- You don't know what this is?
- No. But you're in.

88
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,901
- Why not? I like
to be surprised.
- OK.

89
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,553
Oh, heads up.
Mr. Incredible, twelve o'clock.

90
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:08,923
- Hi.
- Hi.

91
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,821
What the hell was that about?

92
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:15,580
That was about a date we have
later in the on call room. It's nothing.

93
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,227
Sure seem to be losing sleep
over a whole lot of nothing.

94
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:22,570
This is it. Hahn is in the hospital.
Freaking Izzie is on her service again.

95
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:24,973
I got to ride this trauma
train back into cardio.

96
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,042
- OK. What do we got?
- Two ambulances,
multiple traumas.

97
00:05:28,145 --> 00:05:30,112
Any chance you
need a resident's help?

98
00:05:30,214 --> 00:05:34,515
As long as you want to smash
bones. Into dust. While people cry.

99
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:40,271
- Sweet. What do you got?
- Chest pain. Tamponade. Ruptured aorta.

100
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:43,458
More like a clown car.
Jackie Escott, 25 years old,

101
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,461
dislocated shoulder, lac to
her thigh. Vital signs are stable.

102
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:49,881
And, Helena Boyd, 26
years old, also stable.

103
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,984
Obvious nasal fracture, facial
lacs and a chunk of missing scalp.

104
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,654
- She ripped out my hair!
- She ripped my shoulder!

105
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:58,256
You ripped out your own
shoulder trying to push me!

106
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,558
Who let go? Did anybody
let go of the dress?

107
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,794
Hang in there. Don't
let her psych you out.

108
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:06,414
- OK, what the hell's all this?
- It's a store contest. I'm the judge.

109
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:08,766
- Last to let go...
- Wins the wedding of my dreams!

110
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,702
- Of my dreams!
- All right, enough!

111
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:13,738
You two are injured. You need
to get your priorities straight

112
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,160
and let go of the... Let go... Let
go of the dress so we can treat you!

113
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,529
All right, let go now. Now.

114
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:25,249
Yeah. That's not
going to happen.

115
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,552
All right. Fine. Let's move.

116
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:36,161
Oh, please let this be something
good. Something cardio good. Please.

117
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:39,798
Thirty-three-year-old male,
discovered unconscious but stable,

118
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,801
- survived a 12,000-foot
free fall.
- A what?

119
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,235
His parachute didn't open.

120
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,404
He fell 12,000 feet
without a parachute?

121
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,174
Thank you.

122
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,215
- What's his name?
- Rick. I'm Rick Jacobs. Ow!

123
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:59,851
- He's talking?
- You'd think after 12,000 feet,

124
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:02,866
- he'd have at least
a punctured lung.
- Rick? Where are you?

125
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,157
My God! There you are! How is
he? How is he? Is he OK? Is he dying?

126
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,259
I'm not dying, Sally.

127
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,056
- OK, ma'am. You need to calm down.
- Is this your wife?

128
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,498
- My skydiving instructor.
- OK, ma'am.

129
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,551
I watched the whole
thing. I couldn't do anything.

130
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:20,355
I was just... I was just in the
clouds, floating, watching while he...

131
00:07:20,457 --> 00:07:24,375
while he... You fell to your
death! His chute didn't open!

132
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,111
We need to do our jobs,
and you're making that difficult

133
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:31,699
by hovering over the patient. Look,
please. Have a seat and breathe.

134
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:35,670
I heard we have a
skydiver who fell 12,000 feet.

135
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:37,772
That'd be me.

136
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:42,110
- Uh... Hello.
- Hey.

137
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,581
- He's talking?
- It's... Clearly he's in shock.

138
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:48,850
Can't feel the
extent of his injuries.

139
00:07:48,952 --> 00:07:52,437
- Let's get him down for a CT.
- Cristina, where are you going?

140
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,023
Multiple injuries means
multiple surgeries.

141
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,974
I'm going to get me some cardio.

142
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,927
OK, do you see that you're
bleeding all over the dress?

143
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:02,063
- It's not about the dress.
- I can't...

144
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:04,799
I can't... Look, there's
too much blood down here.

145
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:08,414
- Which one of your legs is bleeding?
- I don't know. I can't feel anything.

146
00:08:08,438 --> 00:08:10,038
Have a broken nose down here?

147
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:12,406
- What's with the dress?
- It's not about the dress.

148
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:15,046
- Can't they just
split the prize?
- I offered.

149
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:20,298
- I offered that 14 hours ago.
- It is $100,000 wedding
package,

150
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
and I am not splitting
it with anyone.

151
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,137
- Oh, you're bleeding
on your dress.
- It's not about the dress!

152
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,557
- I have to stabilize
that shoulder.
- I'll go grab a sling.

153
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:31,525
- Well, this is cozy.
- This is hell.

154
00:08:31,627 --> 00:08:35,379
I assigned O'Malley to you to keep him
away. Now our patients are connected.

155
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,448
Not looking at this
like the opportunity it is.

156
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,517
- Meaning?
- Meaning he's an intern.

157
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:42,570
It's like, half my
job, torturing interns.

158
00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:45,056
Thanks. That's almost
sweet, but torturing George

159
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,398
is not going to
make this any better.

160
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,197
Torture him how, exactly?

161
00:08:55,685 --> 00:09:00,521
My hands always get so sweaty
in hospitals. It's the weirdest thing.

162
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,591
It's pretty common, actually.

163
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:07,546
Makes you feel any better, Dr. Hahn
has done this procedure hundreds of times.

164
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:12,400
She's really going to thread a catheter
up my leg? All the way to my heart?

165
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:15,136
Trust me. You are
in excellent hands.

166
00:09:15,238 --> 00:09:17,872
But I'll be out, right?

167
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,142
Oh, yeah. You'll be asleep.
You won't remember a thing.

168
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,078
Ivory-billed woodpecker.

169
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,432
- I'm sorry?
- Ivory-billed woodpecker.

170
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:30,218
That's what's getting
me through this.

171
00:09:31,288 --> 00:09:34,672
I'm a lifelong birdwatcher.

172
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,574
And when I get through this,

173
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:40,511
I am finally going to scout
the ivory-billed woodpecker.

174
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:46,818
It is so rare. You know,
we thought it was extinct.

175
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,874
But it's not. It
lives in Arkansas.

176
00:09:52,976 --> 00:09:56,644
In this one little
patch of swamp.

177
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:03,751
Do you have any idea how incredible
it is to see a bird like that in person?

178
00:10:07,957 --> 00:10:11,209
I'm sorry. I'll be
just one second.

179
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,413
- Why are you hovering?
- Guess what came into the pit?

180
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:18,216
No, no. Don't guess,
I'll tell you. Skydiver.

181
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:21,152
Skydiver whose chute didn't
open who fell 12,000 feet

182
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,687
and landed in some shrubbery.

183
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:26,390
Wow. Poor guy. He probably
broke every bone in his body.

184
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:30,394
No, the point is not poor guy.
The point is amazing surgery.

185
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,263
And it can be yours.

186
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:37,468
For the low, low price of... a
humdrum, everyday, cardiac cath.

187
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,154
Yeah, forget it. I'm not
giving up Hahn's service.

188
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:42,507
Hey. Izzie, you know
what? Cardio is my thing.

189
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:46,527
No. I like this
patient. I like Hahn.

190
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:50,649
- And I like cardio.
- You know,
you're flirting with cardio.

191
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:54,802
I am married to cardio. You
will marry general surgery.

192
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,238
Or, you know...
OK, perhaps neuro.

193
00:10:58,841 --> 00:11:03,594
But you? You are nowhere near
hardcore enough to commit to cardio.

194
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:08,099
So you are telling me to
stop flirting with your husband?

195
00:11:08,184 --> 00:11:10,251
I get it. That's cute.

196
00:11:10,353 --> 00:11:12,313
If you're going to
ask me for a favor,

197
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:15,005
insulting my personal
life is not a great tactic.

198
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,824
I am not talking
about your sex life.

199
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,426
I could not care less about
your sex life. It's a skydiver.

200
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:23,147
- Izzie, skydiver.
- Oh, yeah. It sounds cool. Enjoy it.

201
00:11:24,534 --> 00:11:27,152
If his intestines look
like I think they will,

202
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:30,054
- that's first priority.
- Could have delayed paralysis.

203
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,223
This is not a
contest, gentlemen.

204
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,409
But since a perfed
bowel could kill the guy,

205
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,861
whether or not his
spine's in working order,

206
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:38,683
my money's on
the Chief going first.

207
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:42,567
Hey. What did I miss? Any cardiothoracic
concerns? I'd be happy to page Dr. Hahn.

208
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:46,354
- Scans coming up.
- Here it is. Wait for it.

209
00:11:47,157 --> 00:11:48,522
Wait.

210
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,438
- Wait.
- Well, that can't
be right, can it?

211
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:56,947
I'm not seeing any free fluid,
any intraperitoneal gases.

212
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,385
- Does anybody see anything?
- There! Right there. A hematoma.

213
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,604
- The right lower quadrant.
- It's the appendix.

214
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:07,792
We're saying this
guy fell 12,000 feet

215
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:11,128
and, basically, all he
needs is an appendectomy?

216
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,859
You're charting. In a closet.

217
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:27,678
I get a lot of work done
in here. It's quiet and nice.

218
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,047
And a closet.

219
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,816
Look.

220
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:35,336
When I'm out there, roaming
the floors, I'm the "Other Grey"

221
00:12:35,438 --> 00:12:38,689
that Dr. Yang likes to
humiliate and kick around.

222
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,493
And in here, I'm not.
You know, in here, I'm...

223
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:48,499
It's just... It's my place,
OK? It's... It's a closet.

224
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,619
You know, every intern
class has its runt of the litter.

225
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:56,057
Keep this up, this year
it's going to be you. Get up.

226
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,759
Oh, sorry. You probably
need to get in here.

227
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:01,128
No, grab a sling from
the box and come with me.

228
00:13:01,231 --> 00:13:02,680
With you?

229
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,084
If you'd rather sit like a loser in
a closet doing charts, you can.

230
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:09,520
Or you can come help me
on ortho today. Your choice.

231
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,773
No way. No fricking way!

232
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,715
It's the only solution if neither
of you let go of the dress.

233
00:13:15,812 --> 00:13:19,347
It's very simple. Dr. Torres needs
to treat Jackie's shoulder and leg.

234
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:21,715
So, Jackie, you need a proxy.

235
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:23,337
- What?
- Think about it, babe.

236
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,568
Gives you an advantage.

237
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,955
You get to rest your hand
and come back refreshed.

238
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:30,457
- Give me the dress. I'll be the proxy.
- No way. This isn't fair.

239
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,213
- You think this is fair?
- Dr. O'Malley's the proxy.

240
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:38,899
- What?
- He'll hold onto the dress.

241
00:13:40,636 --> 00:13:43,504
Hold the dress.
You just want me to...

242
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:45,756
stand here and hold a dress?

243
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:49,343
No one ever said
internship was easy.

244
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,522
Dude, your job
kind of sucks, huh?

245
00:14:01,624 --> 00:14:05,359
Hello! Watch the shoulder!

246
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:08,296
Oh, check it out.
Bambi's a bridesmaid.

247
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:11,883
You're right. This
did cheer me up.

248
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:18,439
You've got no lung injuries, no
spinal injuries, no broken bones.

249
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,758
- You're just a lucky man.
- Holy crap.

250
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,911
The only thing we found was a
little bleeding in your lower abdomen.

251
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:25,913
We have to remove your appendix.

252
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:29,783
- How is that even possible?
- The body's an amazing thing.

253
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:33,220
You know, sometimes these
things... They just happen.

254
00:14:36,326 --> 00:14:38,926
If you had died... God.

255
00:14:39,028 --> 00:14:44,649
I didn't though. I lived. This
is the most amazing feeling.

256
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:47,001
I feel like I could do
anything right now.

257
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:48,581
I mean, anything in the world.

258
00:14:48,605 --> 00:14:52,874
Because I faced
death and I... I survived.

259
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,693
- It changes a person.
- It does.

260
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,079
It so does.

261
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,417
Sally. Sal. I have to...

262
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,359
- I want to...
- Don't worry.

263
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:09,040
The minute... The minute we get
out of here, I'm destroying that video.

264
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:12,076
You will never have
to re-live that horrible...

265
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:13,923
In fact, where's your helmet?

266
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:16,564
I'm going to destroy
that video right now.

267
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,599
Sally. Sal.

268
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:21,469
- Wait!
- Did she say video?

269
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:26,373
Now, the trick is to envision
the artery like a spaghetti noodle.

270
00:15:26,475 --> 00:15:29,143
- Pliable, but not too fragile.
- Good morning.

271
00:15:29,245 --> 00:15:30,645
Morning, Chief.

272
00:15:30,747 --> 00:15:33,915
Oh, this is an unexpected
surprise, Chief. You need something?

273
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:37,117
First day. Just wanted to
see how you were settling in.

274
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,853
You see that?

275
00:15:38,955 --> 00:15:43,341
It's a blockage. The left main
coronary artery. It's totally closed off.

276
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:47,628
There's no way I'm getting a stent in
there. We're gonna have to open him up.

277
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,614
BP's dropping to 58 over 20.

278
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:53,467
- Oh, his heart's racing.
- His temp's rising. Muscles are rigid.

279
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:57,371
Let's bring him off anesthesia
and start him on a 100 percent O2.

280
00:15:57,473 --> 00:15:59,607
He's got malignant hyperthermia.

281
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,442
He's allergic to the anesthesia?

282
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:05,163
- He'll never be able
to endure CABG.
- So what are our options?

283
00:16:10,786 --> 00:16:12,820
That's just...

284
00:16:12,922 --> 00:16:16,790
I mean, it sounds
like you're telling me...

285
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:23,947
You're not actually telling
me I'm... I'm going to die?

286
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,402
The blockage we found in your
heart needs surgery. Extensive surgery.

287
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:34,174
Angioplasty won't work. And since
you're allergic to the anesthesia...

288
00:16:34,978 --> 00:16:38,312
So I'll just...

289
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:41,966
I'll be like this.

290
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:47,271
I'll be sick and exhausted...

291
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,441
and like this...

292
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:56,764
until one day
when I'll just... die.

293
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:05,939
It would have been wonderful.

294
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:09,093
To see that bird.

295
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,014
It would have been wonderful.

296
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,971
You're crowding me, O'Malley.

297
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,628
Hey! I think he just let go! You
just let go of the dress, didn't you?

298
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,797
- No.
- I wish to God he had.

299
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:32,716
I swear, if you let go
and lose this contest

300
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:36,286
after my Jackie
almost died to win it...

301
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,556
Dude. A busted shoulder
does not mean she almost died.

302
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:42,859
- OK?
- Whatever. I'm watching you.

303
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,331
I know you all
think this is stupid.

304
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:50,534
If I were you, I would
think this is really stupid.

305
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:53,704
Well, I've never been married
myself, so I'm not one to judge.

306
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:57,808
But George here knows all about
what it takes, don't you, O'Malley?

307
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,127
You're married? For how long?

308
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:05,666
- Not very long.
- Newlyweds? Congratulations!

309
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,302
Thanks.

310
00:18:08,404 --> 00:18:13,774
Now Jackie? Dr. Karev and I are
going to do this on the count of three, OK?

311
00:18:13,877 --> 00:18:17,712
I should totally win over that Helena
girl. I'm way more injured than she is.

312
00:18:17,814 --> 00:18:21,916
- I should just win by default.
- One... two...

313
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:24,318
Three.

314
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,937
Ow!

315
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,438
Is it in?

316
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,041
Ow!

317
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,594
- Ooh. Popped back out.
- She's gonna need surgery.

318
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:37,114
Whoa! Hey! No. I got
to get back to my dress.

319
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,733
Just wrap bandages around it!

320
00:18:38,835 --> 00:18:41,986
You would rather hold on to a
dress with a dislocated shoulder

321
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:45,506
- than let me repair it
in surgery now?
- I can have surgery anytime.

322
00:18:45,608 --> 00:18:47,974
I can only win
this wedding once.

323
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,724
So what, he just... stands
there and holds a dress?

324
00:19:03,826 --> 00:19:06,393
I know. I thought it was
going to be more exciting, too.

325
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:09,496
- A monkey could hold a dress.
- Actually,

326
00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:13,000
- it's a lot harder
than it looks.
- Don't let them get to you.

327
00:19:13,102 --> 00:19:16,369
Tune them out. All of them.
It's the only way to get through it.

328
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:19,073
Sweetie, he's your
competition. Don't help him.

329
00:19:19,174 --> 00:19:21,775
You ever give morphine to
people who aren't patients?

330
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:24,178
- This kind of blows.
- It's more fun when you heckle.

331
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,531
- Don't heckle George.
- Whatever. I got something way better.

332
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,567
Something that tops
O'Malley playing bride?

333
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,238
Skydiver video.

334
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,616
- What are we doing?
- Video.

335
00:19:41,698 --> 00:19:44,098
From the helmet of a
skydiver without a chute.

336
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,216
You guys are sick.

337
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,701
It's not a snuff film.
The guy survives.

338
00:19:48,371 --> 00:19:50,087
Holy...

339
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,907
- Wow.
- Oh! Is he...? Oh, no.

340
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:55,426
He's going for the chute.
And it doesn't open!

341
00:19:55,511 --> 00:19:57,678
- He's flailing.
- Going for his second chute!

342
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,597
- Oh, jeez.
- Also doesn't open!

343
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,683
- Think there'd be
more screaming.
- Look how close the ground is.

344
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,665
- What's he doing?
- Peeing his pants?

345
00:20:04,721 --> 00:20:06,765
Is he saying
something? Turn it up.

346
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:10,858
<i>Oh, God! I wish I would've
told you. I'm so in love with you.</i>

347
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,877
I love you! I love you,
Sally! I love you! I...

348
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,863
Oh!

349
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,683
Who's Sally?

350
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:23,303
- His skydiving instructor.
- Sad.

351
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,839
What are you doing here?
You supposed to be in surgery?

352
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:29,543
My guy is allergic to anesthesia.
The surgery was canceled.

353
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:36,200
I drowned. I was sinking.

354
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:38,953
I died.

355
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:42,334
And you know what I realized?

356
00:20:42,358 --> 00:20:46,009
I realized how stupid
all of my issues are.

357
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,646
I'm waiting for how
this applies to me.

358
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:51,464
- It doesn't.
- Of course not.

359
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:53,784
Well, that man fell,

360
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:57,988
and all he wanted was one last
chance to tell Sally how he felt about her.

361
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,658
And I got one last chance.

362
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,794
I got my chance, and
what have I done with it?

363
00:21:04,747 --> 00:21:06,446
You know, being
aware of your crap

364
00:21:06,548 --> 00:21:10,233
and actually overcoming your
crap are two very different things.

365
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,623
- I know.
- Ha! OK, I found it.

366
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:21,562
I know how you
can do the surgery.

367
00:21:21,664 --> 00:21:23,931
On the patient who is
allergic to anesthesia.

368
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,044
Well, no anesthesia
means no ventilator.

369
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:29,403
No ventilator means no CABG.
Not a whole lot of wiggle room there.

370
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:31,305
- Operate while he's awake.
- Yang.

371
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:34,375
Use a high thoracic epidural to
numb him from the chest down.

372
00:21:34,477 --> 00:21:36,894
Let him breathe on
his own the entire time.

373
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:39,596
They pulled it off in India
last month. And again...

374
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:43,501
Dr. Hahn, you wanted to sign the
discharge papers for Mr. Arnold?

375
00:21:43,586 --> 00:21:46,954
Not quite yet.

376
00:21:48,591 --> 00:21:53,093
Wide awake? You
want me to let you

377
00:21:53,195 --> 00:21:56,847
slice open my chest
while I'm wide awake?

378
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:58,982
It is your best option.

379
00:22:00,469 --> 00:22:03,103
Uh... How...

380
00:22:03,205 --> 00:22:06,640
How long would I
have to be lying there...

381
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:10,511
on the table, with my
chest open like that?

382
00:22:10,613 --> 00:22:14,865
The surgery can take up to
five or six hours, maybe more.

383
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:21,855
Six hours. Awake. With
you operating on my heart. I...

384
00:22:21,957 --> 00:22:24,341
The ivory-billed woodpecker.

385
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:25,954
- What?
- What?

386
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:28,896
The ivory-billed
woodpecker, Mr. Arnold.

387
00:22:28,998 --> 00:22:32,333
You want to live to see it, don't
you? This is your only chance.

388
00:22:36,138 --> 00:22:38,439
Ivory-billed woodpecker.

389
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:44,361
Excellent. Stevens, we will
scrub in as soon as an OR is free.

390
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,823
But the surgery
was Cristina's idea.

391
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,299
Either you want in or
you don't. Which is it?

392
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:51,235
- I do.
- But...

393
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:55,439
I'm sure there'll be standing room in
the gallery, Yang. Stevens, book the OR.

394
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:08,202
- Chief.
- Awake open heart surgery?

395
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,098
I wanna talk to
you about tonight.

396
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,206
You heard about
this awake surgery?

397
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:16,843
I invited Sloan and, well, I'm
wondering what I should tell him to expect.

398
00:23:16,945 --> 00:23:20,731
- Tell him to expect
a good time.
- OK. So what is that?

399
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:24,718
Poker? Cigars? Whiskey?
I mean, what kind of things?

400
00:23:26,388 --> 00:23:30,324
A good time, Shep. You know?

401
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:35,279
You have no idea the
kind of stamina it takes

402
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:39,015
to stand in a display
window for two days.

403
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:43,153
It's the hardest thing
I've ever done. Like, ever.

404
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:48,459
You're risking permanent damage
to your shoulder over a contest.

405
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,527
What does your dress look like?

406
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:54,215
Strapless, sweetheart neckline.

407
00:23:54,317 --> 00:23:56,850
Crystal beading. So pretty.

408
00:23:56,952 --> 00:24:00,587
You're gonna wear your hair down?
You know, to cover the hunchback.

409
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:02,339
The what?

410
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:06,243
Well, since you're ignoring Dr. Torres'
advice about getting the surgery,

411
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:09,212
your shoulder's probably gonna
be pretty swollen. And purple.

412
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:12,866
You know, kind of like a hunchback.
But your hair should cover it.

413
00:24:12,968 --> 00:24:15,352
I mean, probably.
With the right veil.

414
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:21,108
You didn't tell me that. How
soon can we have the surgery?

415
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,231
Dr. Hahn. I heard a
crazy rumor about you.

416
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:31,919
That I'm performing open heart
surgery on a man who's wide awake?

417
00:24:32,021 --> 00:24:34,054
- That's the rumor.
- That's the truth.

418
00:24:34,156 --> 00:24:36,240
I perform awake brain
surgery all the time.

419
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:37,924
Not the same thing.

420
00:24:38,026 --> 00:24:41,545
- Ever heard
of a gentlemen's evening?
- I'm sorry?

421
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,864
The Chief is hosting
a gentlemen's evening.

422
00:24:43,966 --> 00:24:48,752
We're pretty sure it doesn't involve
porn, but, you know, we want to be sure.

423
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:52,172
- Right.
- Are you two a couple?

424
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,541
That's...

425
00:24:54,643 --> 00:24:55,820
- No.
- No.

426
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:57,360
Just checking.

427
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,416
- Why would she ask that?
- I don't know.

428
00:25:03,518 --> 00:25:06,036
I'm worried about
this gentlemen's thing.

429
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,490
George. You got a second?

430
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,160
Seriously?

431
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:14,778
One second.

432
00:25:19,802 --> 00:25:21,585
- Hey.
- Hi.

433
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,354
We'll have to push back
our perfect evening tonight.

434
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,373
Not by much... a
few hours, I think.

435
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:30,077
- Sure. OK.
- OK.

436
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:32,896
I'm about to scrub in on an
awake open heart surgery.

437
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,448
A what?

438
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,535
Patient's going to be awake
while we operate on his heart.

439
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:41,538
- That is intense.
- It is. It is intense. It's...

440
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,943
You know, Cristina
would be all over this.

441
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:48,412
She would be studying
and quizzing herself.

442
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:50,547
And all I can think
about is the poor guy.

443
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:54,067
You know, he's really
nervous already, and...

444
00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:56,069
I'm not hardcore.

445
00:25:56,171 --> 00:26:00,090
- I'm not hardcore enough
for this.
- Yes, you are.

446
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:02,726
Well, you're just
not like Cristina.

447
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:05,128
You're hardcore.

448
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,997
You're hardcore like Izzie.

449
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:13,470
Did that just sound dirty?
Because that's not how I meant it.

450
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,339
- Mean it, man.
- Shut...

451
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:19,860
Go kick ass in the surgery,
and then we'll have our night.

452
00:26:19,962 --> 00:26:22,746
- And it will be perfect.
- I have not shaved my legs yet.

453
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:26,766
- Go be hardcore Izzie. Go!
- Hey, got it. Going.

454
00:26:26,868 --> 00:26:29,702
- Thank you.
- Bye.

455
00:26:31,773 --> 00:26:35,725
- She's hot, man.
- She your wife?

456
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,364
I don't know you well enough
to have this conversation.

457
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:43,566
- Chief? You paged?
- Close the door.

458
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:50,674
You had the nerve to tell a patient you
would perform awake open heart surgery

459
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,876
without running it past me?

460
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,195
Did Burke run every
surgery past you?

461
00:26:55,297 --> 00:26:57,275
Erica, I know you're
new here, but...

462
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:00,433
I want to know what the rules
are. Every surgery Burke booked,

463
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,470
he ran it up the flagpole first?
What about pretty and prettier?

464
00:27:03,572 --> 00:27:05,605
They run all their
surgeries past you?

465
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,825
Talking about
Shepherd and Sloan?

466
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:10,928
I am talking about
your male attendings.

467
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,997
You know, the ones you invited
to your "Gentlemen's evening."

468
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,066
Guess you don't know a
guy till you work for him.

469
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:18,352
Who knew you were
running some old boy's club?

470
00:27:18,454 --> 00:27:20,004
No, that is not it.

471
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:23,507
You realize that an evening, to
which the male attendings are invited

472
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:27,127
and the women are not... You realize
that that's a lot like when law firms

473
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:31,615
used to have country club weekends
and fail to invite the black associates?

474
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,986
Good talk. I got to
prep for my surgery.

475
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:48,282
Remember when I was dead?

476
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:54,738
Before I went in that water,
everything was so complicated.

477
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,207
Hard.

478
00:27:58,694 --> 00:28:02,629
And then you pulled
me out of the water,

479
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:05,666
and I came back to life.

480
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:09,936
For a moment,
everything was so clear.

481
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,893
As if the water had
washed everything clean.

482
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:21,765
- Do you remember that?
- I do.

483
00:28:25,754 --> 00:28:27,620
Me too.

484
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,267
I don't know how you
guys did this for two days.

485
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:35,305
Believe me, I would be at city
hall tomorrow if that were an option.

486
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:39,810
It is an option. You
could just let go.

487
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:41,445
You let go.

488
00:29:44,132 --> 00:29:47,167
You let go and no big
deal. It's a wedding.

489
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:50,536
I let go and I have to
face the wrath of Dr. Sloan.

490
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:54,757
My mom manages a grocery store.

491
00:29:56,428 --> 00:30:00,396
And ever since I got engaged, she's
been putting herself into serious debt...

492
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:05,252
over hand engraved place
cards and chocolate fountains.

493
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:08,604
It's her dream.

494
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:10,841
My wedding is her dream.

495
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:14,488
This is so important to her.

496
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:17,697
This is what she's been
living for since I can remember.

497
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:20,801
Since... my dad left.

498
00:30:22,837 --> 00:30:25,955
My perfect night.

499
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:30,443
So... I can do this.

500
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:34,364
I can do this for her.

501
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:37,834
Because she's done a lot for me.

502
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,288
Whoa.

503
00:30:44,626 --> 00:30:46,910
Get me a crash cart right now.

504
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:50,347
What's going on? What are
you doing? What's happening?

505
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:54,651
Must have happened
when she fell this morning.

506
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:57,971
Which means she's bleeding
all day. She seemed just fine.

507
00:30:58,073 --> 00:31:01,258
Well, she must have been
feeling some major pain.

508
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,194
Yeah. Holding onto that
dress... that wasn't easy for her.

509
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:06,479
It was humiliating. It was...

510
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:10,650
But, when someone's trying to
break you, it gives you drive. Strength.

511
00:31:10,752 --> 00:31:15,672
Holding onto that dress for hours...
I mean, days, you know. Just...

512
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:19,642
God, in public. Refusing
to buckle, refusing to beg.

513
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:23,980
That's hardcore. I mean, in its
own way, that's seriously hardcore.

514
00:31:24,065 --> 00:31:29,536
Rumor has it that Sloan was
busy hazing one of his interns today.

515
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:33,290
I take it you didn't buckle?

516
00:31:36,344 --> 00:31:38,845
No, sir.

517
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,482
Good man, O'Malley.

518
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:03,086
I can't feel anything
from the neck down.

519
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:07,857
It's almost like the rest
of me just... doesn't exist.

520
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,297
OK, the sound you're
about to hear, that's the saw.

521
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:16,199
- - That's... That's
not a pretty sound.

522
00:32:16,302 --> 00:32:20,620
I brought you some music. Just
listen to this and tune it all out.

523
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,593
And... And that smell?

524
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:30,063
- That... That smell is not...
- That's the cautery. I know it's hard,

525
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:34,133
but you'll get used to it. In a moment
or two, you won't notice it. I promise.

526
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:47,897
He jumped out of that plane.
No one forced him to do it.

527
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,367
Fell 12,000 feet.

528
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,770
People chasing death down
and then trying to cheat it.

529
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:56,373
Doesn't make any
kind of sense to me.

530
00:32:56,475 --> 00:33:00,493
There's a clarity thing when
you cross over the edge.

531
00:33:01,763 --> 00:33:06,082
There's a moment when
everything just melts away...

532
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:08,117
and you're fearless.

533
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:13,639
I get it. I understand
wanting to feel like that.

534
00:33:19,481 --> 00:33:23,166
- Oh, hey. Hi, there. You're awake.
- Did I win?

535
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:26,369
You should know that
your surgery went very well.

536
00:33:28,957 --> 00:33:33,043
But who won? Is
she still holding on?

537
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:36,046
Helena collapsed.
She's in surgery.

538
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:37,597
So... So I won?

539
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:42,201
She... She collapsed which...
which means I won, right?

540
00:33:42,303 --> 00:33:45,255
Where's... Where's the judge?

541
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:48,591
The woman that you stood
next to for two days almost died.

542
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,760
OK, you've just
woken up from surgery,

543
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:54,246
and all that you can think about
is if you've won a stupid contest?

544
00:33:54,349 --> 00:33:57,367
Don't you get it? You shouldn't
have to fight this hard for a wedding.

545
00:33:57,469 --> 00:34:01,037
You fight for a marriage. And,
sometimes, even that is a lost cause.

546
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,356
Sometimes you have
to know when to let go.

547
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:07,827
So just let go, already, all
right? Just fricking let go!

548
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:14,200
Yeah. But did... Did I win?

549
00:34:15,837 --> 00:34:20,807
<i>♪ When you gonna
let somebody in ♪</i>

550
00:34:31,953 --> 00:34:34,521
Izzie stuck a picture of a
bird on an empty saline bag

551
00:34:34,623 --> 00:34:35,988
and put it in his eyeline.

552
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,725
That was smart. I wouldn't
have thought of that.

553
00:34:40,895 --> 00:34:42,528
Yeah.

554
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:50,820
She doesn't let
me take care of her.

555
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:56,742
It's not my job anymore.
She won't let me.

556
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,614
I'm taking care of her.

557
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:09,339
You're... You're...

558
00:35:09,424 --> 00:35:11,925
You're looking at my heart?

559
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:15,361
You're looking at
my actual heart?

560
00:35:15,463 --> 00:35:18,614
Better than that,
Mr. Arnold, we're fixing it.

561
00:35:21,836 --> 00:35:24,904
And... all those people?

562
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:30,710
Up there in the observation deck?
They're... They're looking at it too?

563
00:35:30,812 --> 00:35:32,511
They are.

564
00:35:36,017 --> 00:35:38,250
People watching me?

565
00:35:38,352 --> 00:35:42,154
People watching me instead of...

566
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:45,125
It's... It's so weird.

567
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:49,261
To be the one being
watched. It... It's so weird!

568
00:35:49,363 --> 00:35:52,265
How you doing there,
Mr. Arnold? You need anything?

569
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:55,935
It's cold. Cold... Cold in here.

570
00:35:56,037 --> 00:35:58,805
I... I need to cover up.

571
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:02,175
Cover me up, OK?

572
00:36:02,277 --> 00:36:03,757
- Cover me up.
- OK.

573
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:05,828
- Cover me up!
- Yeah, we're going to...

574
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,898
We're going to cover your legs
with more blankets right now.

575
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,752
Cover me up! OK? OK!

576
00:36:12,854 --> 00:36:15,521
- His heart rate's up to 168.
- Damn it.

577
00:36:15,624 --> 00:36:17,607
Everybody's watching!

578
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:21,428
I... and... I need
to be covered up.

579
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:24,563
I... I need...! I
can't stay like this.

580
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:28,385
I can't stay like this! You...
You need... I can't! I can't!

581
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:32,004
No, stop right now! Just...
Just stop the surgery!

582
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,557
Stop! Stop! Stop it!

583
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:38,628
Stop! Stop!

584
00:36:38,713 --> 00:36:41,581
OK? I... I mean it! Get
your hands out of me!

585
00:36:41,683 --> 00:36:43,633
- Please! Stop!
- OK.

586
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:48,288
Mr. Arnold, I need you to calm down
so that your heart can calm down.

587
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:51,207
Mr. Arnold. Mr. Arnold.

588
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:55,295
Look at me. Look
at me! Good. OK.

589
00:36:55,397 --> 00:36:58,415
Now I want you to focus
on the observation deck, OK?

590
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,751
Pretend that it's a treeline
or a shoreline or something.

591
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:05,355
Something with birds. Those aren't
people watching you, those are birds.

592
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:08,942
And you're watching them. So
tell me, Mr. Arnold, about the birds.

593
00:37:09,044 --> 00:37:11,644
- Tell me. Tell me about the birds.
- I can't. I can't.

594
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,483
Yes, you can. How about
her? That woman in the far left.

595
00:37:16,585 --> 00:37:18,485
What kind of bird would she be?

596
00:37:18,587 --> 00:37:23,339
OK. OK. Uh, uh, I guess, um...

597
00:37:23,424 --> 00:37:27,026
She... She has a long neck.
So she'd... she'd be an ibis.

598
00:37:27,128 --> 00:37:30,579
- Some kind of ibis.
- OK, good. Great. Great.

599
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,531
Who's next?

600
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:36,419
OK... That one.

601
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:41,124
Doing... Doing that little...
dance with her fingers.

602
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:46,529
She's... She's the
Purple Sandpiper.

603
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:51,350
Yeah. Those are
tough little birds.

604
00:37:51,452 --> 00:37:53,720
Those are survivors.

605
00:37:53,822 --> 00:37:59,792
And... And him... with
the... the sad eyes.

606
00:37:59,894 --> 00:38:04,730
Uh, he would... He's a thrush.

607
00:38:04,832 --> 00:38:09,102
A Black-headed
Nightingale Thrush.

608
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:16,760
And... And the tall
one. Standing there.

609
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:19,228
Watching over everything,

610
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:22,131
over... everyone.

611
00:38:23,018 --> 00:38:25,118
He doesn't miss a thing.

612
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,404
He's a...

613
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:32,442
Great Blue Heron.

614
00:38:34,762 --> 00:38:36,179
No question.

615
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:52,112
Hey. How's... How's your
bride? She pull through OK?

616
00:38:52,214 --> 00:38:55,365
- Yeah.
- Please tell me
that you let go first.

617
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:59,035
I absolutely cannot handle
my bride winning that wedding.

618
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:07,259
- What?
- Oh, nothing. I just...

619
00:39:07,361 --> 00:39:13,199
I just didn't know if we would
ever be able to talk again.

620
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,954
I'm letting go.

621
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:22,742
I have to... let go.

622
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:34,620
Hey. Why didn't you tell
anybody you were hurting?

623
00:39:34,722 --> 00:39:38,908
- You would've made me let go.
- Hell yeah, I would've.

624
00:39:42,197 --> 00:39:46,365
- Guess I lost anyway.
- No, actually, I let go first.

625
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:51,754
- You did?
- Someone had to catch you.

626
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:57,260
Here. A hundred
grand. Have a nice life.

627
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,348
We won!

628
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:06,552
Oh, my God. I can't
believe I'm crying over this.

629
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:10,223
We did this. We
actually did this.

630
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:13,226
No, sweetie. You did it.

631
00:40:14,229 --> 00:40:16,078
This was all you.

632
00:40:21,569 --> 00:40:26,005
I know this sounds ridiculous,
but I'm a little disappointed.

633
00:40:26,107 --> 00:40:28,540
I mean, I survived a
12,000-foot free-fall

634
00:40:28,642 --> 00:40:30,905
and this is gonna
be my only scar?

635
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:34,330
- It goes away.
- The scar?

636
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,050
The feeling.

637
00:40:37,152 --> 00:40:40,954
That feeling that you
have right now, today?

638
00:40:41,056 --> 00:40:44,607
That feeling, like you
could do anything?

639
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:48,494
That clarity? It goes away.

640
00:40:48,596 --> 00:40:50,830
And you go right back
to being the coward

641
00:40:50,932 --> 00:40:53,732
who can't tell the person
you love how you feel.

642
00:40:55,687 --> 00:41:00,456
- I saw your video.
- You saw...?

643
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,460
Oh. OK.

644
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:07,463
But you're not going
to let Sally see it, right?

645
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,849
You're not going to let
her know what I said?

646
00:41:09,951 --> 00:41:13,753
Like I said. It goes away.

647
00:41:13,855 --> 00:41:17,573
It's going away right now. You
have to tell her how you feel.

648
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:20,343
Right now, while you still can.

649
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:23,880
She's just so incredible. I
mean, at everything she does.

650
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:27,282
She's way out of my
league. You don't understand.

651
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:30,202
There is no way that she
could feel the same way that...

652
00:41:30,305 --> 00:41:33,956
Well, if she doesn't feel the
same way, then you move on.

653
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:39,412
But if you never find out how she
feels? Then that won't be your only scar.

654
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:52,558
He doesn't have any secret
fetishes, right? He really...

655
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:56,078
He doesn't strike me
as a fetish kind of guy.

656
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,931
Richard. You got to tell us
what this evening is about.

657
00:41:59,033 --> 00:42:02,668
You've been obtuse, it's been fun,
but we're getting freaked out now.

658
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,954
What's a gentlemen's evening?

659
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:08,307
It's an evening with no
ladies. Just gentlemen.

660
00:42:08,409 --> 00:42:10,576
- That's it?
- Well, yeah.

661
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:13,245
Pretty boys living in the woods.

662
00:42:13,347 --> 00:42:18,250
This is very charming.
Or sad. Not sure which.

663
00:42:18,352 --> 00:42:21,070
- What happened to no ladies?
- Yeah.

664
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:23,005
Plans change.

665
00:42:25,644 --> 00:42:27,860
Hey, what are you doing tonight?

666
00:42:28,596 --> 00:42:30,747
As in, uh...?

667
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:33,999
Um... What are
you doing tonight?

668
00:42:37,371 --> 00:42:39,872
Look... I'm not a nice guy.

669
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:43,209
I don't date. I don't
call the next day.

670
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:46,951
I'm not looking for a relationship
because I'm never good at them.

671
00:42:47,048 --> 00:42:50,633
And, honestly, I'm kind of
hung up on somebody else, so...

672
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:53,869
The only thing you're ever going
to get from me is sex. That's it.

673
00:42:53,972 --> 00:42:57,373
And... that's never
enough for girls like you.

674
00:43:00,145 --> 00:43:04,347
<i>Deep down, everyone wants
to believe they can be hardcore.</i>

675
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:07,015
<i>But being hardcore isn't
just about being tough.</i>

676
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:08,484
This is just unfair!

677
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:12,671
In your face, banker! Park Place
is mine. Give it up. Come on.

678
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:15,408
- Yeah! With a hotel!
- I think you owe him money.

679
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,744
- Take a look at that!
<i>- It's about acceptance.</i>

680
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,447
George.

681
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:36,312
I'm exhausted.

682
00:43:36,414 --> 00:43:42,368
Every bone and every
muscle in my body... aches.

683
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:45,488
And I don't think I
can do this. I don't...

684
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:49,792
It's not that I don't want to,
because I do. I really, really do.

685
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:54,430
It's just... I just spent six and a
half hours on my feet in surgery,

686
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:58,767
and I can barely hold myself
up. And I'm just so tired.

687
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:02,522
This is... This is like
a rare bird, George.

688
00:44:02,624 --> 00:44:06,141
You know, I mean, it's the first
time that we're together since...

689
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:09,745
since we were together and it's
a once in a lifetime experience,

690
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:11,347
I don't want to waste it.

691
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:14,717
I don't want to waste it on a night
that I'm too exhausted to enjoy it

692
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:19,789
because I want to enjoy our rare bird,
George! I need to enjoy our rare bird!

693
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:23,693
Me too. I... And...

694
00:44:23,795 --> 00:44:29,198
Oh, my hand is just... it's just
killing me from holding that dress. Ow.

695
00:44:29,283 --> 00:44:34,603
So, maybe... Maybe
tonight's not the perfect night.

696
00:44:34,706 --> 00:44:37,807
Well, maybe a perfect
night is another night.

697
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:42,678
- Really?
- Yeah.

698
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,780
Yeah.

699
00:44:49,204 --> 00:44:52,771
Do you want to, maybe...

700
00:44:52,873 --> 00:44:54,924
- go to sleep?
- Yeah.

701
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,677
- Yeah.
- OK.

702
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:04,583
- Oh, thanks.
- It's OK.

703
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:14,493
Did you only shave
one of your legs?

704
00:45:14,595 --> 00:45:17,163
- I know! I'm sorry!
- No.

705
00:45:17,265 --> 00:45:21,400
No, I was just wondering. That's
cool. It's OK. I'm sorry. Sorry.

706
00:45:21,502 --> 00:45:23,468
I couldn't get to it.

707
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:28,573
<i>Sometimes you have to give yourself
permission to not be hardcore for once.</i>

708
00:45:28,676 --> 00:45:31,977
- Maybe I should take
a sleeping pill.
- No, don't do that.

709
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,848
You'll just get strung out and
turn into a bad afterschool special.

710
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:39,185
We'll just sleep
and you'll sleep.

711
00:45:41,856 --> 00:45:44,323
I can't stop, Cristina.

712
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:48,193
I just can't stop seeing Derek.

713
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:55,751
And it's not about the
sex. It's not... about the sex.

714
00:45:56,654 --> 00:45:59,889
It's about that
moment afterward.

715
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:04,626
When the world stops.

716
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,630
It just feels so safe.

717
00:46:11,035 --> 00:46:13,169
So safe.

718
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:17,390
I'm not ready to give that up.

719
00:46:20,328 --> 00:46:22,961
Does that make me sad
and weak and pathetic?

720
00:46:23,064 --> 00:46:25,097
A little bit.

721
00:46:29,303 --> 00:46:31,454
What do I do?

722
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,325
I don't know.

723
00:46:36,427 --> 00:46:39,996
<i>You don't have to be tough
every minute of every day.</i>

724
00:46:40,098 --> 00:46:42,198
<i>It's OK to let down your guard.</i>

725
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,335
<i>In fact, there are moments when it's
the best thing you could possibly do.</i>

726
00:46:56,014 --> 00:46:59,514
<i>As long as you choose
your moments wisely.</i>

727
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:11,427
Alex, please tell me that you
don't live with Meredith Grey.
