00:00:02,236 --> 00:00:04,787
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:08,056
You're not attracted to me.
You think you are, you're not.

3
00:00:08,158 --> 00:00:11,776
You are nowhere near hardcore
enough to commit to cardio.

4
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:13,978
- Why isn't this easier?
- I don't know.

5
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:16,275
Well, I want my
best friend back.

6
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:19,345
You deserve the job. I
should have given it to you.

7
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:21,403
Things are gonna
be different here.

8
00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:24,038
Your love lives, your
hopes and dreams,

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,527
the joys and tragedies that make you
who you are have no place in my hospital.

10
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:32,064
- This is our son.
- He's beautiful.

11
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:42,474
<i>We go into medicine
because we want to save lives.</i>

12
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:46,211
<i>We go into medicine
because we want to do good.</i>

13
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:49,030
<i>We go into medicine
for the rush...</i>

14
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:52,184
<i>for the high...</i>

15
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:53,401
<i>for the ride.</i>

16
00:00:53,503 --> 00:00:55,571
- You're not dancing.
- I'm too tense.

17
00:00:55,673 --> 00:00:58,290
- Which is why we're dancing!
- My problem is,

18
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:02,076
I'm sleeping with a man who's
dating. I don't care if he dates Sydney.

19
00:01:02,178 --> 00:01:05,430
It's the woman he dates after
Sydney. That's my problem.

20
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,517
If I had any sense, I would
break up with the breakup sex.

21
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:12,287
There would be no more breakup
sex-ing. If I had any sense...

22
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:14,339
Shut up! Dance it out.

23
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:19,461
<i>But what we remember,
at the end of most days,</i>

24
00:01:19,563 --> 00:01:21,229
<i>are the losses.</i>

25
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,531
<i>What we lay awake
at night replaying</i>

26
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,869
<i>is the pain we caused
or failed to cure.</i>

27
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:30,989
<i>The lives we ruined
or failed to save.</i>

28
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,892
You know, I'm gonna tell him.

29
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:37,179
- I don't want him
seeing other people.
- Fine. Whatever.

30
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:40,515
I'm gonna tell him.
And I feel good about it.

31
00:01:40,617 --> 00:01:42,584
Dancing makes you brave.

32
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:47,473
<i>So the experience
of practicing medicine</i>

33
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:50,125
<i>rarely resembles the goal.</i>

34
00:01:50,227 --> 00:01:52,578
<i>The experience, too often,</i>

35
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:56,381
<i>is ass-backwards
and upside down.</i>

36
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:02,304
- Hey.
- I'm so sick
of Meredith and Cristina

37
00:02:02,406 --> 00:02:06,241
and their stupid love affair that
they have to rub in everyone's faces.

38
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:09,644
It's stupid dancing. Frigging
Bobbsey Twins. It's stupid!

39
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:12,798
You're ranting. It's early
in the morning for ranting.

40
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,402
We're supposed to be the happy ones.
We should be dancing. Why aren't we?

41
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,237
You want to dance?

42
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:23,041
Whatever. I'm gonna go in early.

43
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:27,129
I'm gonna get on hardcore Erica
Hahn cardio, and I'm gonna kick ass at it.

44
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,631
When I kick ass, it's
gonna piss Cristina off.

45
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,051
But it won't matter because
I'll be a kick-ass cardio god.

46
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:44,479
- I'm just saying,
you're never here.
- Hold on, hold on.

47
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,147
I mess up the rotation schedule,

48
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,400
the residents are
gonna dog me all week.

49
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:51,420
- OK.
- You're never here.

50
00:02:51,522 --> 00:02:54,739
I'm here in the mornings.
I'm here at night.

51
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,960
- Between midnight and 6am.
- I'm chief resident now.

52
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:01,246
And I'm loading the dishwasher!

53
00:03:10,707 --> 00:03:12,340
Hi.

54
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:19,264
You volunteered

55
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,934
to stay home with T-U-C-K.

56
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,620
Who else was gonna
take care of T-U-C-K?

57
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:27,839
I'm late for work.

58
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,744
- Hey, honey.
- We need to talk.

59
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:37,732
OK, take the baby by your
mom and meet me for lunch. OK?

60
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:41,236
- We'll talk then.
- Well, why can't we
talk here?

61
00:03:41,338 --> 00:03:44,473
I'm only here between the
hours of midnight and 6am.

62
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:49,277
Come on. Now, just meet me
for lunch, Tucker. Come on, now.

63
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:53,632
- Lunch.
- Yes, lunch.

64
00:03:59,623 --> 00:04:03,659
Thatcher's not my problem. He can
get drunk all he wants. I don't care.

65
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:06,294
- Right.
- I don't care
about Lexie, either.

66
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:09,142
She's a big girl, she
can take care of herself.

67
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,851
You talk about them an awful
lot for someone who doesn't care.

68
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:16,070
You care because you're you.

69
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:23,945
You're gonna make me late
for my meeting with Sloan.

70
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:25,914
Well, OK then, go.

71
00:04:31,454 --> 00:04:33,154
What?

72
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,226
Nothing. I'm gonna be late.

73
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:45,767
- Hey.
- I'm late
for Sloan's meeting.

74
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:49,237
- Yeah, so am I.
- Also, I'm not
speaking to you.

75
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:05,003
- I'm still not
speaking to you.
- You don't have to speak.

76
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,306
Late for Sloan.

77
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,111
OK, ladies and gentlemen,
this is Nick Hanscomb.

78
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:15,313
- Hi.
- Nick was lucky enough

79
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:19,217
to have me remove a large
carotid body tumor from his neck.

80
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,587
That I was able to get clean
boundaries is pretty darn impressive,

81
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,606
- even for me.
- Congratulations.

82
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,157
Don't interrupt.

83
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,293
Now, despite the fact that it
was a wildly successful surgery,

84
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:32,013
we had to dissect out deep
lymph nodes in his neck.

85
00:05:32,115 --> 00:05:34,715
There is now only a
delicate flap of skin

86
00:05:34,818 --> 00:05:37,485
between his carotid artery
and the outside world.

87
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,955
That said, what
am I worried about?

88
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,385
I'd think given the
friability of the skin,

89
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,861
that there's a great possibility
that the artery could blow.

90
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:47,963
Right.

91
00:05:48,065 --> 00:05:50,081
Don't worry, I've
heard this before.

92
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,466
If that happens,
whoever's in the room,

93
00:05:52,568 --> 00:05:55,337
I don't care if it's a
doctor, a nurse, an orderly,

94
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,256
your job is to
stop the bleeding,

95
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:03,128
then page me, in that order.
Are we clear? Any questions?

96
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:06,597
- They look scared.
- They're professionals.

97
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,234
A healthy level of
fear is encouraged.

98
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:10,868
OK, then.

99
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,206
If I do die, it will have
been lovely meeting you all.

100
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:20,746
See? The patient is confident,
you should be confident. That's it.

101
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:24,466
- What do we got?
- Jacob Nolston, 47,

102
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:27,435
status post his double
bypass surgery two weeks ago,

103
00:06:27,537 --> 00:06:30,622
febrile with tenderness
in his surgical incisions.

104
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,991
We got a ten car
pileup, mind taking him?

105
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:35,177
- You got it.
- I need a gurney.

106
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,377
I'll page Hahn.

107
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,341
We all agree. Get
him inside and flip for it.

108
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,265
- You're in good hands.
- Thank you.

109
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,785
One, two, three.

110
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:47,488
- You're in over your head.
- You don't own
the cardio department.

111
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,207
- He's my patient. First dibs.
- Hey, you guys.

112
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,161
- You can't call dibs.
- I think you should move!

113
00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:55,196
- Let go of the gurney.
- You let go!

114
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:56,948
Move!

115
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:18,798
- My leg!
- Are you OK?

116
00:07:18,822 --> 00:07:20,455
I'm good. Let's go.

117
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,325
Coming through!

118
00:07:23,427 --> 00:07:26,911
Call the fire department.
Get some gurneys out here.

119
00:07:32,135 --> 00:07:34,202
Ray? Ray, can you hear me?

120
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:35,970
Stan?

121
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,573
Stan?

122
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,609
- Oh, my God.
- Stan? Open your eyes, man.

123
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:49,534
Oh, man. Don't
scare me like that.

124
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,347
Let's get you guys out of there.

125
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,755
No! Stop! Stop.
Don't touch anything.

126
00:07:53,857 --> 00:07:57,108
Don't touch anything until Fire
stabilizes. Doors aren't gonna budge.

127
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,930
Torres! I need your
help here! Get the driver!

128
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:04,416
On my way! All right, just page somebody
to help you and keep them talking.

129
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:06,667
- You got this?
- Yeah.

130
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:15,426
- Don't leave. Don't.
- OK.

131
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,810
Somebody page the chief!

132
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:23,751
- Hey, you OK?
- No.

133
00:08:23,853 --> 00:08:26,187
But I'm not as
bad off as this guy.

134
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,573
He started coding
after we picked him up.

135
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,959
And Mary had
some kind of seizure.

136
00:08:31,061 --> 00:08:34,396
Mary? Mary, come
on girl, wake up!

137
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:36,217
- I need help.
- There's no pulse.

138
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:39,634
- Call the coroner. Let me check you.
- No. Is she dead?

139
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:42,386
- I'll go around.
- No, but she looks postictal.

140
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,735
A bad elbow dislocation and
weak pulse. Can you grab this?

141
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,693
She was driving, talking to
me. She started convulsing,

142
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:51,446
- and then we slammed
into that rig.
- Can you move?

143
00:08:51,548 --> 00:08:53,364
Yeah.

144
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,395
You know I need to stabilize
you. You know the drill.

145
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:58,286
My c-spine's clear. I can walk.

146
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:01,555
Well, come on.
Where are you injured?

147
00:09:01,658 --> 00:09:04,492
My gut. Upper abdomen.

148
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:06,995
I know this is going
to sound weird,

149
00:09:07,097 --> 00:09:09,897
but think you could
get me a guy doctor?

150
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:18,673
- How am I doing?
- Strong and stable.

151
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:20,374
Strong and stable.

152
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:23,876
Two words that have never
been used to describe me. Ever.

153
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,635
You're a pretty girl. I hope
you don't think that's rude.

154
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,177
I'm just... I haven't
been allowed to notice

155
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,251
that kind of thing for a while.

156
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:38,476
- Now I'm allowed.
- You're allowed
to notice prettiness?

157
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:41,929
Well, I'm allowed to
notice other women.

158
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:44,511
Women other than my girlfriend.

159
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,769
- My now ex-girlfriend.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

160
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:51,706
Yeah, giant neck
tumors weren't her thing.

161
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:54,275
- She left because
of the tumor?
- No.

162
00:09:54,377 --> 00:09:59,097
No. She left me because I
didn't make her laugh anymore.

163
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:03,618
And she had just
lost that loving feeling.

164
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,221
She left you because
of the tumor. That sucks.

165
00:10:07,323 --> 00:10:09,707
Yep.

166
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,922
You seeing anyone? I'm
just making conversation.

167
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:17,265
My artery is exposed,
which kind of limits my game.

168
00:10:17,968 --> 00:10:20,418
OK... yes.

169
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,386
Well, kind of. I am.

170
00:10:22,472 --> 00:10:26,624
- Nice guy?
- Yeah, he is.

171
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,327
Well, he's kind of...
he's kind of a nice guy

172
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:32,413
- disguised as a jerk.
- Oh, yeah,
I know that type.

173
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:38,085
My girlfriend was a nice girl
disguised as a vapid narcissist.

174
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:39,427
But then it turned out

175
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:42,674
she really was just
a vapid narcissist.

176
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:45,393
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

177
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:47,373
So you really like this guy?

178
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,113
Even though he doesn't have

179
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,899
a super-cool exposed
carotid artery?

180
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,020
Yeah. I do.

181
00:10:58,274 --> 00:11:00,841
What's going on in the
pit? They wiped the board.

182
00:11:00,943 --> 00:11:03,744
A couple of ambulances
crashed into each other.

183
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:04,957
I'm canceling electives

184
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:07,061
to free ORs for
emergent surgeries.

185
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,917
- Are we friends yet?
- I'm sorry?

186
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,870
Friends. Are we friends?

187
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:14,505
I know I just learned
your name and all, Rose.

188
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,675
But I'd like to think I
could call you a friend.

189
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:19,944
- Why?
- Because,
if I'm your friend,

190
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,213
I'd tell you about
licorice in your teeth,

191
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:26,033
where as an acquaintance, I'd smile
politely and pretend it wasn't there.

192
00:11:26,135 --> 00:11:27,735
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

193
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:29,887
- Jacob!
- Dad!

194
00:11:29,973 --> 00:11:32,407
- Daddy, are you OK?
- Hey, guys.

195
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:35,076
- You OK?
- What happened to your leg?

196
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:38,028
There was a...
a little accident,

197
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,481
but I'm OK. It doesn't hurt.

198
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:43,901
- What kind of an accident?
- The ambulances crashed.

199
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,553
The ambulances crashed?

200
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:48,123
Sandra, tell your
mother not to panic.

201
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:50,641
Stop panicking, Mom.

202
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:53,361
- Is his heart OK?
- What's your name?

203
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,346
- Lucy.
- Lucy, I'm Izzie.

204
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,981
Your dad's heart is hurt,

205
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,350
but we're gonna work
hard to make it better.

206
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,336
- I was paged? Dr. Yang?
- Jacob Nolston,

207
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:04,684
two weeks post-op from a CABG.

208
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,402
My exam suggests
a sternal infection.

209
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:09,827
- Our initial exam.
- He also sustained
injuries to his leg

210
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:13,814
- from an accident
outside the ER.
- OK, Stevens,

211
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:15,377
when you can tear yourself away,

212
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,852
page Torres about
the shrapnel in this leg.

213
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:21,022
And you can work with
her today. I only need one.

214
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:25,326
- No.
- You have
to let me examine you.

215
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:28,713
I can wait. I'll wait for a guy.

216
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:33,017
You're shy. OK, I get
that. This is no time for shy.

217
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,821
Now, my hands may be smaller than
a man's, but my brain is much larger,

218
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,141
I assure you. Now, you're
just going to have let me...

219
00:12:40,243 --> 00:12:44,678
- No! Do not... Do not touch me!
- For the love of...

220
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,947
Dr. Bailey. An
emergent situation?

221
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:50,885
Says he wants a male doctor. He
doesn't want female hands to touch him.

222
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:53,104
Let me see his chart.

223
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:56,740
Um, Shane, I'm Dr. Webber.

224
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:59,877
- I'm going to palpate
your abdomen...
- No, no.

225
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,831
- You said he wanted
a male doctor.
- He did.

226
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:07,801
I just... I meant
I want another...

227
00:13:07,903 --> 00:13:12,006
I want a different doctor.
I'll wait for a different doctor.

228
00:13:12,108 --> 00:13:15,226
A different doctor?

229
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,468
You mean you
want a white doctor.

230
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:31,726
I have paramedics
hanging upside down.

231
00:13:32,962 --> 00:13:36,764
Can you handle... this?

232
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:39,984
Yes, sir. I can.

233
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:46,574
- Dr. Torres.
- This is Mary Daltry.

234
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:48,876
She lost consciousness
behind the wheel.

235
00:13:48,978 --> 00:13:51,412
- You're the neuro guy?
- Yes, I'm Dr. Shepherd.

236
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:53,798
- Why did I have a seizure?
- I don't know.

237
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,368
I've never had a seizure
before. I mean, I'm fine.

238
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:01,388
Except, apparently, I
caused this accident.

239
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,819
Call Radiology, let's
get her in for an MRI.

240
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,260
- Yes, sir.
- How's Shane? My partner?

241
00:14:06,362 --> 00:14:08,746
- Does anybody know?
- He's with Dr. Bailey.

242
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,716
- That's good.
- Ready to fix the arm. Are you ready?

243
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,836
- Is it gonna hurt?
- Yes, but...

244
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,103
George.

245
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:18,672
But Dr. Torres is very good.

246
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,425
- OK, Dr. Shepherd,
are you good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

247
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,724
Soon as I get some more
information, I'll let you know. OK?

248
00:14:24,748 --> 00:14:26,997
- OK.
- All right.

249
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,467
Ow!

250
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,042
How's it going in there, fellas?

251
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:42,563
I think... I think that they
better get us out of here.

252
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:45,499
Yeah. If we're
putting it to a vote,

253
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:48,253
I think we better
get out of here fast.

254
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:51,772
I'm afraid "keep still" is
the best we can do for now.

255
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:54,234
Don't want to make
anything worse.

256
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,578
We'll get you some pain
meds as soon as possible.

257
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,613
- Sir?
- Call me Richard.

258
00:15:01,517 --> 00:15:05,403
Richard, can you tell me...

259
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,457
My legs, are they broken?

260
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,594
- I... I can't see your legs.
- How come?

261
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:18,583
Well, your body is trapped
in the door. You can't feel...

262
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:21,935
- I can't...
- You can't feel that?

263
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,056
I can't.

264
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,692
I can't feel anything.

265
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,881
- His ears are bleeding!
- I see, Ray.

266
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,588
Can you get my wife?

267
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,442
She works here.
She's an x-ray tech.

268
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:47,729
- You bet.
- Stan, don't die on me. You hear me?

269
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:52,566
- I'll be so pissed
if you die on me.
- I'm doing my best, man.

270
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:02,126
- Get Stan's wife here now.
- What do we... How do we...?

271
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:03,961
We don't.

272
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,881
- We have a whole hospital...
- The moment we move him,

273
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:08,516
he's gonna bleed out.

274
00:16:08,618 --> 00:16:11,552
All the medicine in the
world won't save him.

275
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:15,254
His wife has to get here soon if
she wants to see her husband alive.

276
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,857
Now, move.

277
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,288
Everything's clear! Just a
couple more minutes, guys.

278
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:34,041
- Thanks.
- - Go ahead and secure that line.

279
00:16:35,845 --> 00:16:38,212
I'm just checking on you guys.

280
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,434
- Ray, talk to me.
- What?

281
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:48,238
Talk to me. I need you to help
me hold on until Sara gets here.

282
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,642
I'm not helping you hold
on, because you're not dying.

283
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,244
Ray.

284
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,847
Talk to him. Help him.

285
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,256
Remember the night you met Sara?

286
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:08,342
At Joe's?

287
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,846
You used that
stupid line about...

288
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:18,052
The one about the
bet over the song lyrics.

289
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:21,923
Right. Right. What
was that song?

290
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:25,959
It was... It was...

291
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:32,016
"I can see clearly now,

292
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:34,118
the rain is gone."

293
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,574
<i>♪ I can see all
obstacles in my way ♪</i>

294
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,662
<i>♪ It's gonna be a bright ♪</i>

295
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:51,085
<i>♪ Bright, sun-shiny day ♪</i>

296
00:17:51,187 --> 00:17:54,154
<i>♪ It's gonna be a bright ♪</i>

297
00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:57,992
<i>♪ Bright, sun-shiny day ♪</i>

298
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:06,084
- What comes next?
- I don't know.

299
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:12,406
"I think I can make it
now, the pain is gone."

300
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,500
I can't believe
Sara fell for that line.

301
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:31,909
Listen, when you
get out of here,

302
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:35,162
you're gonna have
a great story to tell.

303
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,068
You tell it in the bar.

304
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,371
You tell them

305
00:18:43,472 --> 00:18:46,640
how you got into this accident

306
00:18:46,742 --> 00:18:48,976
and your best friend died.

307
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,413
Chicks love that stuff.

308
00:18:54,584 --> 00:18:59,620
Ray, don't tell Sara that I was
talking about you getting tail

309
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,089
right before I died.

310
00:19:03,826 --> 00:19:06,060
OK.

311
00:19:06,162 --> 00:19:10,598
She should be here any
minute. Just hold on, Stan.

312
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:17,454
Dr. Sloan, I have a patient
13 days status post CABG

313
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,074
- with a sternal infection.
- Remove sternum?

314
00:19:20,176 --> 00:19:22,793
And I need you to manipulate
the pectoral muscles

315
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,780
so we don't leave a hole in
the chest. Can you make time?

316
00:19:25,882 --> 00:19:27,559
Make time for a drink with me?

317
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,485
Did I mention time is a factor here?
I'm looking for a yes or no answer.

318
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:35,723
- As am I.
- This may be
enjoyable to you,

319
00:19:35,825 --> 00:19:38,659
but I have a patient
in serious condition.

320
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:41,629
I came to you. Legend has
it you're the best in plastics.

321
00:19:41,731 --> 00:19:45,799
But if bad jokes and sleazy come-ons
are what I'm in for all afternoon,

322
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:50,654
- I'll page whoever's
second best.
- Dr. Hahn.

323
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,990
I apologize.

324
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:57,394
- And I'll clear my schedule.
- Thank you. OR One.

325
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,847
Why don't you clean this up
here and clear up my schedule

326
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,568
- and you can scrub in.
- Thank you.

327
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:07,421
Sorry about that.

328
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,577
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

329
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,230
- So... coffee?
- I can't.

330
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:20,684
You can't? When I was your
patient, you made time for me.

331
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:25,139
- Because you were my patient.
- I thought it was
because you liked me.

332
00:20:25,241 --> 00:20:26,506
Look, I'm really sorry.

333
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:29,176
I got to finish up and then
I'm scrubbing in on a surgery.

334
00:20:29,278 --> 00:20:32,129
- It's one I've
never seen before.
- Can I watch?

335
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,865
- What?
- Can I watch
the surgery? Can I...?

336
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,447
- Can you sneak me in?
- No.

337
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:37,935
Know how much
trouble I'd get in?

338
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:40,282
Since when are
you a rule follower?

339
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:43,735
There's a dozen people in the
back of the OR and there's a gallery.

340
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,061
- Ava.
- Please?

341
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,518
- We're ready to go.
- Hold off a moment.

342
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,286
His wife's arriving.

343
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,904
Stan, Sara's here.

344
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,857
Stan.

345
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:03,628
Stan, wake up man,
Sara's here! Wake up!

346
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,849
That's good.

347
00:21:10,452 --> 00:21:12,086
- That's good.
- Baby?

348
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:15,789
Baby! Hey.

349
00:21:17,593 --> 00:21:20,338
Your x-ray shows the metal's
embedded in your femur.

350
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,664
I'm gonna go in and remove it
while Dr. Hahn and Dr. Sloan

351
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:25,861
repair the damage
caused by the infection.

352
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,150
Repair the damage?

353
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:30,554
- Mm-hm.
- They're removing
my chest bone.

354
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:33,307
Why is this all happening?

355
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:37,811
My kids shouldn't
have to see me this way.

356
00:21:37,914 --> 00:21:41,498
It's a dad's job to worry.
You worry about your kids.

357
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,735
You worry about them
every day of their lives.

358
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:49,823
But they aren't supposed to have to
worry about dad, to comfort their mom.

359
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:55,011
- Why am I back here? My kids...
- Your kids are fine.

360
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,900
They're taking care of
each other and they're fine.

361
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:03,804
Lucy and the others were hungry,
your wife took them to the cafeteria.

362
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:08,575
The point is, they're fine. They
just want their dad to get better.

363
00:22:08,677 --> 00:22:12,880
You'll keep an eye on
them, when I'm in surgery?

364
00:22:12,982 --> 00:22:14,248
You'll keep them updated?

365
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:17,434
Because my wife, she...

366
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,604
She gets panicky if she
doesn't know what's going on.

367
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,740
I will keep her updated.

368
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:30,765
Uh, I would like to borrow Dr. Yang.
It's important. Can you spare her?

369
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:33,600
Torres! Can I steal
Stevens off your service?

370
00:22:33,702 --> 00:22:36,887
- I'll give her away for free.
- Yang's all yours, Dr. Bailey.

371
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:38,155
Thank you.

372
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:40,624
Yang! Stevens!

373
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:43,627
Dr. Yang, Dr. Bailey has
requested your capable hands.

374
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:47,047
Dr. Stevens, take over
prepping Mr. Nolston for surgery.

375
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,601
- Wait...
- Just take it up
with Dr. Bailey, Yang.

376
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:54,232
- Hey.
- Hey.

377
00:22:54,256 --> 00:22:57,441
- Mary's scans come up yet?
- Not yet.

378
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:03,542
What's going on
with you and Stevens?

379
00:23:03,566 --> 00:23:07,400
Just 'cause I don't sleep in your
house, doesn't mean I don't hear gossip.

380
00:23:07,503 --> 00:23:11,471
Why are we talking
about this? We don't talk.

381
00:23:11,573 --> 00:23:14,508
Oh, you're... You miss
Meredith and you're clinging.

382
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:17,911
- I'm not clinging.
- A little bit,
you're clinging.

383
00:23:18,014 --> 00:23:21,348
- I'm just making small talk.
- OK. Cool.

384
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,983
Here we go.

385
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:31,742
Tumor.

386
00:23:35,698 --> 00:23:39,466
Look, I'm hurt.
I'm really hurt here.

387
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:42,136
You just try not to die.
Someone will be here soon

388
00:23:42,238 --> 00:23:44,638
to save the master
race from extinction.

389
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,375
Can I talk to you for a
minute? I mean no disrespect.

390
00:23:48,477 --> 00:23:52,262
But can you tell me you have an
amazingly good reason for pulling me off

391
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:55,032
of Dr. Hahn's service
when I have been fighting

392
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:58,051
- to get into her good graces.
- You're not black.

393
00:23:58,153 --> 00:23:59,865
But you're not white either.

394
00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:03,089
Dr. Yang will be examining you.

395
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,960
Oh, come on. Are you kidding?

396
00:24:06,062 --> 00:24:08,061
OK, you have medical training.

397
00:24:08,163 --> 00:24:11,815
How long do you think you have
to live if you have internal injuries?

398
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:16,136
Exactly. I seriously recommend
you let this fine doctor examine you.

399
00:24:16,238 --> 00:24:21,392
Dr. Yang, give him the best medical
treatment possible. It's the law.

400
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,695
Sir, I need you to
move your hands.

401
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,081
I just didn't want her to see.

402
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:36,039
I thought she might
take offense, you know?

403
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,274
I'm not gonna
leave you. I'm not.

404
00:24:54,376 --> 00:24:57,377
I'm not leaving here right
now without you, OK? Please?

405
00:24:57,479 --> 00:25:00,798
- I've never seen her before.
- - What?

406
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,185
I've never seen her before. I've
worked in this hospital all this time.

407
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:07,972
Before today, she was a
complete stranger to me.

408
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:11,107
It happens. It's a big hospital.

409
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:14,094
I love you.

410
00:25:14,196 --> 00:25:15,908
I've never met her before,

411
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:19,967
and yet I'm the person who
handed her the worst day of her life.

412
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:24,204
In her story, that's who I am.

413
00:25:24,306 --> 00:25:26,523
That's who I'll always be.

414
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,761
That's the job.

415
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:36,800
That's the job. I know.

416
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:41,421
Look at me.

417
00:25:41,523 --> 00:25:43,657
This day...

418
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:45,425
This day you feel helpless.

419
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:48,011
This day makes
all those other days

420
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:50,764
when you fight to
save a life and lose,

421
00:25:50,866 --> 00:25:56,186
this day makes you grateful you
have a chance to do anything at all.

422
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,641
You take it in.

423
00:26:04,913 --> 00:26:09,415
Ma'am.

424
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,345
It's time.

425
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:27,818
<i>♪ And I don't know if I
could stand another... ♪</i>

426
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,000
- Go easy. I'm injured.
- You've had plenty
of morphine.

427
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:36,026
You'll be fine. Not like you're in
a concentration camp or anything.

428
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,898
When people are young
or drunk, they get tattoos,

429
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,051
- they wake up,
they regret it.
- So you regret it?

430
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:51,508
You got to treat me like anyone
else. That's the beauty of this country.

431
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,577
Yes, it is.

432
00:26:57,099 --> 00:27:01,234
So you're gonna
drill into my skull?

433
00:27:01,336 --> 00:27:02,735
O'Malley?

434
00:27:02,837 --> 00:27:05,250
Dr. Shepherd's gonna
do a cookie craniotomy.

435
00:27:05,274 --> 00:27:09,959
He's gonna drill a very, very small
hole and then, with a computer,

436
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:14,748
he guides the scope through your brain.
It's as minimally invasive as possible.

437
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,635
It's just... It's
weird, you know,

438
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:21,422
to be on the other
side of all this.

439
00:27:21,524 --> 00:27:24,041
How are Stan and Ray?

440
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,744
And Shane? Oh, my God.

441
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:29,412
Oh, my God, how did this happen?

442
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:33,149
She's seizing!

443
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,060
I always knew you were
an ass, but seriously?

444
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:46,580
You brought Jane Doe? Are you
trying to get yourself kicked out?

445
00:27:46,682 --> 00:27:50,550
- She wanted to see what I do.
- I thought you were
seeing Lexie.

446
00:27:50,652 --> 00:27:53,837
- I'm a popular guy.
- - Whatever you're talking about

447
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:55,950
is endlessly
fascinating, Dr. Karev,

448
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:58,603
but I kind of had my heart
set on saving a life today.

449
00:27:58,627 --> 00:28:02,896
- Sorry.
- So... let's begin.

450
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:10,009
Hey, Nurse Olivia said you
needed to see me. Are you OK?

451
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:13,957
My book is bad. And I
hate daytime television.

452
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,544
- And all my friends
are at work.
- I'm at work too.

453
00:28:17,646 --> 00:28:19,780
I'm an intern.
Supposed to be learning.

454
00:28:19,882 --> 00:28:22,177
You can learn about my artery.

455
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,046
You can never know
too much about arteries.

456
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,569
- Come on. I have
no one to talk to.
- Fine.

457
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,790
- But I'm taking
your vitals again.
- OK.

458
00:28:31,593 --> 00:28:34,294
So you want to help
me plot my revenge?

459
00:28:34,396 --> 00:28:37,664
- The girlfriend?
- Uh-huh. Here's
what I'm thinking.

460
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:39,749
I page her here.

461
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:42,319
And then, you
know, I'm all like,

462
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:47,707
"I'm dying. And I just need to
gaze at your beauty one last time."

463
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:51,979
And when she gets
here... I flash her the artery.

464
00:28:52,081 --> 00:28:53,601
- It's mean.
- Right?

465
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,549
- I like it.
- Can you get me a phone?

466
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,305
The moment they pull apart the rig,
we're gonna come in and grab you.

467
00:29:02,391 --> 00:29:05,676
- You take Stan first.
- Once we get in there
and assess,

468
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:09,546
- then we'll see who goes first.
- No. You take Stan first.

469
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:12,282
You take Stan first.

470
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:15,919
Ray, I think I'm gonna be OK.

471
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:18,938
- I'm starting to feel better.
- Don't screw with me.

472
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:23,910
No. No. I'm probably
not as bad as I think.

473
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,429
I'm probably just paralyzed.

474
00:29:27,316 --> 00:29:30,717
Richard, you think, maybe,

475
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:35,322
that I can get out of
here just paralyzed, right?

476
00:29:42,164 --> 00:29:44,665
It's possible. It happens.

477
00:29:44,766 --> 00:29:48,518
- Really?
- See?

478
00:29:50,805 --> 00:29:53,973
OK. OK.

479
00:29:57,029 --> 00:30:01,798
Is my wife inside? She
won't see any of this?

480
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,783
Nope.

481
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,419
You'll be where I
can look at you?

482
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:08,922
I'm right here, where
you can look at me.

483
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:22,769
Then let's do this.

484
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,540
Try to live, man.

485
00:30:29,712 --> 00:30:30,844

Ray. Ray... Ray's back.

It's in deep. He'll bleed
out if you move us.

00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:08,531
It's the oxygen regulator.
It's embedded in his back.

00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,223
I'm here, chief.

498
00:31:17,325 --> 00:31:20,494
I'm still here, but
my pulse is weak.

499
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,582
He's sweaty and breathing fast.

500
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:28,302
And with the angle
of that regulator...

501
00:31:28,404 --> 00:31:29,786
It's cardiac tamponade.

502
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,990
If that regulator caused a tear
in his heart and we move him,

503
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:37,193
- the regulator could move.
- It makes the tear bigger.

504
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:42,749
Please let's don't
flood my heart. Please.

505
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:44,867
We'll stabilize him
in the ambulance.

506
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,338
Stan, you're a hero, man.

507
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,340
You saved Ray's life.

508
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,645
Stan?

509
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:57,648
Stan?

510
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,285
Stan? Damn it, Stan! Stan.

511
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:10,744
Go get the ultrasound
so we can be sure.

512
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,845
And bring in a crash
cart, just in case.

513
00:32:12,947 --> 00:32:15,081
And go find where Hahn is.

514
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,236
- OK.
- The films are up.

515
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:23,206
- Intraperitoneal bleeding.
- His liver looks
completely ruptured.

516
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:26,476
He is gonna need a laparotomy.
Maybe it'll be straightforward.

517
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:29,018
So I can get back
to Hahn's service?

518
00:32:29,064 --> 00:32:33,283
- Or not?
- If I have to work
on this man,

519
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:37,904
- so do you.
- Why? You don't need me.

520
00:32:38,006 --> 00:32:41,207
He has a swastika
on his abdomen.

521
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:42,876
A giant black swastika.

522
00:32:42,978 --> 00:32:45,761
My stepfather's parents
died in Auschwitz.

523
00:32:52,788 --> 00:32:55,622
You and I will do this.

524
00:32:55,724 --> 00:33:00,760
We will do this and we will consider
ourselves having risen above.

525
00:33:00,862 --> 00:33:04,431
We'll rise. Above.

526
00:33:18,447 --> 00:33:20,179
You're busted.

527
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,116
- Save it.
- Mm.

528
00:33:24,218 --> 00:33:26,936
You're using a cable
instead of wires, Dr. Sloan.

529
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,950
I've never seen
it done that way.

530
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:31,591
Tension banding. I
learned it back in New York.

531
00:33:31,693 --> 00:33:36,830
I moved there after Columbia
to study under John Seever.

532
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:39,065
He was a great surgeon.

533
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:42,302
He died last year.
I was wrecked.

534
00:33:42,404 --> 00:33:44,003
Couldn't sleep for weeks.

535
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:47,006
- It was like losing
my own father.
- What are we, on a date?

536
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,626
I was complimenting
your surgical skills,

537
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:53,074
not looking for a window into
your wounded soul. Clamp, please.

538
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,534
You can't operate. I won't
sign the consent form.

539
00:33:57,635 --> 00:34:00,665
You need this surgery. You
will die without the surgery.

540
00:34:00,689 --> 00:34:02,367
You may die with this surgery.

541
00:34:02,391 --> 00:34:05,603
Your chance of living is
increased if you let me operate.

542
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:10,380
- It's just gonna be
you two in there?
- Yes.

543
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:15,351
No. I need to have at least one
white doctor in that operating room,

544
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:18,171
so you don't kill me on
the table. No offense.

545
00:34:18,273 --> 00:34:22,342
No offense? Did he
just say, "No offense"?

546
00:34:22,444 --> 00:34:24,327
- Shepherd. I need O'Malley.
- Yeah?

547
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,529
- We're going into surgery.
- O'Malley.

548
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,381
- You OK?
- Don't cross me.

549
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,967
- I wasn't crossing you.
- I'm rising above.

550
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:35,972
I'm rising above, and do not want
to be crossed while I'm busy rising.

551
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:40,077
I have to operate on
a white supremacist

552
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:42,273
and he has requested
a white doctor

553
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:46,432
to watch me to make sure that I
don't kill his crazy white behind.

554
00:34:46,534 --> 00:34:48,179
I need O'Malley. Can I have him?

555
00:34:48,203 --> 00:34:50,670
- O'Malley,
go with Dr. Bailey.
- Yes, sir.

556
00:34:50,772 --> 00:34:55,024
Get him to sign the consent, then
have him anesthetized and ready.

557
00:34:57,796 --> 00:35:01,547
Dr. Bailey, you are within your
rights to pass this on to somebody.

558
00:35:01,649 --> 00:35:06,886
Well, that would make me
like him. And I'm not like him.

559
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:14,911
Sorry, Dr. Shepherd.
I'm running behind today.

560
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:18,047
- I'll be out of
your way in a second.
- Actually, I'm early,

561
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:21,968
- so technically
I'm in your way.
- Don't let it happen again.

562
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,239
- You're staring at my chest.
- What?

563
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:28,842
I think, maybe, you're
intending to admire my ring,

564
00:35:28,944 --> 00:35:32,645
- but you're staring
at my chest.
- Sorry, it's just that...

565
00:35:32,748 --> 00:35:35,610
you wear your engagement
ring on your necklace.

566
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,733
When I was engaged,
I wore it on my finger.

567
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:41,705
Now, necklace. The stone was my
grandmother's. I don't want to lose it.

568
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:43,487
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry why?

569
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:45,853
Your engagement.
Call it off recently?

570
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:49,963
- That's a pretty
personal question.
- We're friends now.

571
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:54,067
I saved you hours of potential
licorice humiliation. I think you can...

572
00:35:54,169 --> 00:35:56,502
It ended a year ago.
Nothing to be sorry about.

573
00:35:56,605 --> 00:35:58,722
- It was never gonna work out.
- How come?

574
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:03,093
Because I was always very clear
about what I wanted and he... wasn't.

575
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:05,528
And there's no way
to build a future on that.

576
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,697
Yeah.

577
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:15,054
- I can't be in here!
- Ray! Ray! Ray,
you can't do that!

578
00:36:15,156 --> 00:36:18,469
You have to stay perfectly
still! You cannot move.

579
00:36:18,493 --> 00:36:20,760
Ray, look at me.

580
00:36:20,862 --> 00:36:23,730
Don't look at Stan. Look at me.

581
00:36:25,366 --> 00:36:30,036
You are not gonna
die today. OK? Say it.

582
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:35,775
- I am not gonna die.
- You are not going
to die today.

583
00:36:35,877 --> 00:36:39,378
He'll need a pericardiocentesis
if it's a tamponade,

584
00:36:39,481 --> 00:36:41,113
but we need to
get an ultrasound.

585
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:43,427
- I can do it. I can get in.
- Meredith.

586
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,452
I can fit.

Dr. Bailey?

I'm calling on Jesus this time.

593
00:37:15,216 --> 00:37:18,868
Don't bother me when I'm calling
on Jesus. I don't do it very often,

594
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,004
he might not hear me.

00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:14,908
It's amazing, isn't it? How
technical it all is? How impersonal?

603
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:17,421
They're, basically,
just mechanics.

604
00:38:17,445 --> 00:38:18,945
Like God's mechanics,

605
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:22,607
because what they're doing
down there is saving a life.

606
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:27,620
So you're a surgeon?

607
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,957
Surgical intern. First
year. What about you?

608
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:35,177
Oh, um...

609
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,831
I'm not actually
supposed to be here.

610
00:38:38,933 --> 00:38:42,135
The guy that I'm... you know...

611
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,487
Your husband?

612
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:46,940
No. No, no. The...
Not my husband.

613
00:38:47,042 --> 00:38:51,261
The guy that... Anyways, I'm
just... I wanted to see him operate.

614
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:55,565
Oh, Dr. Sloan. Oh, I get
it. No, no. I'm not judging.

615
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:59,302
- I mean, he's kind
of insanely hot.
- Well, he is.

616
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:03,205
But I'm not with
him. I'm with... him.

617
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:11,798
- Do you know him?
- No. No, I don't
know him at all.

618
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:24,343
Supposed to be having lunch
with my husband, O'Malley.

619
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,645
Yes, ma'am.

620
00:39:25,747 --> 00:39:28,714
Supposed to be having
lunch with my husband,

621
00:39:28,816 --> 00:39:34,103
and instead I am elbow
deep in a Nazi's gut.

622
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,788
Yes, ma'am.

623
00:39:40,495 --> 00:39:42,895
No one better ever
call me "Nazi" again.

624
00:39:42,997 --> 00:39:45,315
Yes, ma'am.

625
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:51,337
All right, can I get a little
suction right there, please?

626
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:53,673
That's good. Good.

627
00:39:53,775 --> 00:39:58,777
OK. All right, I should be
able to access the tumor now.

628
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:01,547
Did we lose power?

629
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,733
No, the other monitors are fine.

630
00:40:03,835 --> 00:40:05,802
It must be the
stereotactic computer.

631
00:40:07,689 --> 00:40:09,489
- Nothing. It's dead.
- You kidding?

632
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,942
I'm in the woman's brain. The
navigational system's dead?

633
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:15,978
- Should we get another machine?
- I remove the probe,

634
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:19,476
it won't be the machine that's
dead. Tell the company to get here.

635
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,735
- Tell them we need
somebody here, now.
- Take it slow, Grey.

636
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,317
There's glass all around you.

637
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:39,669
I'm sorry, Stan. I'm so sorry.

638
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,704
Here.

639
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:44,990
He's OK. He doesn't mind.

640
00:40:45,093 --> 00:40:47,243
- We're losing him!
- OK, get in there!

641
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:49,195
Just get in there!

642
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,433
- Hey.
- Hi.

643
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:58,504
- You checking in on me again?
- Yep.

644
00:40:58,606 --> 00:41:00,756
Will you call me strong
and stable again?

645
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,909
Let's hope.

646
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:06,845
What's wrong with you?

647
00:41:06,948 --> 00:41:09,126
What makes you think
something's wrong?

648
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:13,386
Well, your cheeks are all
flushed, which they weren't earlier.

649
00:41:13,488 --> 00:41:16,305
Is it creeping you out how
observant I am? I'm sorry.

650
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,424
It's the boredom,
I'm telling you.

651
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:26,065
Remember your girlfriend who just
turned out to be a vapid narcissist?

652
00:41:26,167 --> 00:41:28,852
Your boyfriend turned
out to just be a jerk.

653
00:41:28,954 --> 00:41:33,289
Jerk. Ass. And many dirtier
words that are inappropriate

654
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:35,511
for me to use in
front of a patient.

655
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:40,596
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, me too.

656
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:43,082
Well, you want me to
help you plot your revenge?

657
00:41:43,184 --> 00:41:46,419
- OK.
- OK.

658
00:41:46,521 --> 00:41:49,672
Here's what I'm thinking.
You go out with me.

659
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:52,641
Just like that, bam.
New boyfriend.

660

00:42:05,257 --> 00:42:08,858
