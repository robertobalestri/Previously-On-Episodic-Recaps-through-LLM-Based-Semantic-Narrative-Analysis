1
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:07,706
What happened?

2
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,519
Betadine, saline
and a suture kit.

3
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:12,077
- What happened?
- She cut herself. An accident.

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,280
- I've got this.
- How much blood has she lost?

5
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:18,383
- Alex.
- She's fine. I've got this.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,053
Given the situation,

7
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:24,656
I'd understand if you didn't
want to proceed with surgery.

8
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,425
But we did learn from Jeremy,

9
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,929
and the formulation of
the cocktail will be adjusted.

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,642
We have not had
a positive outcome.

11
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,299
Liz?

12
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,602
I want to take her home.

13
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:39,404
- I understand.
- No. I want the surgery.

14
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,706
Honey.

15
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:45,444
- That's the grief talking.
- I want the surgery today.

16
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:49,848
Well, there are no other
clinical trials out there.

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,417
No one else has any answers.

18
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,120
- Dr. Shepherd has worked
hard on this.
- Meredith.

19
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,822
We're not letting
you have surgery

20
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,857
because you want
to die with Jeremy.

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,327
If I go home, I die.

22
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,130
I die in a few
weeks, a few days.

23
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:08,066
I don't want to lose you.

24
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,104
Mom, you won't.

25
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:16,174
Because I'm not finished.

26
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,413
Daddy. He loved me.

27
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:24,883
Yeah, you know,
Jeremy really loved me.

28
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:29,487
And he'd be so mad
if... if I just gave up.

29
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:35,327
Please. Do the surgery today.

30
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:45,036
Lola, Andrew's asking for you.

31
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,772
Could you come with me, please?

32
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:53,311
Hey, um, is... Is he OK?

33
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,647
No, he's not OK. He's
stuck in a block of cement.

34
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:58,816
Actual hardening-by-the-second,
concrete cement.

35
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:00,251
How could he be OK?

36
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,290
Wow, you care about him.

37
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,162
He's my friend.

38
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:15,633
I... I know I told you he
wasn't, but he's my friend.

39
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,569
I think he's more than that.

40
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:21,807
And I think you're too proud
to admit it to your friends,

41
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,642
and maybe to yourself.

42
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:26,277
Mommy, I have a
boo-boo. Kiss it better.

43
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:31,449
He is in pain, he is scared,

44
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,751
and he needs someone
he knows to hold his hand.

45
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:37,622
Lola, hold my hand.

46
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,227
Screw what they
think. This matters.

47
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,929
They don't.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,966
I can't help him.

49
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,072
You're gonna hate
yourself for this.

50
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,240
Later.

51
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,744
You're gonna hate yourself
for this, and you'll be right.

52
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,355
- Don't think this looks right.
- Cristina is dyslexic,

53
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:13,658
but she got straight A's during
school and has a Ph.D. Amazing.

54
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,627
Eight letters of recommendation.

55
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,473
This look right?
How you found 'em?

56
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,098
Izzie went to college at
night. Six years to graduate,

57
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,868
volunteered as a candystriper.
Patients wrote letters of rec.

58
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,603
Gotta get outta here.

59
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,007
And Alex, he wrote
this essay to get in,

60
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,409
this moving, beautiful essay

61
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,411
about how his grades
weren't that good.

62
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,146
He was suffering
from testicular cancer.

63
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,559
Ow! What?

64
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,450
He lost a ball. I've
seen him naked.

65
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,453
He has two mangerines,
two pouch potatoes. He lied.

66
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,589
- Stop telling me information.
- One point. Just one point.

67
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:47,191
- How can they keep you back?
- Forget about it!

68
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,993
Photographic memory! I can't.

69
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,965
- We'll get it right with Beth.
- She lost the love of her life.

70
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,868
- You encourage her to surgery?
- Encourage her not to?

71
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,481
Not me with the
big ego, it's you.

72
00:03:58,505 --> 00:03:59,716
You backed me into a corner.

73
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,373
- What was I supposed to do?
- Derek.

74
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:03,352
I can't She's a kid.

75
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,644
She's a kid who's gonna
die without surgery.

76
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,057
She'll die with surgery.
What you and I do.

77
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,441
We kill things over and
over and over again.

78
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:11,594
We've killed 12 people,

79
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,519
and now, because
of you, I will kill a 13th.

80
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,953
Surgery's over, we're done.

81
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,268
Don't wanna work with
you, see you, talk to you.

82
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:19,572
We're done.

83
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,440
OK, Andy, we're ready to begin.

84
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,319
Wait. Is she...?

85
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,978
- Lola?
- She... I couldn't find her.

86
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,147
She went to eat or something.

87
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,716
We need to start the catheter.

88
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:48,920
OK. Now, you're gonna
feel some pressure.

89
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,756
She didn't go to eat. She
just didn't want to come, right?

90
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,362
Lola likes to hang out with me.

91
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,131
Or she did... used to.

92
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:02,367
Before I did this.

93
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,503
Once, she almost...

94
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:08,106
There coulda been a kiss,

95
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,008
but I chickened out.

96
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,443
Well, maybe you don't
need to be kissing her.

97
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:15,947
No, I do. I do. I do
need to be kissing her.

98
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,115
My whole life is
about kissing her.

99
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,384
Catheter's in.

100
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,520
Guys are on their
last piece of cement.

101
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:26,157
Thank God. The
hard part's over, right?

102
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,993
- The hard part's over?
- - Get a crash cart ready.

103
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:34,165
I've got calcium,
D-50 and insulin.

104
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,001
- Ready.
- The hard part is over?

105
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,872
OK, there is a chance

106
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:43,007
that when the nice
gentlemen take off

107
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,445
the final piece of cement
there, on your abdomen,

108
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,947
the toxins that have been
building up underneath

109
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:52,884
the concrete will rush to
your heart, and you'll crash.

110
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:56,855
You... Your heart will stop,
and you'll stop breathing.

111
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,323
But, no, there's no
need to make that face

112
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,059
because we will
restart your heart,

113
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,929
and we will put in a tube
that will breathe for you

114
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,175
and rush you to the OR.

115
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,599
We are good at what we do.

116
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,335
Just, if you see the
warm, welcoming light,

117
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:13,338
do not go into it.

118
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,275
Let's go.

119
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,444
OK, we're gonna
do this on three.

120
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,780
- OK. One.
- Watch the leads.

121
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,915
Two.

122
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,218
Three.

123
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:36,228
- There he goes.
- Clear his airway.

124
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,530
All right. One.

125
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,334
Two. Three.

126
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:45,837
- Easy, easy, easy.
- Push the lidocaine.

127
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,540
- Bailey.
- Got the intubation.

128
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:49,807
Go.

129
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:55,280
I don't know what you mean
when you say she didn't want to die.

130
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:57,749
When you were sitting on
the floor with your mother,

131
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,584
what did she say to you?

132
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:04,722
She told me to be extraordinary.
She said that she had failed,

133
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,658
but that I should
be extraordinary,

134
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,793
that I shouldn't
depend on anyone.

135
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,498
"Be an extraordinary
woman," is what she said.

136
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,568
And so you became a
surgeon, just like her.

137
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,770
- Yes.
- Which means you have the tools

138
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,772
- to figure this out.
- But I just...

139
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,441
You need to work this through.

140
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,277
I promise you, when you
do, you're gonna be glad.

143

- Are... Are you mad at me?
- No.

144
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,199
- Why talk to me in that voice?
- There's no voice.

145
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,668
There's a voice.
And I did you a favor.

146

You didn't do me a favor.

147
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,316
You made it clear
that I'm still me.

148
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,507
The almost guy.

149
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,849
All that separates me
from the rest of my class

150
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,444
is one point?

151
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:02,447
It would've been OK if it was
50 points or ten points, but one?

152
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,649
That means it was right
there, it was in my hand,

153
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,085
and I let it slip away.

154
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,153
I didn't want to know
that. Do you get that?

155
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:13,257
That knowing that if I had just
checked A instead of B, that...

156
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,359
that one point separates
me from freedom.

157
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:16,742
I have been running my tail off,

158
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:20,098

OK.

I've prescribed her
Alprazolam and Clonazepam.

Psych will be down, but
it'd be good to keep her calm.

169
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:55,367
She doesn't need any
drugs or any psych.

170
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:57,668
She needs a psych
consult to be admitted.

171
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,415
- Not admitting her.
- Not taking her.

172

00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,141
You shouldn't have to watch her.

174
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,644
You're not on today so she
was admitted under my name,

175
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,412
which means I decide
the treatment plan.

176
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,058
- She needs to be put on hold...
- Damn it!

177
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,482
Leave us alone,
you stupid bitch.

178
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:18,122
<i>♪ It would be a
lie to run away ♪</i>

179
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,567
You're supposed to sit down.
That's what the breaks are for.

180
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,202
We're on our feet.
Rest your legs.

181
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,270
My legs are good.

182
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,806
Inappropriate, don't you think,

183
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,152
thinking about
sex during surgery?

184
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,677
Just saying what I've
been witnessing all day.

185
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,747
This poor kid's entire body
was encased in cement.

186
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,149
His legs are crushed,

187
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,251
his vessels and nerves
cut off completely,

188
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:49,787
and still... I was turned on.

189
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,890
This entire time I've been
turned on because of you

190
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,860
- and your dirty talk.
- It wasn't my dirty talk.

191
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,829
It's what I was
dirty talking about.

192
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,999
- What?
- Erica. You and Erica.

193
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,568
No. That's...

194
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,780
- No.
- Callie.

195
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,671
- What?
- It's OK.

196
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,541
I wish I was all
someone thought about.

197
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,416
You had 14 letters
of recommendation.

198
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,390
Cristina had eight, Meredith
had four, Izzie had ten.

199
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:28,793
But you had 14. The
words used to describe you...

200
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:30,895
Nobody had
recommendations like yours.

201
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,975
People said the
others were smart,

202
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,710
they said they
were hard workers,

203
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,935
they said that they were
good. But your letters?

204
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,804
They said you were great.

205
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:42,373
They spoke of kindness,
attention to detail.

206
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,010
They talked about how hard
you try, and that you never give up.

207
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,090
They painted a picture
of the kind of doctor

208
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,914
that I hope to become.

209
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,250
It was an honor to
read those letters,

210
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,986
because now I know that what
separates you from the others

211
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,188
isn't one stupid point.

212
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,091
What separates you from
the others is greatness.

213
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:04,629
So don't you dare let
one point hold you back.

214
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,877
- I'm covered in blood. Talk -
fast. Alex brought Rebecca in.

215
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:22,080
She tried to hurt herself.
He's taking Rebecca home.

216
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,348
- And?
- She needs to be admitted.

217
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,350
- She needs a psych consult.
- And?

218
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:29,387
- Can you just do your job?
- I am doing my job.

219
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:33,791
I'm helping a 19-year-old man that I
promised would get to live, get to live.

220
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,660
That's my job as a surgeon.

221
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:37,662
I took my son to
daycare when I came in.

222
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,931
My job as a mother.
I'm asking you,

223
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,466
what are you going to
do about your patient?

224
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:43,634
My job as chief resident.

225
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:46,671
- How about you do your job?
- I can't.

226
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:50,474
- I don't know what to do.
- Stevens. She's your patient.

227
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:55,146
He's... her loved one. Come
on, you know what to do.

228
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,747
It's just hard to do it.

229
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,319
- OK, I'll try.
- No, you don't have to try.

230
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,954
You're a doctor trained by me,

231
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,889
with all the skills
that God gave you.

232
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,891
You have everything you need.

233
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,897
Each one teach one.

234
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:17,135
- Where are we?
- Sloan, Hahn and Torres
are done.

235
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,237
- We're up.
- Unclamped the vein.

236
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:20,772
Blood flow is good to the liver.

237
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:22,484
Right, chief?

238
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,042
Absolutely right. Good job.

239
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:28,312
Good. Then we're ready to...

240
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,559
I think I liked it better
when you were saying

241
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:44,962
boring science stuff.

242
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,535
I'm never good enough.

243
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,238
No matter what I
say or what I do.

244
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,142
I never wanted to do this.

245
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,379
This clinical trial is
making me a failure.

246
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:10,888
I fail her over
and over and over.

247
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,426
You mean "them."

248
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,332
When you say, "fail her,"
you mean, "fail them."

249
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,835

He's gonna need an
embolectomy. Call Hahn back here.

254
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,232
A clot in the right
pulmonary artery.

255
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,656
I could get to it.

256
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:46,724
- Hahn will assess him.
- I can get to it.

257
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,894
The lung retracts, leaving
the area for embolectomy clear.

258
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,997
He's already severely
compromised. We'd waste time,

259
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,799
time his brain
won't be perfusing.

260
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,467
It'll take me seconds.

261
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,170
I've done it before. With Burke.

262
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,607
I promised this kid he'd live.

263

Yang would be the best
person to open him up?

281
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,941
- She's a cardiac savant.
- Is that why she went through

282
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:13,378
- the fourth intercostal space?
- Couldn't get in through fifth.

283
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,613
Gauze pushing the diaphragm up.

284
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,882
This could be
easier under fluoro.

285
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:20,062
Already had the
TEE. I'm doing fine.

286
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,520
Reach it better...
Forget it. I'll do it.

287
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,166
- Gown, please.
- I've got this.

288
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,310

00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,843
Shepherd scheduled
two craniotomies

292
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,478
for the clinical trial today?

293
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,049
- Yes, we lost the first one...
- I told Meredith one patient.

294
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:53,195
Dr. Grey said she
cleared it with you.

295
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,651
Did she?

296
00:15:55,888 --> 00:16:01,626
- I... Sir, I might be mistaken.
- I don't think you are.

297
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:10,100
- She's holding steady.
- The ICP's 13.

298
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:13,237
- We'll see.
- Derek.

299
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,308
She's still alive.
We've gotten this far.

300
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,345
- She's still alive.
- For how long?

301
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,914
- You can go.
- I'll stay with her.

302
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:28,152
No, it's just... I'll
do it. You can go.

303
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,673
Yang flew solo,

304
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,142
and you should be
celebrating because that means

305
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:52,710
you're doing your job.

306
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:55,212
Teaching her how to save a life.

307
00:16:56,582 --> 00:17:01,085
Residents are like puppies,
eager and enthusiastic,

308
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,688
and you need to learn how to
teach without crushing their spirit.

309
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,726
Now you want to work
here with my residents,

310
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:13,130
then you need to do better.
You need to be a better teacher.

311
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,147
Don't make me
regret backing you up.

312
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,983
No, sir. Absolutely not, sir.

313
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:36,821
- Thank you, sir.
- Puppies.

314
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,095
Rebecca.

315
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:48,299
This is Dr. Shapiro from Psych.
He's gonna be examining you.

316
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,669
- Iz...
- Ask questions while Karev and I talk.

317
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,050
- What did I tell you?
- She's my patient.

318
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:09,553
I decide her treatment. I am not
releasing her without a consult.

319
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:13,057
If you try to take her without
my OK, I will have you arrested.

320
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,025
- You can't have me arrested.
- Try me.

321
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:18,696
Look, Iz, you're worried. I
see that, and I understand.

322
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:21,065
But you're being a
little unreasonable.

323
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:24,701
- I've got this.
- No, you don't have it. I have it.

324
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:27,771
- I'm taking her home.
- No. No!

325
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,608
- You gonna bodily restrain me?
- I will if I have to.

326
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,287
- Hit a woman?
- If I have to.

327
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:36,214
Alex, she's sick. She needs
help you cannot possibly give her.

328
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,549
- I can take care of her.
- No, you can't.

329
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:41,718
You have no idea. You could
do damage by taking her home.

330
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:44,033
I can take care of her.
I've done this before.

331
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:46,791
- Alex...
- She's just going through
a bad patch.

332
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,293
People go through a
bad patch. All right?

333
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,729
I can feed her and I
can... I can change her,

334
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,842
and I can bathe her
and I can watch her.

335
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,265
Until the bad patch is over,

336
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,167
I can take care of her.

337
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,137
I took care of my mom,
and I can take care of her.

338
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,275
- You've done this before.
- I've done this before.

339
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,410
I have done this before, Izzie.

340
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,946
But I was a kid then,
and I'm a man now,

341
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:10,447
so I'll be better at it.

342
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,017
- I have done this before.
- Stop.

343
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,053
You don't have to say anymore.

344
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,404
- You're here early.
- I never went home.

345
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,384
You'd want to
monitor your patient.

346
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,174
I figured you were tired.

347
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:14,378
- How is he?
- His vitals are stable.

348
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,920
He received 16 liters
over the first 24 hours.

349
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:20,151
I changed it down
to 125 cc's per hour.

350
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:22,431
Urine output's at
37 cc's per hour.

351
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:25,656
He had some anxiety at
3am, and then again at 5am,

352
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,803
which I treated with
diphenhydramine.

353
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:32,095
- Good. Good job.
- It's not a good job.

354
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:39,237
- O'Malley?
- It's not a good job for me.

355
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:42,973
Sitting by his bedside
recording urine output

356
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,443
and giving antianxiety
meds all night.

357
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:47,945
It's not a good job for me.

358
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:51,181
Running labs for Meredith
Grey, that's not a good job for me.

359
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,817
It's not a good job
because I'm better than that,

360
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,931
and you know I'm
better than that.

361
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,155
Maybe if I wasn't good at my job

362
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:02,759
or maybe if I had struggled
and was lagging behind...

363
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:07,864
My personality, I'm not Karev,
I'm not Yang, I'm not Meredith.

364
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,702
I'm not hardened,
I get that. I get it.

365
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:14,938
I don't have the
personality of a surgeon.

366
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,508
Maybe that's why
you made the mistake

367
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,710
of not thinking that I
deserve a second chance

368
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:23,280
when everyone else
around here has gotten one.

369
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:26,917
But, sir, it is a mistake
because I'm excellent.

370
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:30,121
I'm excellent at my job.
And I did fail my test,

371
00:21:30,223 --> 00:21:33,457
but I deserve a second chance.

372
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:40,731
OK.

373
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:46,904
- OK?
- OK, you can retake the test.

374
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:54,378
OK.

375
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,148
She hasn't woken up yet.

376
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,817
Sometimes it takes
longer with brain surgery

377
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,452
for the body to recover.

378
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,889
But she could not wake up?

379
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,093
- Could she die?
- That's a possibility,

380
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:11,795
but I'd rather not worry
about that until we have to.

381
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:15,666
- When?
- When what?

382
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:19,336
When will we have to
start worrying about that?

383
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,016
Still here. Sleep in
the waiting room?

384
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,785
Look, I like him.

385
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:37,354
All right, I do. But he
doesn't need to know that.

386
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,890
- Nobody needs to know that.
- He needs you,

387
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:41,925
and you're worried
about your friends?

388
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,105
What do you know?

389
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:44,539
Do you know what
it'd be like for me,

390
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:48,064
for him, if they
knew? Think it's easy?

391
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:51,969
I think it's better
to be honest.

392
00:22:55,207 --> 00:23:00,377
He's alive. Barely,
but... he's alive.

393
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,753
I, uh, called your husband.

394
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,391
He says he took the baby
and left you two months ago.

395
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:19,129
He says...

396
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,642
You have something called underlying
borderline personality disorder,

397
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:35,780
which means you were
fragile to start with, so this...

398
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:38,983
This has probably been
coming on for a while.

399
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,520
Probably since
your... your accident.

400
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:44,555
Then they changed your face.

401
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:48,325
I helped change your face.

402
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,429
You couldn't...

403
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,368
You need help, Rebecca,
and I can't give it to you.

404
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:06,577
So you're gonna stay here
tonight, and tomorrow...

405
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:12,683
Tomorrow, they're gonna
transfer you to a psychiatric facility.

406
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,519
I think that's better.

407
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,390
I'm sorry.

408
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,030
I really tried.

409
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:31,234
I wanted to be better for you.

410
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,673
I know how hard it is
for you to trust people,

411
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,643
and I wanted to be someone
you could depend on.

412
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,280
I'm sorry.

413
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,950
I'm sorry.

414
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:52,789
It's OK. You tried.

415
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:01,064
So you convinced Shepherd
to do the second surgery

416
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,166
without my approval.

417
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,834
- So?
- So?

418
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,539
That's how you speak
to the chief, "So?"

419
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:13,109
My mother tried to kill
herself after you left.

420
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:14,978
Did you know that?

421
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:21,285
- Did you know that?
- I didn't know that.

422
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:25,288
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- She was a brilliant surgeon.

423
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,992
How could you do that to her?

424
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:33,864
She was a talented, gifted,
extraordinary surgeon.

425
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,369
Meredith?

426
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,381
- Tell me.
- She was a surgeon.

427
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,416
An excellent surgeon.

428
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:54,162
If she was really
trying to kill herself,

429
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,720
she wouldn't have slit her
wrists. She knew better.

430
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:59,623
She would've taken the
scalpel, cut her carotid artery.

431
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,893
Would've taken seconds to
die. She didn't really want to die.

432
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:05,930
She was an excellent,
gifted, extraordinary surgeon.

433
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:08,398
- Didn't want to die.
- What did she want?

434
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,345
She wanted Richard to come back.

435
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:11,868
And why didn't he come back?

436
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,338
Well, because he
never knew about it,

437
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,251
and she was too stubborn to ask.

438
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:20,477
- What does that mean?
- Well, that part I don't know.

439
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,419
Could you tell me
that part for once?

440
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,315
I can.

441
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:27,151
It means that you are a gifted,

442
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:30,554
talented, extraordinary
surgeon, exactly like your mother,

443
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:34,992
but the difference is you get
to learn from her mistakes.

444
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:41,064
Be extraordinary.

445
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:44,835
She wasn't talking
about surgery.

446
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,404
No, she wasn't.

447
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:52,542
She wasn't talking
about surgery at all.

448
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:07,157
Well, do I or do I not
keep my promises?

449
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,929
You do.

450
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:15,766
And remember what I said
about the bigger picture?

451
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:17,801
Yeah.

452
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:49,500
He's been waiting his
whole life for that, huh?

453
00:27:49,602 --> 00:27:51,268
Yes, he has.

454
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,711
- Are those Beth's films?
- Yes.

455
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,814
These are from two days
ago, and these are from today.

456
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,884
Would you hand me
the calipers, please?

457
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,594
This one is smaller than that
one. The tumor's shrinking.

458
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,730
- The virus is working.
- Oh, my God.

459
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:26,003
- You have to go tell Derek.
- No. You have to tell Derek.

460
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:28,872
It's the kind of news he'd
want to hear from you.

461
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,743
Rose.

462
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:36,313
Congratulations on your
major medical breakthrough.

463
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:38,948
It's the stuff of legends.

464
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:48,125
- Hey!
- Take the sparkle pager back.

465
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,827
- I am drunk on the power.
- Where is it?

466
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,707
I think it might
actually be mystical.

467
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,498
- Have you seen Derek?
- Nope.

468
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,870
Um... You paged, Dr. Yang?

469
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:02,705
Grab that banana from my cubby.

470
00:29:06,312 --> 00:29:09,012
You... You want
me to peel it for you?

471
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:12,048
I want you to learn running
whip stitch. I'll teach it.

472
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,751
Take the needle.

473
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:16,431
- Chart.
- Here you go.

474
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:18,355
Thank you.

475
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,075
Hi.

476
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:44,881
Hey.

477
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:47,784
You're alive.

478
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,390
Yeah. I'm alive.

479
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,671
Not just for show anymore.

480
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:11,708
No.

481
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,225
That's not sanitary.

482
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:33,797
A little closer
together. Try again.

483
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:36,132
- Dr. Yang, thank you for...
- Uh-huh.

484
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,208
How'd it go?

485
00:30:47,146 --> 00:30:50,414
- Awful.
- Yeah.

486
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:58,755
OK. Um...

487
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,524
These are for you.

488
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,438
Why give me your
keys to the clinic?

489
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:05,162
I'm not giving you
my keys to the clinic.

490
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:07,164
I'm giving you the clinic.

491
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:09,299
What?

492
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:13,169
I've seen the bigger
picture. I love the clinic.

493
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,739
I love what it means,
I love what it is.

494
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:18,308
But I don't love it as
much as I love surgery.

495
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:22,245
I don't love it as much as
I love being chief resident.

496
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:26,516
I don't love it as much as I
love my husband and my child.

497
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,118
I have seen the bigger picture,

498
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,957
and I can't do everything
and still have everything.

499
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:39,195
So I have to... let
some pieces go.

500
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:44,501
This piece. This is your piece.

501
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:48,171
I've watched you earn this piece

502
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:51,341
the hard way, the awful way.

503
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:57,046
Knowing that I can give the
clinic to someone like you.

504
00:31:57,148 --> 00:32:03,319
You have grown into a
fine doctor, Izzie Stevens.

505
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,592
Thank you.

506
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:20,203
The Denny Duquette
Memorial Clinic is in your hands.

507
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,938
You make me proud.

508
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:32,548
<i>- ♪ Yeah ♪</i>
- Derek!

509
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:34,550
