This is Mary. She
lost consciousness.

How's Shane? My partner?

4
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:09,707
I didn't want her to see.
She might take offense.

5
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,227
- Can you get my wife?
- Baby?

6
00:00:12,329 --> 00:00:14,462

Can you sneak me in?

00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,137
You're busted.

11
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:26,291
Gonna tell him. Don't want
him seeing other people.

00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:30,328
- What?
- Nothing. I'm gonna be late.

13
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,113
We need to talk.

14
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:35,450

OK. OK, that's it. I got
it. It stopped. I got it.

54
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:44,712
Holy crap. My artery blew.

55
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:47,699
- Your artery blew.
- I didn't think that'd happen.

56
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,301
Thought it was something
they say might happen

57
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:53,238
because they have to,
but didn't think it'd happen.

58
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,906
Me neither.

59
00:03:00,998 --> 00:03:03,915
- Their local tech's in Spokane.
- That's five hours away.

60
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,017
Tell them I was in
somebody's brain?

61
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,064
Yes. The tech is
still in Spokane.

62
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:11,423
You can't just pull the probes
out and go to a full craniotomy?

63
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:15,977
- No. Why not?
- The probe is in the tumors.

64
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,480
Pulling out without navigation
system could damage brain tissue.

65
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:21,828
Can't leave the probe
in without swelling.

66
00:03:21,852 --> 00:03:23,092
Good. What's your name?

67
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:25,737
Two. Steve! Steve Mostow.

68
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,540
- Dr. Steve Mostow. Intern.
- Hi, Steve.

69
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:31,126
Run to the nurses.
Make an announcement.

70
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:33,428
We need computer
technicians in OR Three.

71
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,564
- Go fast and scrub in.
- Yes, sir.

72
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,449
- Dr. Shepherd?
- Yes.

73
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,318
I did three semesters in
computer science before nursing.

74
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:46,324
I don't know what's wrong, but if
it's something reasonably basic, I...

75
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,927
I'd feel better if your
voice wasn't shaking.

76
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,229
Shakes when I'm
nervous. I'm imperfect.

77
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,930
It doesn't mean I can't fix it.

78
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:56,118
Rose has semesters of
computer science at what school?

79
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,069
- Santa Cruz.
- That's a party school.

80
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:01,439
Insult my education or want
me to help you save your patient?

81
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,741
Who can beat three semesters

82
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,977
of computer science at
Santa Cruz? Anybody?

83
00:04:08,364 --> 00:04:12,417
- OK. Give it a shot.
- I appreciate the vote
of confidence.

84
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,055
Can you see anything yet?

85
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:21,192
Uh, I see the diaphragm
moving. Move it up a little more.

86
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:23,561
- Meredith?
- I'm working on it!

87
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,348
You're not doing
a very good job.

88
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,968
I am doing a damn
fine job. Don't you worry.

89
00:04:31,922 --> 00:04:34,455
Can you... Can
you close his eyes?

90
00:04:34,557 --> 00:04:39,627
- What?
- Stan. Can you close his eyes?

91
00:04:41,464 --> 00:04:44,399
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

92
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:51,506
Stop. Stop right there. I
want to freeze that frame.

93
00:04:51,608 --> 00:04:53,770
Yeah, his pericardium's
full of blood.

94
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,994
That's not good.
That's not good at all.

95
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:59,564
Oxygen, IV start
kits. Arnie, monitor.

96
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,402
You, pericardiocentesis kit.
His anatomy's all screwed up

97
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:06,988
because he's hanging upside
down. Get someone from cardio!

98
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:12,927
I've got Tucker waiting
for me and I'm late.

99
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:16,198
Do me a favor and take the
patient through to post-op.

100
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,150
- What?
- OK, I wanted to say

101
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,604
- when you took me
off Hahn's service...
- Something's wrong.

102
00:05:22,706 --> 00:05:26,708
- Blood pressure's bottomed out.
- I'll hang it. Here.

103
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,277
- Dr. Bailey!
- O'Malley...

104
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:33,581
OK. Need you to talk to Tucker.
I need you to ask him to wait.

105
00:05:33,683 --> 00:05:36,534
He's not going to be
inclined to, so ask him nicely.

106
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:39,871
Can you please go and
ask him nicely to wait?

107
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:41,676
- Yes, ma'am.
- I won't be long.

108
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:45,510
Do you see this, Stevens?
Sternum's cleaned out.

109
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,423
Which means we're
almost out of here.

110
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,214
Don't want to watch me work?

111
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:51,694
It's offensive,
Dr. Sloan. Flat out.

112
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,435
I asked if you wanted to
watch me work. Offensive?

113
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:57,972
Play dumb? Does that work for
you because of the way you look?

114
00:05:58,074 --> 00:06:00,914
- What are you talking about?
- If you were homely,

115
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:03,979
you would have lost
your job a long time ago.

116
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,964
The chief needs you
in the ambulance bay.

117
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,778
Paramedic with
cardiac tamponade.

118
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:12,036
Alrighty then.
Let's go, Stevens.

119
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,789
OK, um...

120
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:18,092
Nick, can you reach
your call button?

121
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:20,628
- I think so.
- No, no! Don't move that much!

122
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,431
OK.

123
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:25,584
Uh... just...

124
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:30,555
Can you reach your phone?
Without moving very much.

125
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,623
I think so. I got it.

126
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,837
OK. Good. Good, good, good.

127
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:39,464
OK, dial eight, OK? OK.

128
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,767
- Is that eight?
- OK. OK.

129
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:43,384
Put it to my ear, OK?

130
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,237
- <i>Nurses Station.</i>
- Hi.

131
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,389
Hi, this is Dr. Grey.

132
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,731
Mr. Hanscomb's
carotid just blew and...

133
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:55,997
Can you page Dr. Sloan for
me please? And also Dr. Yang?

134
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:59,684
I'm gonna go ahead and call
this a code blue. Yes. Code blue.

135
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,186
Can you announce
that please? Thank you.

136
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:05,539
- You can put it down.
- Code blue. That means I'm dead, right?

137
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:08,710
That's what they call when
people go, like, flatline.

138
00:07:08,812 --> 00:07:11,412
I figure we can use
all the help we can get.

139
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,277
I don't care who it is. I
don't care who it is, Jolene.

140
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,574
I am leaving when I am finished.

141
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:31,249
If the patient is on fire,
I'm not scrubbing in.

142
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,868
It's Dr. Yang's. Lexie
Grey is paging you 911.

143
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,738
Your intern called a code
blue on a patient who's not.

144
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,241
What? Why would
she call a code if...

145
00:07:40,343 --> 00:07:41,623
Go find out.

146
00:07:41,677 --> 00:07:44,929
You needed me here. That's
why you pulled me off of cardio.

147
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,882
No, I'm fine. Go
kick some intern butt.

148
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,873
- How you doing, Dr. Grey?
- Lexie. I'm OK. Are you OK?

149
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,575
I'm a little freaked
out, if I'm being honest.

150
00:07:57,678 --> 00:08:00,344
Mostly because you look
like Carrie at the prom.

151
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,982
- You're wearing half my blood.
- Why we're hanging more.

152
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:06,534
- Having trouble getting a vein.
- Why?

153
00:08:06,637 --> 00:08:08,403
Hypovolemic. Is
veins are flaccid.

154
00:08:08,505 --> 00:08:10,155
That's not a nice thing to say.

155
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,140
That's not a nice
thing to say at all.

156
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,108
Ow! Ow!

157
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,050
- Son of a bitch!
- It's OK! It's OK!

158
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,663
- It's OK!
- Stop the bleeding!

159
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:23,100
- My hand slipped. I got it.
- That can't happen anymore.

160
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:26,487
- That can't happen anymore.
- Apply steady, firm pressure.

161
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,107
I called for Sloan. Should
we take him to an OR?

162
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:32,527
No, there's no OR. I
was just down there.

163
00:08:34,331 --> 00:08:37,398
Tyler? You should run and get
more blood. Just in case, OK?

164
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:40,218
- Apply pressure. I'll get Sloan.
- Leaving?

165
00:08:40,303 --> 00:08:43,054
I'll be right back.
You're doing this.

166
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:50,078
You seeing this? How I'm
tightening the cable by hand?

167
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,080
Yeah.

168
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,151
- That's my face.
- What?

169
00:08:56,253 --> 00:08:58,987
In the gallery. I built that
face. That's Jane Doe.

170
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:02,140
The one with the
amnesia. She a surgeon?

171
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:05,209
- Uh, I don't...
- You are so busted.

172
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,295
Nick Hanscomb's carotid blew.

173
00:09:07,397 --> 00:09:10,332
Karev, irrigate thoroughly,
finish up, pack the wound.

174
00:09:10,434 --> 00:09:12,366
- Leaving?
- Other guy can't survive.

175
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,102
- There's no OR available.
- This one will be.

176
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:19,541
Get this room turned around ASAP.
I'm bringing down my carotid bleed.

177
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:25,030
Tucker! Hey.

178
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:27,665
She's busy, right?
She can't make lunch?

179
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,618
She can make a slightly
later lunch. She's in surgery.

180
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,821
- Always is.
- Taking a little longer.

181
00:09:32,923 --> 00:09:34,472
Always does.

182
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:37,025
She's having a really bad day.

183
00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:40,045
She's saving the life
of a white supremacist,

184
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:42,697
which is not a good day.
So she asked me to ask you

185
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,733
if you wouldn't mind
waiting a little while longer.

186
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,503
Please? She did said please.

187
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:53,758
Which, as you may know, is not
a word she uses that frequently.

188
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,394
She really is sorry. It
shouldn't be much longer.

189
00:09:56,496 --> 00:10:01,566
Fine. Tell Miranda I said don't
keep me waiting long. Please.

190
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,351
OK.

191
00:10:05,388 --> 00:10:07,555
Lucy.

192
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,429
If it's all right, I'll update
Mr. Nolston's family

193
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,797
and meet you in
the ambulance bay.

194
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:22,002
He's your patient. Keep
the family informed?

195
00:10:22,105 --> 00:10:25,423
Think like a surgeon. You're
thinking like a social worker.

196
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:28,392
If you want to be a social
worker, save yourself effort

197
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,729
because the training
is two years, not 12.

198
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:34,081
Want to be a surgeon,
you can update the family

199
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:35,950
when the crisis has passed.

200
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,537
You're right.
Absolutely. I'm sorry. I...

201
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,689
- Steve.
- Yes, sir?

202
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,197
- Did you bring
anybody with you?
- No.

203
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:52,200
The nurses made an
announcement. I waited, no one came.

204
00:10:52,302 --> 00:10:54,819
- Rose?
- Damn. Damn it. Damn it.

205
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,288
- Rose?
- I don't have
the steadiest hand.

206
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,008
I need to reconnect wires, and
when you talk to me, it is less steady.

207
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,761
- It's about the wires?
- I think so. I'm pretty sure.

208
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,646
- I'll do it.
- What?

209
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,749
I'll do it. You don't
have steady hands.

210
00:11:07,851 --> 00:11:09,650
- Because I'm nervous.
- Got that.

211
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,035
Let me take care of the wires.

212
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,170
I'm a neurosurgeon.
Steady hands.

213
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,390
You're holding the
leads in the brain.

214
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:18,293
OK. Steve, how's
your hand? Is it steady?

215
00:11:18,395 --> 00:11:20,261
- Hell, yes, sir.
- Better be,

216
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:23,364
or you kill my patient. I
need you to hold this very still.

217
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:26,550
- Yes, sir.
- Very, very still. Good.

218
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:33,191
Sterile sleeves, gloves,
please. Tell me what I got to do.

219
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:37,545
- You talked to Tucker?
- Yes.

220
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:39,597
As long as you're
out soon, he'll wait.

221
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,767
Mother of... The
hepatic vein was injured.

222
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,686
- Can you check
for a new murmur?
- Checking now.

223
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,989
O'Malley, go talk to Tucker.

224
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:50,336
Just ask him to
wait a little longer.

225
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,793
- I just scrubbed in.
- O'Malley, ask him!

226
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:54,746
Yes, ma'am.

227
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:10,428
A person can only rise so high.

228
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,831
I'm rising above, but there's
a ceiling and I'm about to hit it!

229
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:18,302
Let me guess, air embolus?

230
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,676
We're about to start
the pericardiocentesis,

231
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:29,747
but with the position of his body, the
blood won't be pooled to the heart...

232
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:32,983
I'd still use the subxiphoid
rather than the parasternal.

233
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,464
Right. OK. Meredith,
did you hear that?

234
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:39,874
- Yeah. Is the kit ready yet?
- Getting it ready for you now.

235
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:42,821
How you doing, Ray?

236
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,207
You've got to be careful
with this technique.

237
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,092
If you aim the
needle incorrectly,

238
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:50,068
you could nick the very
thin-walled right atrium.

239
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,346
Cause a cardiac rupture.

240
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,454
Rupture, a tension pneumothorax.

241
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:56,391
There's about six different
ways she could kill him.

242
00:12:56,493 --> 00:13:00,228
- Are they talking about me?
- No. Don't listen to them, Ray.

243
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,096
Dr. Hahn?

244
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,447
Shut up.

245
00:13:07,436 --> 00:13:10,571
Sir, you're gonna be fine.

246
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:13,074
Stevens, go get me
an 18-gauge needle

247
00:13:13,176 --> 00:13:15,076
before this man's
heart explodes.

248
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:16,593
Got it.

249
00:13:24,353 --> 00:13:26,905
- How you doing, Karev?
- Yeah, good. I'm fine.

250
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:30,041
My nose itches.
Itches like crazy.

251
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,111
That's the anxiety. Can't
scratch it, so it itches.

252
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:38,316
- Whoa! What did you do?
- I was irrigating.

253
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:39,851
I need more suction.

254
00:13:39,936 --> 00:13:41,819
Coming from the
side of his chest.

255
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,255
I think his heart's
starting to bleed.

256
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:47,074
Hang a unit of blood!
Page Hahn and Sloan now!

257
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:48,609
Right away.

258
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:55,683
Tyler, could you get
me more gauze, please?

259
00:13:55,785 --> 00:13:58,285
Why do you need more
gauze? 'Cause I'm bleeding?

260
00:13:58,387 --> 00:14:01,456
- I'm still bleeding?
- We have blood going in, too.

261
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:03,758
Is it going in as
fast as it's going out?

262
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,713
I'm asking because I'm starting
to feel, like, queasy. And weak.

263
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:11,282
Maybe like a person
who's losing a lot of blood.

264
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:14,602
OK, I'm transferring
now, Nick. You ready?

265
00:14:14,704 --> 00:14:15,836
Yeah.

266
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:21,276
Lexie? Should I
be calling people?

267
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:23,645
Should I be calling my
family or somebody?

268
00:14:23,747 --> 00:14:27,415
I think... I think the
bleeding's stopped.

269
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:31,151
- How you doing, Nick?
- Dr. Sloan. It's Dr. Sloan.

270
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:33,187
- I think the bleeding stopped.
- You OK?

271
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,425
- Do I look OK?
- Actually, you do.

272
00:14:37,526 --> 00:14:41,078
- You've got
bleeding under control.
- Why would it stop?

273
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,048
The herald bleed, which
means there's a possibility

274
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,567
- of it bleeding.
- I'm gonna get it closed up.

275
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:49,703
- There's no OR.
- There will be in ten minutes.

276
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,417
Get a pressure
dressing on this wound.

277
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:53,635
Get him prepped
straight to OR Three.

278
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,293
Make sure it's cleared
out. Good work, Grey.

279
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,528
Thank you.

280
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:01,032
Hey.

281
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:05,303
I'm in love with you now. I've
forgotten entirely about my ex.

282
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,444
- Come on! Are you kidding me?
- What?

283
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,880
I have a patient on
the table... I got to go.

284
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,216
- Erica!
- Page the cardio fellow,

285
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:21,685
then book an OR. Have it
waiting when they get him free.

286
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:32,846
Why am I not surprised?

287
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:35,349
Dr. Bailey is very sorry.
She's very, very sorry.

288
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:37,819
- I'm out of here.
- She just asked me to ask

289
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,238
if you could wait longer. She's
almost done with the surgery.

290
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:45,642
It's more complicated than
expected, but is almost done.

291
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,512
Fine, I'll wait. But
you tell her I'm tired

292
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,382
of her choosing everything
over our marriage.

293
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,933
The last time. I'm finished.

294
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:57,888
Tell her the only reason I'm
staying is to tell her myself.

295
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,258
- What the hell did you do?
- Nothing. I cut the cable.

296
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,095
You cut the cable? Showing
off for your girlfriend?

297
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,646
Any idea how screwed you are?

298
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:08,449
It's not his fault. I'm
holding this guy's coronary.

299
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,685
- Did somebody page Hahn?
- - What the hell happened?

300
00:16:11,788 --> 00:16:13,265
- Graft blew.
- Damn it!

301
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:16,256
- If you need me to...
- Need you to stay quiet.

302
00:16:16,358 --> 00:16:19,493
- Get more suction in here.
- Just hold onto that.

303
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,419
O'Malley?

304
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:31,389
- Your husband is waiting.
- Good.

305
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,508
- He's waiting and...
- Look, I heard you.

306
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:37,562
Why aren't you scrubbed
in? I could use a hand.

307
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:43,151
He said something about you
choosing everything over your marriage.

308
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,354
He said that?

309
00:16:46,456 --> 00:16:49,423
- What else did he say?
- I think that was about it.

310
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:51,075
You think or you know?

311
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:56,080
He said this was the last
time, and he was finished.

312
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,868
I'm in surgery, O'Malley.

313
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,504
Did you tell him that I'm
trying to save a man's life?

314
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,440
- Yes.
- That I want to be there

315
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,610
with him now, but if I were
to leave, this man would die?

316
00:17:09,712 --> 00:17:11,472
- Tell him that?
- Yeah. Yes.

317
00:17:11,514 --> 00:17:15,433
You need to go back out there
and tell him that I took a vow.

318
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,501
A vow to save lives.

319
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:20,904
Remember that he also took
a vow. For better or for worse.

320
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,657
You tell him that it's his job,

321
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,160
as a husband, to
understand that.

322
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:29,763
You tell him that I'm standing
by my vow. For better or worse.

323
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:31,577
Tell him I'm holding
him to his vow.

324
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:35,102
You tell him if he's thinking
about leaving right now,

325
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:38,138
that he might find
himself hurt and wounded

326
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,107
and needing an operation.

327
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:43,477
He may not get a surgeon who
is as married to her vows as I am.

328
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:45,312
You tell him that!

329
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,384
- Can I just go do some charts?
- Go!

330
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,711
- It's in.
- It's in?

331
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,446
The wire's in.

332
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:07,919
- Steve, are you still?
- Yes, sir. Very still.

333
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,103
Stop looking at me
like I killed your patient.

334
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:15,526
I am not a technician.

335
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,255
- I did my best.
- You didn't.

336
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:19,074
Yes, I did do my best, damn it!

337
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,199
Calm down. Take a
deep breath and think.

338
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:24,535
What did you miss?
What are you forgetting?

339
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:36,880
- You forgot the restart button?
- I forgot to press restart.

340
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,949
Yeah, working. It's working.

341
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,735
It's working. It's working.

342
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:44,288
Santa Cruz is not
just a party school.

343
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,157
- Dr. Shepherd?
- Yes?

344
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,925
Your sleeves.

345
00:18:53,449 --> 00:18:56,683
This was never my
plan. To die this way.

346
00:18:56,786 --> 00:19:00,204
- You're not dying, Nick.
- - You're going to the OR.

347
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:03,307
I know. That's what I'm saying.

348
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:07,861
I think we kind of have
some say. Or at least a feeling.

349
00:19:07,963 --> 00:19:13,251
But I never had that
feeling, so I can't die, right?

350
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:20,141
I don't feel good. I feel...

351
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:23,276
- Oh! Nick? Nick?
- Can you squeeze my hand?

352
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:26,263
- Oh, my God! What happened?
- The blood to his brain...

353
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,732
It looks like he had
a stroke. Let's go.

354
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,051
Let's move him
carefully. Let's go.

355
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:36,323
You can't cry, Lexie. This
isn't over. You can't cry.

356
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,900
Hey, you need to find the
xiphoid process. You feel it?

357
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:51,422
- Got it.
- Go two finger breadths
to the left

358
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,258
- of the xiphoid.
- I'm there.

359
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:57,027
Here.

360
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,498
- Eighteen-gauge.
- Yeah.

361
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,584
- That is a very big needle.
- I know. I'm sorry.

362
00:20:04,687 --> 00:20:08,205
Angle the needle toward
the left shoulder. Don't stab.

363
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,652
Don't hit the ventricle,
don't drop the lung.

364
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,404
That wouldn't
help matters either.

365
00:20:12,428 --> 00:20:14,562
I changed my mind. I want out.

366
00:20:14,664 --> 00:20:18,098
This is gonna help you, Ray.
I'm gonna go on three, OK?

367
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,051
- One, two...
- No, wait.

368
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:25,506
Tell Stan's wife I'm sorry.
Tell Sara I'm sorry about Stan.

369
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:29,576
Tell her yourself. One, two...

370
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,812
Wait. Wait.

371
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:33,663
We're running out of time.

372
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,415
- Just wait.
- OK.

373
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:38,418
- What's taking so long?
- He's not ready.

374
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:41,571
I'm trying not to be scared.
I don't want to die scared.

375
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:45,876
- I want to not be scared.
- Ray, listen to me.

376
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,412
It's good to be scared.

377
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:51,215
It means you still
have something to lose.

378
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:56,971
Yeah? Are you scared?

379
00:20:58,908 --> 00:21:00,674
All the time.

380
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,297
OK. That's good.

381
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,499
OK, I'm ready.

382
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:12,569
But don't count. Just do
it. Do it so I don't know it's...

383
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,844
The infection went to his heart.

384
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,046
His hack of a surgeon
didn't check grafts.

385
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:25,749
Should've caught it.
Should've checked. I missed.

386
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:29,487
Damn it, how did I miss
it? Stupid, stupid, stupid.

387
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,922
- That's fascinating.
- What?

388
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,775
You're as unkind to yourself
as you are to everyone.

389
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,543
Sloan.

390
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:41,915
Dr. Sloan, his artery blew and he
appears to be having a left-sided CVA.

391
00:21:42,017 --> 00:21:44,435
- Where is he?
- You told me bring him here.

392
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:50,040
- Hahn, you close?
- No.

393
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,326
Yang, get him to a sterile
procedure room. Run!

394
00:21:52,428 --> 00:21:55,629
- Let's go.
- I can help. What do you want me to do?

395
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,647
Anesthesiologist,
nurse, equipment.

396
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:00,233
I'm on it. Stay with Hahn.

397
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:07,992
This man has four children.
He has four children.

398
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:14,509
I feel like I'm
going in too far.

399
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:15,983
Pull back! Pull back!

400
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,852
- Pull back! Pull back!
- Chief, what am I doing?

401
00:22:18,955 --> 00:22:23,123
Too far in. There's some ST
elevation. Try angling more forward.

402
00:22:26,662 --> 00:22:30,914
I got it! I got it! Ray?

403
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,853
That feels good. I can breathe.

404
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:38,422
He's almost stable!
Get ready to cut him out!

405
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:41,308
All right. All right.

406
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:45,395
We're gonna get you out of here.
We're getting you out right now.

407
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,867
- You're bleeding.
- It's Ray's blood.

408
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:51,802
I can see that.

409
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,477
It could use a
couple of stitches.

410
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:02,580
But you stayed calm and focused

411
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:05,666
and efficient in a
very stressful situation.

412
00:23:05,768 --> 00:23:07,868
That's impressive.

413
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,071
I was scared.

414
00:23:11,174 --> 00:23:15,642
You did it anyway.
Like I said, impressive.

415
00:23:23,085 --> 00:23:25,418
Do not tell me that
there isn't an OR.

416
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,371
This is for the chief. A
paramedic's life is on the line.

417
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:30,975
- You need to find one now.
- I'll see where we are.

418
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,077
Dr. Stevens? Thank
God. How is he?

419
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:37,731
I... I believe he's
still in surgery.

420
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,067
- But I don't know.
- You don't know?

421
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,685
Why don't you...?

422
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,988
You said that you were
gonna keep me informed...

423
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:46,639
I'm sorry. I'm on another case,
but I was gonna check back...

424
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,093
- You're on another case?
- I'm sorry.

425
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:53,997
I have four kids. Four
terrified children who think that

426
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,617
their dad's gonna die.
Did you have instructors

427
00:23:56,719 --> 00:23:58,730
who didn't teach you
how to be a doctor,

428
00:23:58,754 --> 00:24:03,323
or bad parents who didn't teach
you how to be a decent human?

429
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:07,311
- OR Two is clearing out now.
- Thank you.

430
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:10,597
My husband, Jacob Nolston,
went into surgery hours ago.

431
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,017
Please find someone who
can tell me if he's dead or alive?

432
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,505
- She said that?
- If you could wait
a few more minutes,

433
00:24:18,608 --> 00:24:20,051
you guys can talk to each other.

434
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:22,560
Because things
get lost in translation

435
00:24:22,662 --> 00:24:25,378
because this is clearly
not a way to have what is

436
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,326
a very, very important
conversation.

437
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,733
It's clearly not very important.

438
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:32,486
Our marriage is falling
apart and she sends you.

439
00:24:32,588 --> 00:24:37,857
Tucker. She's in surgery.

440
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,111
She's literally saving a life
and she's gonna be here soon.

441
00:24:41,214 --> 00:24:42,958
She's always
saving a person's life.

442
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,049
She'll always be here soon.

443
00:24:45,134 --> 00:24:48,969
You go ask her, when
exactly is soon gonna come?

444
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:05,535
Excuse me. You're... You're
the one who came to get me.

445
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:09,423
- Who told me about Stan.
- Yes.

446
00:25:09,525 --> 00:25:12,693
- Is Ray...?
- He's in surgery.

447
00:25:13,996 --> 00:25:16,463
OK. I have to go.

448
00:25:16,565 --> 00:25:19,399
I have to get out of here, so...

449
00:25:21,037 --> 00:25:24,988
Look, can you tell
him that I'm sorry?

450
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:27,975
I can't stay here? I just can't
come back here right now?

451
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:31,644
Ray wanted me to tell
you that he's sorry too.

452
00:25:31,746 --> 00:25:33,992
He's sorry he
couldn't save Stan.

453
00:25:34,016 --> 00:25:37,234
He wanted me to tell you
that in case he didn't make it.

454
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:43,873
- Think he's not gonna make it?
- I hope he makes it.

455
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:45,942
But you won't be here, so...

456
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:50,614
My husband is dead.

457
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:55,819
He's dead. Somewhere
in this hospital.

458
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:59,289
How am I supposed to stay here?

00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:39,146
It looks a little jagged.

Does it look jagged to

00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:32,409
His heart was severely damaged.
And his lungs were compromised.

497
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:36,413
But he's young and strong
and our hope is that he'll be fine.

498
00:28:52,781 --> 00:28:54,514
Ray?

499
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:58,401
Ray?

500
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:02,856
I'm here.

501
00:29:14,236 --> 00:29:16,837
Well, your liver had more
damage than we saw on the CT

502
00:29:16,939 --> 00:29:19,472
and then we found a
perforation in your bowel.

503
00:29:19,574 --> 00:29:23,143
But we took care of it all, and
you should have a full recovery.

504
00:29:23,245 --> 00:29:25,462
Not a full recovery.

505
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:31,084
Dr. Bail... She did
this on purpose, right?

506
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,271
I don't understand. You
have a black partner, right?

507
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:36,240
- Yeah.
- Mary?

508
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:39,393
Yeah. Do you know how she is?

509
00:29:39,495 --> 00:29:41,128
Are you two are friends?

510
00:29:42,598 --> 00:29:45,949
Look, I'm not the devil, OK?

511
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:49,069
I'm just a guy with
a belief system.

512
00:29:49,171 --> 00:29:50,887
Mary's a nice girl.

513
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,839
We save lives together.
That's a good time.

514
00:29:52,941 --> 00:29:56,310
If she wanted to marry my
brother, I'd have a problem with that.

515
00:29:56,412 --> 00:29:59,213
But so would a lot of people.

516
00:29:59,315 --> 00:30:03,133
I'm not that much different than
most of the people you know.

517
00:30:04,987 --> 00:30:07,721
Well, Dr. Bailey did
save your life today.

518
00:30:07,823 --> 00:30:11,057
A black woman saved your
life at a great personal cost.

519
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:14,394
Next time you're looking at
your tattoo and you're thinking

520
00:30:14,496 --> 00:30:17,864
how much better white guys are
than everyone, think about that.

521
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:21,919
Because between you and me?
If I had been alone in that OR,

522
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:23,765
you'd probably
be dead right now.

523
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:26,723
And, since we're
sharing belief systems,

524
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:31,111
I believe if you were dead, the
world would be a better place.

525
00:30:42,724 --> 00:30:44,757
How's he doing?

526
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:47,060
He's OK. Surgery
was pretty hairy.

527
00:30:47,162 --> 00:30:49,229
He blew a graft
when we were closing.

528
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:52,799
- But he's starting to rally.
- Good. That's good.

529
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:57,554
- What are you doing here?
- I was just checking...

530
00:30:57,656 --> 00:31:00,173
We did fine without
your help. Do you mind?

531
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:21,144
You're not heading home?

532
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:25,682
Just easier, at this point, to
stay here until Tucker's asleep.

533
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:31,271
You know, I rose
above too today.

534
00:31:31,373 --> 00:31:33,607
- Yes, you did.
- You were having a hard day.

535
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:37,377
You were busy rising
above. But so was I.

536
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,646
Which is why I
haven't said anything.

537
00:31:39,748 --> 00:31:42,549
But now the day is
over and I'm done.

538
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:46,502
- Excuse me?
- Pulling me off
of Hahn's surgery

539
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:50,857
was an abuse of power. You
know, you needed help, OK.

540
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:53,593
But you used me. Because
of the color of my skin.

541
00:31:53,695 --> 00:31:56,646
I mean, you compromised
the quality of my education

542
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:01,151
because of my
color. I resent it.

543
00:32:14,983 --> 00:32:16,316
You saved her life.

544
00:32:16,418 --> 00:32:18,936
No, I fixed her brain.
Restored motor skills.

545
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:22,355
A stressful, extremely
difficult procedure, but no.

546
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:24,357
You saved her life.

547
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:56,006
OK.

548
00:32:56,108 --> 00:32:58,075
Thanks. That was...

549
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:00,576
OK.

550
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:04,163
- Your voice is shaking.
- I'm an imperfect person.

551
00:33:21,283 --> 00:33:23,149
Are his parents coming?

552
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:27,353
They're on a plane from
California. You gonna wait?

553
00:33:27,456 --> 00:33:29,689
Yeah. I'm gonna wait.

554
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:53,296
- Hey.
- I don't want you
to date other people.

555
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:56,032
It may not be enough
for you, but I'm trying here.

556
00:33:56,134 --> 00:34:00,187
So I don't want you to date
anybody but me. That's it.

557
00:34:04,693 --> 00:34:09,496
Except... I'm scared
as hell to want you.

558
00:34:09,598 --> 00:34:11,709
But here I am
wanting you anyway.

559
00:34:11,733 --> 00:34:16,302
And fear means I have
something to lose, right?

560
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:18,138
And I don't want to lose you.

561
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:26,729
- Meredith.
- Don't. Don't say anything.

562
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:30,400
I'm gonna leave and you
can say something tomorrow.

563
00:34:31,352 --> 00:34:33,252
That's progress, right?

564
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:50,720
Hey. Hey. Hey. Are
you...? Are you really OK?

565
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:53,757
Yeah. Yeah.

566
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:56,325
Alex. Come on. That was intense.

567
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,095
Intense and crazy
and just awful.

568
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:03,133
How can you be OK
after a day like that?

569
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:08,070
Alex. Alex. Why
won't you talk to me?

570
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:11,341
What do you want to
talk about, Rebecca?

571
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,610
How a guy almost bled
out while I watched?

572
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:16,045
How I got suspended
because you were there?

573
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:18,092
Ava. It's Ava. Not Rebecca.

574
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,283
Right. You're playing dress up.

575
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:24,120
You're here playing dress up.
You have a husband, Rebecca.

576
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:26,439
You have a baby.
And I have a life.

577
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,475
That girl you were talking to
when playing med student?

578
00:35:29,578 --> 00:35:32,528
I'm screwing her. She might
be a bigger wreck than I am,

579
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,832
but she's not married. She's
not gonna get me suspended.

580
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:38,318
She's not pretending to
be somebody she's not.

581
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,187
- Alex...
- Ask yourself
what you're doing here.

582
00:35:41,289 --> 00:35:43,239
Because, I think if
you can get honest,

583
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:46,076
if you could just tell the
damn truth for one minute,

584
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:48,512
I think you have to admit
you're not here to talk.

585
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,758
You did a good job today.

586
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:22,595
That was not easy. What
you did was not easy.

587
00:36:22,697 --> 00:36:24,480
It was brave.

588
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,786
We killed him.

589
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:33,022
The hospital...

590
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:38,761
Sloan, us...

591
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:41,965
We were not prepared.

592
00:36:46,721 --> 00:36:49,455
Yeah.

593
00:36:49,557 --> 00:36:51,857
Yeah, that happens sometimes.

594
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,426
That's...

595
00:36:55,581 --> 00:36:58,381
Do you have any idea
how backwards that is?

596
00:37:00,352 --> 00:37:02,219
We help more than we hurt.

597
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,828
I have no one.

598
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,607
This is gonna sound bizarre.

599
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:44,827
I realize, at this point, that
this is gonna sound bizarre,

600
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:49,566
but any chance you people
want to get a drink with me?

601
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,702
Why would we want to do that?

602
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:55,538
She's saying she needs a friend.

603
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:58,023
- OK. Fine. Let's drink.
- You won't hit on me?

604
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:00,877
- I can't promise that.
- If I say please?

605
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:03,096
He still can't promise that.

606
00:38:06,434 --> 00:38:07,667
Fine.

607
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,682
