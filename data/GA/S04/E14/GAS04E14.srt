1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,564
- <i>Previously on</i> Grey's
Anatomy: - He's gone.

2
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:07,556
Just wanted to get something
for the morning sickness.

3
00:00:07,658 --> 00:00:09,474
So my patient is not pregnant?

4
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,871
I could find patients
for a clinical trial.

5
00:00:11,895 --> 00:00:14,763
- Don't want you
getting hopes up.
- My hopes are not up.

6
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:16,977
You haven't slept
with her yet, have you?

7
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:18,600
- Know what's better than sex?
- What?

8
00:00:18,702 --> 00:00:19,785
Anticipation.

9
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:22,587
You are a crass,
predatory ape of a man

10
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,569
who just happens to
be a decent surgeon.

11
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:26,941
Any chance you people
wanna get a drink?

12
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:28,660
She's saying she needs a friend.

13
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:40,589
<i>There's this person.</i>

14
00:00:42,493 --> 00:00:44,760
<i>In my head.</i>

15
00:00:44,862 --> 00:00:47,395
<i>She is brilliant. Capable.</i>

16
00:00:47,498 --> 00:00:50,082
<i>She can do chest
tubes and craniotomies.</i>

17
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:53,585
<i>She can run a code
without freaking out.</i>

18
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:55,620
<i>She's a really good surgeon.</i>

19
00:00:55,706 --> 00:00:58,489
<i>Maybe even a great surgeon.</i>

20
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:00,742
<i>She's me.</i>

21
00:01:01,444 --> 00:01:03,661
<i>Only so much better.</i>

22
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:08,450
This is good news. Reflects
well on Seattle Grace.

23
00:01:08,552 --> 00:01:09,801
Yes, sir.

24
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:16,024
- Is Yang gonna have
a problem with it?
- I'd say so.

25
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,283
I'm afraid I'll never become
this person in my head,

26
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:26,351
because something
keeps getting in my way.

27
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:29,554
What's getting in your way?

28
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:33,691
Every time Derek walks into a room,
all I can think about is his tongue.

29
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,828
- In my mouth.
- So, you think
about kissing Derek?

30
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,881
It's making surgery
very difficult.

31
00:01:38,983 --> 00:01:42,267
So I need some
tools to help me stop.

32
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,435
I need some therapy
tools so that I can move on.

33
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:45,820
Sure you want to move on?

34
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:48,524
We have our fifth
clinical trial patient today.

35
00:01:48,626 --> 00:01:51,977
And the first four? We've learned
a lot, but we haven't saved one.

36
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,328
And I really want to save one.

37
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,615
So I can't be distracted
by things like tongues.

38
00:01:56,716 --> 00:02:00,652
- So I need the tools. Now.
- You're having fantasies
about Derek.

39
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:05,574
The only way to get rid of them
is to remind yourself of the reality.

40
00:02:06,577 --> 00:02:09,361
- Which is?
- You tell me.

41
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:14,499
Kissing's not going to
happen 'cause he's with Rose?

42
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,485
Powerful stuff, reality.

43
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:33,452
Good morning.

44
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:36,221
There's something I wanted
to say to you last night,

45
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,741
but by the time I thought
of it you were gone. I...

46
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:44,679
It's not my intention to torture
you. It's just not a thing I take lightly.

47
00:02:44,781 --> 00:02:47,816
The sex, with a new guy.

48
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,352
Rose, it's OK.

49
00:02:50,454 --> 00:02:52,687
It's like I said last
night, I respect that.

50
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:55,290
No, not the thing
I wanted to say.

51
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:58,326
The thing I wanted to say is...

52
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:01,746
I'm worth the wait.

53
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:13,141
- Has Cristina seen it?
- Not yet.

54
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,460
She's gonna freak.
Let's take it down.

55
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:17,763
- You can't.
- She never has to know.

56
00:03:17,848 --> 00:03:21,382
- She's gonna hear about it.
- Who's gonna hear about what?

57
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:23,747
What is going on?

58
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:25,787
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

59
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:30,525
Izzie, move your hand.

60
00:03:31,228 --> 00:03:33,761
Oh, come on, move it.

61
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,869
Good for him.

62
00:03:47,778 --> 00:03:52,063
No one wins the Harper Avery. I mean,
obviously, someone wins the Harper Avery

63
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,582
one person once a year,
but that's like no one.

64
00:03:54,685 --> 00:03:59,120
Burke won it. That is so weird, we
know someone who won the Harper Avery.

65
00:04:00,957 --> 00:04:01,990
You look like crap.

66
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:04,509
Joe let me pick up
some shifts at the bar.

67
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,511
- Working at the bar?
- Do me a favor.

68
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,457
Talk to Meredith.
See if she'd be OK

69
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,348
if Rebecca moved
in for a couple weeks.

70
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,300
- What?
- We're gonna get our own place.

71
00:04:12,402 --> 00:04:15,253
It's gonna take me a while
to save a security deposit.

72
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:19,640
- She's married.
- Yeah, well,
she's leaving her husband.

73
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:22,043
- She's telling him now.
- What about her kid?

74
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,913
I don't know. It's a mess,
but we're figuring it out.

75
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,599
Look, just ask
Mer. I'd do it myself,

76
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,945
but I don't want to
put her on the spot.

77
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,436
Alex, wait.

78
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:35,573
She's pregnant. She's knocked
up. Look, just talk to Meredith.

79
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:43,498
He's with Rose. He's with Rose.
He's with Rose. He's with Rose.

80
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,901
- Sorry I'm late.
- Just getting started.

81
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,820
Darren, Mr. Covington.

82
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,682
- I'm Dr. Grey.
- Jonathan Evett.

83
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,991
I've been treating
Darren at the VA.

84
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,460
We're glad you got
him into the clinical trial.

85
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:58,613
So you're going to inject
a virus into my son's brain.

86
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,615
Not in the brain,
Dad. In the tumor.

87
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:04,770
The theory is that the virus
will attack the tumor and shrink it.

88
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:07,389
Does it work? Has
anybody gotten better?

89
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:10,809
No.

90
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:13,578
But with each patient we
learn, make adjustments.

91
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,897
There's an enormous
amount of risk involved.

92
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:19,433
That's OK. He survived
two tours in Afghanistan.

93
00:05:19,535 --> 00:05:22,153
He's used to risk. Sir.

94
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,405
Mr. Covington.

95
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,609
- Todd.
- Your dad called me.

96
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:30,529
What'd you do, call
my whole platoon, Dad?

97
00:05:30,614 --> 00:05:34,181
If you're gonna beat this, you
need your friends by your side.

98
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,960
Dr. Sloan?

99
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,065
Hey, I've got a baby out
here, needs to get to daycare.

100
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:52,745
Dr. Bailey.

101
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,685
Dr. Bailey's baby.

102
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:56,221
It appears Nurse Tanya is

103
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:59,758
no longer available for
your liposuction at ten.

104
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,860
Shall I cancel the procedure?

105
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:06,747
Give me another nurse.
Give me Kate. Yeah.

106
00:06:09,186 --> 00:06:10,502
Really?

107
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:15,206
Dr. Torres? Dr. Sloan would like
to use Nurse Kate this morning.

108
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,093
Currently she's scheduled
for your arthroplasty,

109
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:21,078
but if you're willing to move
it, perhaps she could do both.

110
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,547
Ow!

111
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:28,219
- Dr. Torres? I know you're in there.
- Fine.

112
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:31,589
Just an hour later or an hour
earlier, whatever. Hey, Tuck.

113
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,808
Don't judge me, Bailey.

114
00:06:37,681 --> 00:06:39,498
Who would like to present?

115
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,136
Kyra Marshall. End stage cardiomyopathy
and COPD awaiting a heart transplant.

116
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:48,689
Antibody levels were so elevated she
was in danger of rejecting any donor heart.

117
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,859
How did we counteract that?

118
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:54,329
High levels of chemotherapy
to suppress her immune system.

119
00:06:54,431 --> 00:06:56,147
What precautions have we taken

120
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,834
to make sure that she is
not exposed to infection?

121
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:02,403
She's in a clean room,
a sterile environment

122
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,305
with strict isolation protocols.

123
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:06,241
Which are?

124
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:10,345
Yang, am I boring you? Because if
you'd rather spend the day in the morgue,

125
00:07:10,446 --> 00:07:15,433
I have about 50 cadaver hearts that
need to be harvested for my research.

126
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,735
So Kyra Marshall's protocols...

127
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,554
I would love to
go to the morgue.

128
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:22,523
Thank you.

129
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,576
- Do I have to go?
- She's your resident.

130
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:30,281
Let Yang be an example to all of
you. There is no shame in grunt work.

131
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,551
Now, let's meet our
"mom in a plastic bubble."

132
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:37,288
Get me out of here, Lucas.
I need to get out of here!

133
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,425
- Get them
to let me out of here.
- Honey, calm down.

134
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:43,562
You said I'd have a heart in
three weeks, and it's been eight.

135
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:48,633
It has been eight weeks without
touching another human being.

136
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,470
- Kyra, listen to me.
- No!

137
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:56,958
- Kyra, you need
to listen to me.
- I want to leave!

138
00:07:57,076 --> 00:08:01,379
I want to hug my kids, and
I want to kiss my husband.

139
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,349
And, God, I'm
going crazy in here.

140
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:07,385
- Kyra, come here. Kyra, take my hand.
- No.

141
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,637
Kyra, take my hand.

142
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,653
You are going to
leave here soon.

143
00:08:14,677 --> 00:08:16,689
That is what I came to tell you.

144
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:18,263
We have a heart for you.

145
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,886
We have a heart.

146
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,940
- You paged me, chief?
- Human Resources called.

147
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:33,911
As of this morning, the nurses
are boycotting your surgeries.

148
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,147
I haven't done
anything to the nurses.

149
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,815
Nothing that could get us sued.

150
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,118
Well, they felt strongly
enough about it

151
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,853
that they sent their union rep.

152
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,060
Adele?

153
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:52,296
Hello, Richard, Dr. Sloan.

154
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,165
Wait, your wife's
the union goon?

155
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,150
Nurse mediator, Dr. Sloan.

156
00:08:56,252 --> 00:08:59,371
And you know Wayne
Sheehan from Human Resources.

157
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:02,207
- But how did you...?
- Adele used to be a nurse.

158
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,508
Apparently she's
gotten back into the field.

159
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:08,046
That's right, Richard. I'm
not just a housewife anymore.

160
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:12,600
There've been complaints
about Dr. Sloan of a sexual nature,

161
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:16,304
complaints which this hospital
has, up until now, ignored.

162
00:09:16,406 --> 00:09:18,373
Hey, everything I
did was consensual.

163
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,408
In fact, some of them
even begged for it.

164
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,611
No formal harassment
complaints have been filed.

165
00:09:23,713 --> 00:09:28,950
However, the board has decided
to aggressively protect itself

166
00:09:29,052 --> 00:09:31,002
from possible future litigation.

167
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,738
So, as of today, if
a hospital employee

168
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,974
is having a sexual relationship
with another employee,

169
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,110
they have got to register it.

170
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:43,365
Three other hospitals in the state are
already implementing policies like this.

171
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:46,183
- It's called date and tell.
- This some kind of joke?

172
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:50,905
Do you want to wait until you have
a $20-million lawsuit on your hands?

173
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:54,792
Fill out the form. Shut up
and fill out the damn form.

174
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,377
And you too, Richard.

175
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:13,177
Adele, what's going on?

176
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,247
I've been talking about
getting recertified for years.

177
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,083
I finally went and did it.

178
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:22,120
- Look, if you
needed more money...
- I don't need more money.

179
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,821
I have 50 percent of yours.

180
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:27,075
What I need is to
be taken seriously.

181
00:10:27,177 --> 00:10:31,562
I'm working. I'm
loving it. I've changed.

182
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:37,836
Well... that's good.

183
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:41,055
I'm glad.

184
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,842
You know...

185
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,810
- I've changed, too.
- How?

186
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:48,190
I'm spending more time at home.

187
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,313
I'm... I'm delegating.

188
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,449
- I've heard that before.
- No, no.

189
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,135
I've gotten myself an intern.

190
00:10:55,605 --> 00:10:57,822
My own intern.

191
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:00,942
- The chief's intern.
- Hmm.

192
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,796
Change.

193
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,432
Feels good, doesn't it?

194
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:14,322
Dr. Yang, are you OK?

195
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,890
I just wanted to check
because you passed up

196
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:21,345
a really awesome
transplant case with Dr. Hahn.

197
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:26,667
Is this about the
thing with Dr. Burke?

198
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:30,437
I know that you two
were together, and...

199
00:11:38,848 --> 00:11:42,583

200

00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,014
I'll just go upstairs
and go charting.

214
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:37,238
<i>♪ Like a virgin ♪</i>

215
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,659
We need to get
aggressive with the virus.

216
00:12:41,744 --> 00:12:45,880
If we inject the tumor in two
sites we can actually saturate it

217
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:48,249
and have a real impact.

218
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:53,537
OK, now needle number
one will go into the tumor here,

219
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,675
by the middle cerebral artery.

220
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,679
Needle number
two goes right here.

221
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,449
Now, for the virus
to take full effect,

222
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,984
we need to inject it at
exactly the same time.

223
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,286
- Same time.
- Mm-hm.

224
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:10,704
You're needle number two.

225
00:13:10,806 --> 00:13:13,107
Don't be nervous,
we're gonna practice.

226
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,981
Now, we'll use the fluorescein

227
00:13:21,084 --> 00:13:24,502
to help us isolate the tumor
from the surrounding tissue.

228
00:13:30,826 --> 00:13:32,293
OK.

229
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:37,465
Now, remember, we have
to be completely in synch.

230
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,818
OK? Let me know
when you're ready.

231
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,324
He's with Rose. He's with Rose.
He's with Rose. He's with Rose.

232
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:50,344
- O'Malley?
- Oh, hey, chief.

233
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:54,148
- What are you doing?
- Just running labs
for Meredith.

234
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,816
Running labs for Meredith?

235
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,286
Does that sit right with you,

236
00:13:58,388 --> 00:13:59,987
George O'Malley running labs?

237
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,307
Well, I'm
Meredith's intern, sir.

238
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:05,510
Well, it doesn't
sit right with me.

239
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:08,913
I've been watching you,
O'Malley, and frankly, I'm worried.

240
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,665
A guy like you can't
get too comfortable.

241
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:15,169
A guy like you
needs a challenge.

242
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,206
Needs change.

243
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:22,310
Now that you mention it, I have
been feeling a little unchallenged.

244
00:14:22,412 --> 00:14:24,662
You're George O'Malley.

245
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:29,517
What would you think about
being my intern? The chief's intern?

246
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:30,880
The chief's intern?

247
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:35,239
George O'Malley,
intern to the chief.

248
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,636
- George O'Malley,
intern to the chief.
- Yes.

249
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,627
Is that even a real thing?

250
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:41,429
It is if I say it is.

251
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:43,381
Do you like princesses?

252
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,717
Um, yeah, sure.

253
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,820
When you take out Mommy's
broken heart, what happens?

254
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:53,557
Well, we're gonna put her
on a heart lung machine.

255
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,461
It's like in<i> Snow White</i> when
she eats the poison apple

256
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,146
and she dies for a while,
but she's not really dead.

257
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:02,583
- My mom's going to be dead?
- Snow White dies?

258
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:07,404
When they're little you
skip over the scary parts.

259
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:10,074
- I'm really sorry.
- It's OK, you don't have kids.

260
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:12,176
How would you know?

261
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:17,782
Rebecca, hi, it's
Dr. Stevens, again.

262
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:23,588
I have your test results. I really
need you to call me back. Thanks.

263
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,440
If I can't get hold
of my patient,

264
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:27,675
is it OK to give her
test results to her friend?

265
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:31,579
- No.
- What if her friend
is changing his life for her

266
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,281
because he thinks she's
pregnant and she's not?

267
00:15:34,384 --> 00:15:38,419
You want to win yourself a Harper
Avery, master the basics of privacy.

268
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:42,690
The chief needs to know who you've slept
with by the end of the day. Be thorough.

269
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:46,227
Chief needs to know who you've slept
with by the end of the day. Be thorough.

270
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,896
The chief needs to know
who you've slept with

271
00:15:48,998 --> 00:15:51,331
by the end of the
day. Be thorough.

272
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:55,519
- This is no one's business.
- It's the chief's business,
so it's my business.

273
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,022
- I'm the chief's intern.
- Let me see that.

274
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,625
Oh. The chief said
you're the only person

275
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,994
in the hospital who is exempt.

276
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:04,578
Congratulations.

277
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,879
Uh-huh.

278
00:16:08,618 --> 00:16:11,835
What do they mean
by "sexual relations"?

279
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:15,806
Yes, they mean relations
that are sexual in nature.

280
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:19,127
Yeah, I got that,
but there are levels.

281
00:16:20,363 --> 00:16:22,080
Of intimacy.

282
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:25,082
Oh! Uh...

283
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:28,753
Well, they don't
need to know the...

284
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:30,954
They just want to know the...

285
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,907
highest level.

286
00:16:36,045 --> 00:16:39,913
OK, then. Um, I won't
need one of these.

287
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:44,651
Oh.

288
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:47,221
Sure. OK.

289
00:16:48,991 --> 00:16:51,708
I just don't know
how to turn this back.

290
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,328
- Freak.
- I am not a...

291
00:16:56,499 --> 00:17:00,685
- I am the chief's intern.
- Mm-hm. OK. That's not a real job.

292
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:03,036
I just need the form
by the end of the day.

293
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,542
Now, let's see, what's going
on in Seattle Grace today.

294
00:17:08,645 --> 00:17:11,378
One of our former surgeons
won the Harper Avery Award,

295
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:15,449
another is leading a trial that will
change the course of neurosurgery,

296
00:17:15,551 --> 00:17:20,120
and last but not least, one of our
surgeons has screwed so many nurses

297
00:17:20,222 --> 00:17:23,257
that now everyone has to
document their sexual histories.

298
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,158
Walk tall, my friend, walk tall.

299
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,130
- You putting Rose on that form?
- That's none of your business.

300
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:33,418
That's a "no," which means she
still hasn't let you sleep with her.

301
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:37,314
What's she got,
treasure up there?

302
00:17:37,373 --> 00:17:41,709
It's because I don't
have a penis, isn't it?

303
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:44,444
Um...

304
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:46,864
I publish more, I do
double the research.

305
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:51,702
I deserve this more than Burke.
It's a big men's club and it's not fair.

306
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,839
Huh. I didn't even realize
you were being considered.

307
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:57,908
I wasn't going to
mention it until I won.

308
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:02,095
Then I was going to be all nonchalant
like awards don't matter to me.

309
00:18:02,198 --> 00:18:06,117
It was gonna be very
impressive and humble.

310
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,752
Now Burke's gone and
ruined my whole act.

311
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:12,339
You want to meet me at Joe's
tonight? We can trash talk him.

312
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,426
Oh.

313
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:18,012
I can't, I have
this other thing.

314
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:25,302
What? I do, I
have this... thing.

315
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,807
Hey, can you talk to the nurses?

316
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:32,527
I need someone
to stand up to them,

317
00:18:32,629 --> 00:18:36,480
tell them to call off the
boycott, tell them I'm a good guy.

318
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:41,368
Here's the problem. We
don't think you are a good guy.

319
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,989
Dr. Torres thinks I'm a
good guy. Don't you, Callie?

320
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,957
Um...

321
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:59,353
- On call room. Now.
- Whoa. You think
I'm a very good guy.

322
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,155
Little pinch.

323
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:09,129
What's the recovery
period for brain surgery?

324
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,850
It varies, but usually at
least four to six weeks.

325
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:15,336
You'll be stuck with
me for four to six weeks.

326
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:19,223
Don't be an idiot, Todd.
You deploy in five days, man.

327
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,792
That was before I knew
you had a brain tumor.

328
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:25,279
No, don't screw this up for
yourself. You're a soldier.

329
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:27,861
I'm probably not gonna
make it through surgery.

330
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,568
Cool. Then I'll be good
to go in about five days,

331
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,404
so why are we even
having this argument?

332
00:19:38,661 --> 00:19:40,277
Why did you come, man?

333
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,413
How could I not?

334
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:56,594
God, you're so paranoid.

335
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,707
Mr. Covington!

336
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:35,499
Get out.

337
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,019
Don't make me throw you out.

338
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:44,858
What's wrong?

339
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,794
Nothing's wrong, sir.

340
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,614
Nothing at all.

341
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,365
Thank you for the
consult, Dr. Sloan.

342
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:12,552
- No.
- I haven't said anything.

343
00:21:12,654 --> 00:21:15,272
- Not talking to the nurses.
- You're dating my best friend.

344
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:18,275
- Helping me is a duty,
as his girl.
- No.

345
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,778
You're one of them.
Tell them I'm a good guy.

346
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,513
A good guy who's
mind-blowingly good at sex.

347
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,216
Yeah, see, but that, all
the talk about all the sex,

348
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,253
that's not what I think
of as good guy behavior.

349
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,589
You know what you are?

350
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,992
You're a tease. I
hate women like you.

351
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:38,112
You string guys along
acting like sex is some prize,

352
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,863
this thing they have to earn.

353
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,000
You're afraid that once you
give it up, he'll lose interest.

354
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:46,553
Oh, and by the way,
I am a good guy.

355
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,680
Time for a haircut, Darren.

356
00:21:59,301 --> 00:22:01,902
Mr. Covington, would
you mind waiting outside?

357
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:06,423
- I get nervous
when I'm being watched.
- No problem.

358
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,492
Thanks.

359
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:14,097
- Thanks.
- You look like you
could use a break.

360
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:19,336
Yeah, the... not
talking about the thing

361
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:22,773
everybody's thinking about
gets a little exhausting.

362
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,442
You know, my
dad's not a bad guy.

363
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:29,080
He's just a soldier.

364
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:33,266
- We're all soldiers.
- Todd's down in the lobby.

365
00:22:33,368 --> 00:22:36,387
He's such an idiot.

366
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:40,190
He should just go. Put me
out of his mind and just...

367
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:44,061
- That's not so easy to do.
- It'd be better for everyone.

368
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:47,414
With Dr. Evett hanging around,
Todd can't risk getting outed.

369
00:22:47,516 --> 00:22:49,350
He'd lose everything
he worked for.

370
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:53,754
- Crazy that you
even have to worry.
- Don't ask, don't tell.

371
00:22:53,856 --> 00:22:56,440
Yeah, I knew the
deal when I signed on.

372
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:02,713
You keep your personal life
separate from your work life.

373
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:07,851
I just never thought I'd
meet my personal life at work.

374
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:15,141
- I can still go get Todd.
- No. I can't.

375
00:23:16,044 --> 00:23:17,845
My dad, I can't.

376
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,450
I know what you're thinking.

377
00:23:23,552 --> 00:23:27,321
Brave soldier can't even
step up to his own father.

378
00:23:27,423 --> 00:23:29,773
I was thinking this is hard.

379
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:33,677
The gay part or the tumor part?

380
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,514
The whole part.

381
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,943
I need your form. Lexie! I
need you to fill out a form.

382
00:23:49,045 --> 00:23:50,455
- What's this?
- Sex police.

383
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:52,479
Meredith, I'm gonna
need your form.

384
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:55,049
Don't ask, don't tell,
George. Forms are stupid.

385
00:23:55,151 --> 00:23:57,684
I'm still gonna need
it, though. Pen?

386
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:03,256
- I think I'll
take one of those.
- What? Why?

387
00:24:04,793 --> 00:24:06,927
Oh.

388
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:15,702
- Just...
- Thank you.

389
00:24:17,073 --> 00:24:19,584
- I'm so sorry.
- Do you want me
to get Cristina?

390
00:24:19,608 --> 00:24:24,211
Derek is with Rose. And I
am OK that Derek is with Rose.

391
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:28,365
Get Cristina. Get her form.

392
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,683
You don't want to go
near Cristina right now.

393
00:24:30,786 --> 00:24:32,266
- Is she crying?
- No.

394
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:36,223
- She staring ahead
being scary quiet?
- She's singing.

395
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:42,996
- I still need your form.
- Here, perv boy. Enjoy.

396
00:24:43,098 --> 00:24:44,698
This isn't complete.

397
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:47,651
It's fine.

398
00:24:49,171 --> 00:24:50,503
What?

399
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:56,192
Oh, right. Sorry, I forgot.

400
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,451
- He forgot he had sex with me?
- I just collect forms.

401
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,737
He forgot he had sex with me?

402
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,125
<i>♪ You're so fine
and you're mine ♪</i>

403
00:25:11,227 --> 00:25:12,609
Stop singing.

404

<i>♪ Make me strong ♪</i>

405
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:19,115
<i>♪ Yeah, you make me

406
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,852
You're going to win your
own Harper Avery Award.

407
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:24,871
<i>- ♪ Yeah, your love</i>
<i>thawed out ♪</i>
- Burke wouldn't have a career

408
00:25:24,974 --> 00:25:26,540
if it hadn't been for you.

409
00:25:26,642 --> 00:25:28,626
You saved him when
he had his tremor.

410
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:30,895
The Harper Avery Board
may not know it, but he does.

411
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,665

00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,736
I'm in therapy.

414
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:45,058
Because he's with Rose. I'm
way more screwed up than you are.

415
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:53,584
Thank you.

416
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:56,336
That makes me
feel a little better.

417
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,354
You're welcome.

418
00:26:05,748 --> 00:26:07,481
Chief, it... Adele.

419
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:10,133
Is it true you have every
member of the hospital

420
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,670
filling out this form, listing their
personal and sexual relations?

421
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:17,391
That's right. We are
taking this very seriously.

422
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,527
But I am exempt
from this? Me. Just me.

423
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:23,463
I'm not even asked if I
need to fill out a form?

424
00:26:23,565 --> 00:26:27,317
You're Bailey. I don't even
want to see you holding the form.

425
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,208
OK, then.

426
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:37,460
What you don't know about women.

427
00:26:41,816 --> 00:26:43,083
What?

428
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,436
Tyler will be taking
everyone's temperature.

429
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:48,505
Because of Mrs.
Marshall's immune system,

430
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:52,959
anyone over 100
degrees is not scrubbing in.

431
00:26:53,062 --> 00:26:56,647
- One hundred point four.
- Sorry, Karev.

432
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:58,498
Come on. I'm fine.

433
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,861
No, apparently, you're not.

434
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:02,352
I'm not putting
Mrs. Marshall at risk.

435
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,087
Page Yang, she's scrubbing in.

436
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:05,901
You go get Mrs.
Marshall's family.

437
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:08,825
You're on babysitting
duty the rest of the day.

438
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:22,122
Darren.

439
00:27:27,763 --> 00:27:29,279
We can take a moment.

440
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:42,242
- No.
- Are you sure?

441
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,283
No.

442
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:54,338
Let's just go.

443
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:15,659
OK, remember what I said.
We have to be in total synch

444
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:19,179
for the virus to have
maximum infiltration.

445
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:20,664
OK?

446
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:22,348
Ready?

447
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,202
Go.

448
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:36,947
Easy, slow down.

449
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,683
Easy, slow down, slow
down. Look at me. Look at me.

450
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:41,869
Don't look at the
machine, look at me.

451
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:43,303
Slowly.

452
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,607
Breathe.

453
00:28:48,377 --> 00:28:49,876
That's it.

454
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:52,896
That's it.

455
00:29:01,457 --> 00:29:03,056
The virus is in.

456
00:29:07,229 --> 00:29:09,396
We're standing on
the moon, Dr. Grey.

457
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,070
The donor heart's on its way.

458
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,261
Can't imagine how you
must feel about Burke's award.

459
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:26,863
You actually helped
him with all that research,

460
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:29,466
he didn't even mention
you in the article.

461
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:35,889
Well, I guess it's no surprise.
His arrogance is legendary.

462
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,379
Well, I thought we finally
had some common ground.

463
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,301
Good for you.

464
00:29:48,404 --> 00:29:51,505
Refusing to trash
him. Rising above.

465
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:54,824
That's very impressive, mature.

466
00:29:55,977 --> 00:29:58,712
He would love it if he
knew how bitter I am.

467
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,383
Well, I am not gonna
give him that satisfaction.

468
00:30:03,485 --> 00:30:06,753
I am going to follow
your example, Yang.

469
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:12,158
Congratulations,
Preston, I wish you well.

470
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:27,323
I wanted to drop off the form myself,
answer any questions you might have.

471
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:28,976
Questions about what?

472
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,546
There are interns
listed on this form.

473
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:36,149
I require the energy of youth.

474
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:39,852
Dr. Shepherd was just a
moment of weakness for both of us.

475
00:30:39,955 --> 00:30:42,755
- Dr. Sloan?
- That was many moments.

476
00:30:42,857 --> 00:30:47,261
- In on call rooms. Very hot.
- Mmm, steamy.

477
00:30:47,363 --> 00:30:53,283
- I'm surprised
you haven't listed me.
- You're not my type.

478
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:57,954
- All right, Dr. Bailey,
I get the joke.
- See, this is a joke to you.

479
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,190
I am a single woman.

480
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:03,160
I've been a single
woman for some time now,

481
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:06,796
but the very idea that I could
have a sexual encounter,

482
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:10,133
a consensual sexual
encounter, is a joke to you?

483
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,568
Dr. Bailey...

484
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,748
So much so, that you
would single me out

485
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:15,072
of this entire hospital,

486
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:17,318
as the one person
who couldn't interest

487
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,609
a member of the opposite sex?

488
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,144
It's... It's just...

489
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,563
- It's harassment.
- Adele!

490
00:31:23,665 --> 00:31:26,917
Just, shame on you,
sir! Just shame on you!

491
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:35,008
I made it all up, Wayne.

492
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:45,535
- Liquids. For your fever. Drink this.
- I'm fine.

493
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:47,653
Can't keep working
at Joe's. You're sick.

494
00:31:47,755 --> 00:31:49,406
- You're run-down.
- I'm fine.

495
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:51,353
Getting in the
way of your career.

496
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:55,128
You're taking on too much.
You and Rebecca need to talk.

497
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,474
She can't just move.

498
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,415
- Slow down.
- What's your problem?

499
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,917
You can't pass a
baby without stopping.

500
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,954
The only baby in the world
you're not happy about is mine.

501
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:07,123
- It's not that
I'm not happy for you.
- What?

502
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:12,011
- Nothing.
- Yeah. That's what I thought.

503
00:32:22,057 --> 00:32:24,157
You can run, but you can't hide.

504
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:27,728
What? No, I
wasn't... I was just...

505
00:32:32,134 --> 00:32:34,801
So are we on for
tonight or what?

506
00:32:34,903 --> 00:32:39,138
Um... I don't know. I mean, I
told you I have this other thing.

507
00:32:43,979 --> 00:32:47,513
I don't make friends easily.

508
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:51,801
I'm awkward and
I'm bad at small talk.

509
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:54,470
And I generally don't
like people I don't know.

510
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:58,675
But I made friends with you.

511
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:02,512
And now you have this
thing, and that thing is Sloan.

512
00:33:03,632 --> 00:33:06,066
Are you mad that I'm
sleeping with Mark Sloan?

513
00:33:06,168 --> 00:33:08,112
I'm not mad you're
sleeping with Sloan.

514
00:33:08,136 --> 00:33:12,188
I'm mad that you didn't tell me you're
sleeping with Sloan. I'm mad at you.

515
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:16,042
Instead of telling me and admitting
that you're one of those girls

516
00:33:16,144 --> 00:33:20,213
who goes all poofy when she
gets a boyfriend, you disappear.

517
00:33:20,315 --> 00:33:22,115
With your "thing."

518
00:33:23,518 --> 00:33:25,452
Mark Sloan.

519
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:32,075
I don't make friends easily.

520
00:33:40,802 --> 00:33:42,936
We were able to
saturate the tumor.

521
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:46,556
We'll do an MRI in the morning
and see if the tumor has shrunk.

522
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:48,141
But you're optimistic?

523
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:52,929
Cautiously optimistic.

524
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:55,948
That was great. Totally in
synch, like we were one person.

525
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:59,853
- Yeah. It was great. You did great.
- Thanks.

526
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:06,359
Obviously his intracranial pressure's
going to need to be monitored overnight.

527
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,821
So, you just tell
me the parameters.

528
00:34:08,897 --> 00:34:11,781
I'll stay. I mean, we can...

529
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,284
We can stay together.

530
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,370
How'd it go?

531
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:21,174
Great. It went
really, really well.

532
00:34:21,276 --> 00:34:23,242
Dr. Grey had one of the...

533
00:34:24,512 --> 00:34:27,063
She had one of the...
one of the injections.

534
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:30,851
Well, I was just... I was heading
home and I didn't know if you wanted...

535
00:34:30,953 --> 00:34:32,652
Yeah, right.

536
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:34,321
I need to stay here tonight.

537
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,423
- Oh, OK.
- OK?

538
00:34:37,526 --> 00:34:38,692
I'll just...

539
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:45,398
- OK.
- Rose! Wait.

540
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,369
- Two, I...
- What?

541
00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:53,589
- I can page you
if there's problems.
- I'll stay.

542
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:57,810
If you want me
to stay, I'll stay.

543
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:02,832
No, you should go be with Rose.

544
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,327
Sex. Let's go.

545
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,218
Are you coming?

546
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:24,988
I'm just...

547
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:28,224
- not in the mood.
- What? You're always
in the mood.

548
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,009
I know.

549
00:35:30,946 --> 00:35:32,612
But I'm just...

550
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:36,883
All my surgeries
got canceled today.

551
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,005
Wanna go grab a cup of coffee?

552
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:45,908
- Talk?
- You're useless.

553
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:55,852
- The donor heart just arrived.
- I think something's wrong!

554
00:35:55,954 --> 00:36:00,573
- She's having
trouble breathing.
- I think her lung has dropped.

555
00:36:00,675 --> 00:36:03,259
- Page Hahn!
- Right away, Dr. Karev.

556
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,760
She's not moving!

557
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,752
What are you doing?
You can't go in there!

558
00:36:12,854 --> 00:36:15,421
You can't break
the isolation barrier!

559
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,623
Mr. Marshall, get
your kids out of here!

560
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:25,031
- Is she dying?
- Mr. Marshall, your kids!

561
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:27,934
Don't let her die,
please don't let her die!

562
00:36:28,036 --> 00:36:31,304
OK. Jessie, Zoe,
this is the scary part,

563
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:34,457
so I need you guys to turn
around. Come on, just turn around.

564
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:37,960
I know what I'm doing.
I'll tell you when it's over.

565
00:36:47,856 --> 00:36:50,857
OK, Zoe, Jesse. It's OK. You
can look at your mommy now.

566
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:55,995
- Mommy's OK. Oh, God!
- It's OK. It's OK.

567
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:03,469
Here are the forms. Alphabetized,
broken down by department.

568
00:37:03,571 --> 00:37:07,223
See that, Adele? I didn't have
to lift a finger. I'm delegating.

569
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:12,529
- Well, I've seen
some progress today.
- Well, thank you.

570
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,353
Dr. Webber, may I have
a word with you, privately?

571
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:22,739
I'll be right outside.

572
00:37:24,792 --> 00:37:30,363
I gave up a major surgery today and all
my friends think I'm a brownnosing perv.

573
00:37:30,465 --> 00:37:35,051
But I... It was worth it because
I thought that you saw me.

574
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:40,005
But, all due respect, sir, you're using
me to get back together with your wife.

575
00:37:40,107 --> 00:37:41,107
O'Malley.

576
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,237
I don't know if
it's possible to quit

577
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,539
a thing that isn't
even a real thing,

578
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:51,067
- but I do. I quit.
- O'Malley, wait.

579
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:56,772
The truth is I do
see you, O'Malley.

580
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:59,558
I see how hard you work.

581
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:03,780
The chief's intern is not a
real job. But I'd like it to be.

582
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,301
Let's give him acetaminophen,
add 500 of vancomycin.

583
00:38:09,403 --> 00:38:11,838
- Good.
- And blood
and urine cultures also.

584
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,224
If you want to take a
break, I'll sit with him.

585
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:16,609
- No, I'm OK.
- OK.

586
00:38:18,346 --> 00:38:21,146
<i>♪ And that kiss ♪</i>

587
00:38:21,249 --> 00:38:25,918
<i>♪ That kiss was so, so true ♪</i>

588
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:30,307
<i>♪ I guess I should know better ♪</i>

589
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:32,291
V-fib! V-fib.

590
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,794
- Charge paddles to 300.
- They're charged.

591
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,496
- Clear!
- Clear.

592
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,676
I know my being here
makes you feel uncomfortable,

593
00:38:50,779 --> 00:38:55,247
but I was trained not to leave a man
when he's down. Our man is down.

594
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:58,134
- Todd.
- We both love him.

595
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:00,052
- Todd...
- No!

596
00:39:01,189 --> 00:39:03,669
All I want to know
is how he's doing.

597
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:11,998
Oh, God.

598
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:15,901
<i>♪ When it comes to falling ♪</i>

599
00:39:16,004 --> 00:39:18,187
Dr. Karev saved your life,

600
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:22,775
but the chance that you were
exposed to infection is too great.

601
00:39:22,877 --> 00:39:26,445
- Can she get another heart?
- You'll be
at the top of the list.

602
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:33,486
But I'm going to have
to stay in isolation, right?

603
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:36,372
Dr. Karev.

604
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,991
Since the barrier was
already breached once today,

605
00:39:39,093 --> 00:39:42,896
we don't think a few minutes with
your family would be such a bad idea.

606
00:39:42,998 --> 00:39:47,216
As long as they scrub in and
take the necessary precautions.

607
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:51,020
So I can see my kids? They
can come in here with me?

608
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:54,057
I'll go get them
scrubbed in right now.

609
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:57,493
Guys, let's get scrubbed
in so we can see Mom.

610
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,066
Pathetic.

611
00:40:25,273 --> 00:40:26,572
Well, are you coming?

612
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:29,625
To an on call room?

613
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:46,959
Now, I'm going to save you. Do
you want to be saved? Or don't you?

614
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:05,628
Spinal tap showed encephalitis.

615
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,399
The virus reverted.

616
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:12,435
There's no way we
could have predicted this.

617
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:18,841
I shouldn't have
said I could handle it.

618
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,810
I shouldn't have let you go.

619
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:24,797
No, you did everything right.

620
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:40,212
You did what I would've done.

621
00:41:40,315 --> 00:41:43,599
On my way here, I
stopped and I got this.

622
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,370
For when we get it right.

623
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:51,374
Because we will.

624
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:56,145
We will succeed and
we will save someone.

625
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:59,415
Then, when we do, we're going
to open this bottle of champagne.

626
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:04,870
And we're going to drink to Phillip
Robinson and Darren Covington...

627
00:42:04,972 --> 00:42:10,493
and all the other patients who
helped us change the face of medicine.

628
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:12,462
And we're going to celebrate.

629
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:15,765
We're going to use
this as our victory dance.

630
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,801
Meredith, we will.

631
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,073
We're going to open
this bottle of champagne.

632
00:42:34,202 --> 00:42:38,104
Going through all the forms, I
noticed you didn't turn yours in.

633
00:42:38,205 --> 00:42:40,673
- No, sir.
- Well, I need you to.

634
00:42:40,775 --> 00:42:44,627
The hospital is still liable,
even though Dr. Burke isn't here.

635
00:43:04,065 --> 00:43:07,200
There. My sexual
relationship. Preston Burke.

636
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:10,853
- On paper. Satisfied?
- I know this is
difficult for you.

637
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:13,689
No, it's not difficult,
sir. It is simple.

638
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:17,760
Burke is not here. He's
gone. And he's the better for it.

639
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:21,998
He's winning the Harper Avery Award
and being celebrated all over the world.

640
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,565
That is not difficult.

641
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:27,436
He's out there. And I'm here.

642
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:29,438
Where everything is the same.

643
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,841
I still live in his apartment.

644
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:35,322
I walk the same halls of this
hospital. I wear the same scrubs.

645
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:39,015
Not even that is not
difficult. This is where I am.

646
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:41,250
This is where I choose to be.

647
00:43:43,054 --> 00:43:47,389
But, sir, when his
hand was shaking,

648
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,959
I performed his surgeries.

649
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:52,239
I kept his secrets,
I nursed his pride.

650
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:57,482
You know it and I know it
and he knows it. He knows it.

651
00:43:59,153 --> 00:44:03,305
And yet, nowhere in that newspaper
article does my name appear.

652
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:11,481
I am the unseen
hand to his brilliance.

653
00:44:13,451 --> 00:44:15,000
Excuse me.

654
00:44:17,004 --> 00:44:20,489
And yet while everything is...

655
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,495
the same, it's
very, very different.

656
00:44:25,597 --> 00:44:28,864
Now, I'm lucky if I
get to hold a clamp.

657
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,600
Hahn treats me like...

658
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:40,176
I was his hand and
now I'm a ghost.

659
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:43,645
That's not difficult.

660
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,217
It's unbearable.

661
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,054
I know everybody is
proud of him, but I'm not.

662
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:54,857
And I do not wish him well.

663
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:03,983
This boycott has
gone on long enough.

664
00:45:04,085 --> 00:45:06,318
Now, OK, I have
no authority here,

665
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:11,607
but I would like to offer
my thoughts on Dr. Sloan.

666
00:45:11,692 --> 00:45:13,525
- You're doing great.
- OK.

667
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:16,478
This man is a whore,

668
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:19,865
has always been a whore,
will probably always be a whore.

669
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,568
But that's not a secret.
He's not keeping it hidden.

670
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:25,588
You knew who he was before
you got involved with him.

671
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:29,525
And now you want to be all,
"Woe is me, he doesn't call me back,

672
00:45:29,627 --> 00:45:32,411
he's dating other
women." He's nasty!

673
00:45:32,513 --> 00:45:34,230
And that's not just you.

674
00:45:34,332 --> 00:45:37,549
He's sleeping with other
doctors and orderlies

675
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,117
and cafeteria workers.

676
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:43,756
But he's a doctor here
and a pretty good one.

677
00:45:43,858 --> 00:45:48,677
So let us all close our knees,
and get back to our jobs,

678
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:53,065
so he can get back to his job and
help the people that really need it!

679
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:59,104
Disperse!

680
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:08,364
Oh, my God.

681
00:46:10,317 --> 00:46:12,234
Hi.

682
00:46:17,925 --> 00:46:20,159
My baby.

683
00:46:22,563 --> 00:46:24,596
I heard you did great.

684
00:46:27,668 --> 00:46:29,188
- Alex.
- You think I'm scum.

685
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:32,120
You think I can't do this!
But it's my kid, Izzie, my kid.

686
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:34,582
And what you
think doesn't matter!

687
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:43,015
I want him to have
a military burial.

688
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:34,583
<i>It was a good day.</i>

689
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:38,603
Heading home.

690
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,823
Heading home early.

691
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:45,928
Maybe you have changed.

692
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,201
That's a nice blouse.

693
00:47:56,674 --> 00:47:59,842
The way you're looking
at me now, Richard...

694
00:47:59,944 --> 00:48:01,861
That's harassment.

695
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:10,252
<i>Maybe even a great day.</i>

696
00:48:15,276 --> 00:48:19,378
- Good night.
- Get in touch
with that patient?

697
00:48:20,581 --> 00:48:23,916
- No.
- Did you tell her friend?

698
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,302
No.

699
00:48:30,308 --> 00:48:33,509
Even though it
killed me, I didn't tell.

700
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:35,945
You're growing, Stevens.

701
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:38,513
Yeah, well, I
wish it would stop.

702
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:46,021
My husband is out on a date.

703
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:49,742
Right now. On a date.

704
00:48:51,863 --> 00:48:57,315
<i>♪ And the difference
astounding I should expect ♪</i>

705
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,420
<i>I was a good doctor.</i>

706
00:49:04,725 --> 00:49:06,742
<i>Even when it was hard.</i>

707
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:11,314
<i>I was the me in my head.</i>

708
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:15,618
<i>♪ And leave the
rest at arm's length ♪</i>

709
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:20,623
<i>♪ When they reach out, don't
touch them, don't touch them ♪</i>

710
00:49:20,725 --> 00:49:25,294
I just called three of my ex-boyfriends
to find out how unforgettable I am.

711
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:28,798
I left messages, I'm
sure they'll call me back.

712
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:31,339
So you made a mistake
and you slept with Alex.

713
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:34,737
No one has made more mistakes

714
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:37,473
or slept with more
inappropriate people

715
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:40,960
or been more publicly
humiliated than me.

716
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:43,512
Let me be an inspiration.

717
00:49:43,598 --> 00:49:47,082
Look at me, I am
the chief's intern.

718
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:52,972
I am the man at the
right hand of the man.

719
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:55,324
That...

720
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:03,332
OK, I've been avoiding you.

721
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:06,585
And I know it's stupid
and based on nothing,

722
00:50:06,687 --> 00:50:10,239
But, when she was
here, Addison said...

723
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:13,576
Well, she implied
that we were...

724
00:50:13,661 --> 00:50:15,928
That I was...

725
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,149
That, um...

726
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:25,888
you and I might be lesbians.

727
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:47,376
<i>There was a moment when
I thought, "I can't do this."</i>

728
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,852
Well, I'm glad some
things haven't changed.

729
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:02,440
<i>"I can't do this alone."</i>

730
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:17,890
The most refined, professional,
ladylike doctor in this hospital

731
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:19,825
came to my defense tonight.

732
00:51:19,927 --> 00:51:23,078
The best she could come
up with was, "He's a whore."

733
00:51:24,982 --> 00:51:26,949
I'm a whore.

734
00:51:28,068 --> 00:51:30,468
I slept with her.

735
00:51:30,571 --> 00:51:33,471
And the whole time I was
thinking about Meredith.

736
00:51:34,542 --> 00:51:36,441
Who's the bigger whore?

737
00:51:36,544 --> 00:51:41,213
<i>But I closed my eyes and
imagined myself doing it.</i>

738
00:51:43,668 --> 00:51:45,601
<i>And I did.</i>

739
00:51:45,703 --> 00:51:48,003
<i>I blocked out the fear.</i>

740
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:51,439
<i>And I did it.</i>

741
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:53,525
It was a really good day.

742
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:00,616
I'm just gonna say this because your
insurance only covers 20 sessions.

743
00:52:00,718 --> 00:52:03,219
And I feel we should
get right to the point.

744
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:05,271
That was a load of crap.

745
00:52:06,506 --> 00:52:09,240
It was not a good day.

746
00:52:09,342 --> 00:52:13,295
Your patient died alone, unable
to tell the love of his life how he felt.

747
00:52:13,397 --> 00:52:17,082
Yeah, but he did it for his
boyfriend. I think it was kind of heroic.

748
00:52:17,184 --> 00:52:19,618
- It's a load of crap.
- Stop saying that.

749
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,720
Let me draw the
parallels for you.

750
00:52:21,822 --> 00:52:23,756
The tragic patient dies alone

751
00:52:23,858 --> 00:52:28,560
while the love of his life
is literally in the next room.

752
00:52:28,662 --> 00:52:30,996
- That's you.
- What are you talking about?

753
00:52:31,098 --> 00:52:33,482
- I'm not dying alone.
- But I think you are.

754
00:52:33,584 --> 00:52:36,284
And you're telling
yourself you're a hero.

755
00:52:36,387 --> 00:52:40,122
- When in reality,
all you are is alone.
- That is a load of crap.

756
00:52:40,224 --> 00:52:41,824
He's with Rose.

757
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:47,312
You know what? I'm
not going to do this.

758
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,448
- He's with Rose.
- Why keep saying that?

759
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:52,984
If you can't see what's wrong
with that sentence, "He's with Rose,"

760
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:55,587
we're never gonna get
anywhere. He's with Rose.

761
00:52:55,689 --> 00:52:57,656
OK, so he's with Rose! So what?

762
00:52:57,758 --> 00:53:00,108
He's with Rose, that
means he's not with you.

763
00:53:00,211 --> 00:53:02,360
And do you know
why he's not with you?

764
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:05,714
You're scared.

765
00:53:06,733 --> 00:53:08,433
Are you calling me a coward?

766
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:14,924
- I think you're
very frightened, Dr. Grey.
- Are you calling me a coward?

767
00:53:15,026 --> 00:53:16,275
What do you think?
