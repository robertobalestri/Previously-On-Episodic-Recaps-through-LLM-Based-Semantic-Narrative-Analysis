<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,415
- The best breakup.
- She's doing McDreamy.

3
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:07,606
- Norman is an intern.
- I'm your sister.

4
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:09,691
You're not a girl I ever
wanted to have to know.

5
00:00:09,793 --> 00:00:12,594
- Because our dad chose you.
- My niece's cancer's back.

6
00:00:12,696 --> 00:00:15,680
She's 17 years old
and she's going to die.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,152
Alex, I'm sorry. I can't.

8
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:21,686
I slept with Izzie.

I just talked to Callie and...

36
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:37,145
- George!
- I got to find Izzie.

00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:40,582

Why would I want
to go away with you?

41
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:47,672
Because of this.

42
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,809
We didn't go away when we were
a couple. Now we're not a couple.

43
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:53,156
Not-couples have
no reason to go away.

44
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,763
You're not paying attention.

45
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,399

Sounds like a couples place.

49
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:06,691
There's wine. There's
country. We wouldn't see it.

50
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,643
We'd be in bed all weekend.

51
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:12,281
- Oh, a weekend of sex.
- Now you're paying attention.

52

someone to cover for me.

I'm stuck in the pit protecting
smackheads and gangbangers

58
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,783
from my interns, and
you're getting McDreamied.

59
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,486
Smackheads and
gangbangers at Seattle Grace?

60
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:37,372
- I hate interns.
- Lexie's not that bad, is she?

61
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:39,686
Oh, are we not
hating her anymore?

62
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,526
Oh, no. We still
hate the idea of her.

63
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:44,396
We realize we don't have a
reason to hate the actual person.

64
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:47,415
She's an intern.
That's reason enough.

65
00:02:47,517 --> 00:02:49,067
I think you may be the new Nazi.

66
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:52,937
- Damn right.
- I don't see any charts.

67
00:02:56,392 --> 00:02:59,127
- Will you work for me Saturday?
- What's in it for me?

68
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:01,630
- What do you want?
- Take Norman today.

69
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:04,199
- Who?
- The World's Oldest Intern.

70
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:06,017
He's only going to slow me down.

71
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,602
- Ageist.
- Deal?

72
00:03:07,704 --> 00:03:09,404
Fine.

73
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,025
- Rounds!
- I still can't find Izzie!

74
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,993
I'm gonna have to put you in
the clinic if you miss rounds.

75
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,263
The clinic!

76
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,733
Miss Sayles? I'm
Dr. Bailey. You are...?

77
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:23,334
Uh... the boyfriend.

78
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:26,705
Who warned her not to
read on the StairMaster.

79
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,574
That's how I did
this. I fell off last night.

80
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,109
I took a ton of ibuprofen,

81
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,496
but when I woke up this
morning, it was huge and hideous.

82
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:36,080
How much ibuprofen did you take?

83
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,800
I usually take some every
day because of the gym.

84
00:03:38,902 --> 00:03:41,436
So I doubled the dose,
but it did nothing for me.

85
00:03:41,538 --> 00:03:43,138
OK, let's get some X-rays...

86
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:45,759
Can I just get a shot of
cortisone or something?

87
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,992
I'm supposed to meet
my trainer at noon.

88
00:03:48,078 --> 00:03:49,677
Uh, Miss Sayles,
I can't treat you

89
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:51,947
until I find out what's
wrong with you.

90
00:03:54,184 --> 00:03:56,968
- Have you seen Dr. Stevens?
- Check the pit.

91
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,570
Right.

92
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,124
What time do you
think we'll be done?

93
00:04:02,226 --> 00:04:04,620
Just so I can tell my trainer.

94
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:09,881
Lexie! Sorry. Uh, have
you seen Dr. Stevens?

95
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,566
- No, you see Dr. Yang?
- No.

96
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,746
She told me to meet
her, she's not here.

97
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,882
Don't wanna give her
reasons to hate me.

98
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:19,541
Going to answer every question.
I'm not going to take her crap.

99
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:22,043
Three! Incoming! Let's move!

100
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:24,796
- Got hit during a scrimmage.
- You the coach?

101
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:26,309
- He's my dad.
- And coach.

102
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,199
He was charging the receiver.

103
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,902
He had his head down,
couldn't see the other guy.

104
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,572
I had my head down because
the guy blocking me was holding it.

105
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,467
You could've
gotten past that guy!

106
00:04:35,491 --> 00:04:39,494
I need you to leave the room.
Cut him out of his equipment.

107
00:04:39,596 --> 00:04:42,681
Dr. Grey, I need you to help
stabilize his neck and his head.

108
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,317
It's very important that
you not move your head.

109
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,154
I need you to keep perfectly
still. Do not move. Relax. Good.

110
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:58,396
- O'Malley, what's the hurry?
- I can't talk! I got to find...

111
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,116
O'Malley?

112
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:08,190
Sorry. I... I just
got to find Izzie.

113
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:10,491
She's at the third
floor nurses' station.

114
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:13,962
- Thanks.
- Oh, when you find her,

115
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,624
tell her Dr. Torres
is looking for her.

116
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:25,407
I know charting doesn't
seem as exciting as surgery,

117
00:05:25,508 --> 00:05:27,286
but it is every
bit as important.

118
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,478
Believe me when I tell you,
people, penmanship saves lives.

119
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,832
What kind of doctor
doesn't pick up their phone?

120
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,750
Is that a seven
or is that a nine?

121
00:05:35,852 --> 00:05:38,102
If I have to ask myself
that in an emergency,

122
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,303
your patient is dead.

123
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:42,307
You killed him. With
your handwriting.

124
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,043
Think about that.

125
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:48,380
Callie. Hey.

126
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,716
- We have to talk.
- OK.

127
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:55,219
- Um, about...?
- George told me.

128
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,956
- He told you...
- Everything.

129
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:01,476
Cafeteria. Noon.

130
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:04,095
You and me. Be there.

131
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,384
Dude. Is she going
to kick her ass?

132
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:23,464
- She forgave you?
- She said I had a rough year,

133
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:27,368
that people make mistakes,
and that I made a mistake.

134
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,654
Oh, so now I'm a mistake?

135
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,072
Back off!

136
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:34,159
- She said that. I didn't.
- What did you say?

137
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:38,896
Didn't expect her to forgive
me. I expected rage... bloodshed.

138
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:41,477
She's saving her rage
and bloodshed for me.

139
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,381
- She's gonna kill me.
- She wouldn't.

140
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,820
She breaks bones for
a living. She's crazy.

141
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:47,072
No, she's not crazy.

142
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:50,041
She is if she thinks I'm
not going to put up a fight.

143
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:53,289
I can't believe that kid's dad.

144
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,947
His son is paralyzed, and
the guy's still riding him.

145
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,884
Focus more on medicine,
Three, and less on the tragedy.

146
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:01,719
- Three? Is that a nickname?
- You could say that.

147
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,673
So how would you
proceed, Dr. Grey?

148
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:08,143
Oh, um... You won't
be able to operate

149
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:10,929
unless you realign
his spine, would you?

150
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:14,399
- How would you do that?
- Traction halo?

151
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,000
Very impressive, Dr. Grey.

152
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,203
Your intern year's
off to a good start.

153
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:21,339
How's it going? How
are you and Meredith?

154
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,642
Yeah, it's weird. The
whole family thing.

155
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:25,493
Plus I think she
might still hate me.

156
00:07:25,595 --> 00:07:28,129
- She doesn't hate you.
- Really? Did she say that?

157
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:30,932
See if Mrs. Cooley's
dressings needs changing.

158
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,850
Why don't you go see
if Mrs. Cooley's dressing

159
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,888
- needs changing?
- Certainly.

160
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,643
Dr. Sloan, Dr. Norman Shales.

161
00:07:41,745 --> 00:07:44,546
- Dr. Shales. Call me Mark.
- Thank you.

162
00:07:44,647 --> 00:07:46,676
I thought you
were on my service.

163
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,949
I am. He's my intern.

164
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,986
I know, right? Like,
"Seriously, you're an intern?"

165
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:53,972
But it's seriously
true. Seriously.

166
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:57,358
Glad to have you aboard, Norman.

167
00:07:57,461 --> 00:08:01,146
He the one you call
McDreamy or McSleazy?

168
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,481
Or Mc... Wait a
minute, what is it?

169
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,950
- We have labs to deliver.
- Yeah.

170
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,585
Labs and discharges.

171
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,927
This one's being
discharged to hospice?

172
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,656
When there's nothing
else we can do.

173
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,569
We tell someone they're dying?

174
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,760
Don't worry. I'll teach
you the protocol.

175
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:19,747
McSteamy! He's the one
you girls call McSteamy!

176
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:22,550
You paged me, Dr. Bailey?

177
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:25,253
- I didn't know you were...
- I'm in the clinic. Or I was.

178
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:28,306
- What do you got?
- Ruthie Sayles.

179
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:31,059
She twisted her ankle
falling off the StairMaster.

180
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:33,895
She crushed it. We should
book an OR right away.

181
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:36,864
You don't think we
should run tests?

182
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:39,178
Find out why Ruthie's
bones are fragile?

183
00:08:39,202 --> 00:08:42,020
She's osteoporotic. I see it
in older women all the time.

184
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:45,606
Now you're seeing
it in a 28-year-old.

185
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,976
Right. Call me when
you get the test results.

186
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,982
I can't talk about it with you.

187
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:57,936
- Well, is she all right?
- Yeah.

188
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,071
When giving a
patient the bad news,

189
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,090
be polite and
detached, but not cold.

190
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:04,993
- How can you be detached
but not cold?
- Show you care

191
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:07,478
without actually
allowing yourself to care.

192
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,048
If you get too emotional,
then they get scared.

193
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,149
Then they get
emotional and that's bad.

194
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,118
- Seriously?
- Stop the "seriously."

195
00:09:14,204 --> 00:09:15,398
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

196
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,689
It must be hard being
older than most of us,

197
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,974
but I think you're
going to go a lot further

198
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:23,528
if you just let everything else
go and focus on the medicine.

199
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,130
McDreamy and the
Other Grey are bonding.

200
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,383
Over their mutual
Meredith Grey-ness.

201
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,452
- What are they saying?
- I don't know.

202
00:09:30,554 --> 00:09:32,487
He's making me
deal with his patients

203
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:35,056
while they focus on
what's important: You.

204
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,674
Cristina!

205
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,261
What was I saying?

206
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:42,696
How important it was
to focus on the medicine.

207
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:44,315
Oh, just give me the chart.

208
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,518
We're going to apply a halo
which uses weights and traction

209
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:49,203
to pull your spine
back into place.

210
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:51,473
- Traction?
- Like at the gym.

211
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:55,226
Stretch your body using weights
till the spine pops in position.

212
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,577
Unlike at the gym,

213
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,930
Dr. Shepherd needs to
attach the traction device

214
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,431
directly to your head

215
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:04,035
- by screwing two bolts
into your skull.
- It sounds painful.

216
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,232
Painful is if he
doesn't fix your spine.

217
00:10:06,256 --> 00:10:08,573
Painful is you never walk again.

218
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,630
OK. We going to
do this thing or what?

219
00:10:18,434 --> 00:10:23,470
- Told you not to get emotional.
- I couldn't help it. What now?

220
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:29,293
Go apologize one last time.

221
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:37,718
Once again, ma'am,
we are very, very sorry.

222
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,738
Very sorry.

223
00:10:46,296 --> 00:10:47,762
And now?

224
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:51,816
Now we slowly and
respectfully back out of the room.

225
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,904
Alex, I need a favor.

226
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:59,840
I don't have time for
favors. I'm working here.

227
00:10:59,943 --> 00:11:01,492
Well, what are
you doing at lunch?

228
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,479
According to my interns,
watching Torres kick your ass

229
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,998
- up and down the cafeteria.
- How do they know?

230
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,734
- It's true? What'd you do?
- Nothing.

231
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,786
- Dude.
- - We need a little help here!

232
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,657
Thank God! Somebody I know.

233
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,277
Will somebody please make
sure they page my husband?

234
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,346
- Is that...?
- The Chief's niece.

235
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,765
Camille Travis, 18.
I've tried intubating.

236
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:28,202
Some kind of obstruction.
Sats staying down, 82 percent.

237
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:31,289
- Somebody get me a cric tray!
- How many crics have you done?

238
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:34,092
- Including this one? One.
- It's the Chief's niece.

239
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,360
- Pulse is weaker.
- We better not screw up.

240
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,747
- What are you doing?
- - Trying to help her breathe.

241
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:43,534
She just slit her throat!

242
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,436
I need suction.
Get the retractors.

243
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,455
You didn't hit an
artery, did you?

244
00:11:47,557 --> 00:11:49,673
- No. Not on purpose.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

245
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,826
Get the tube.

246
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:54,328
Oh, God.

247
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,881
- Sats are going up.
- Oh, we did it.

248
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,233
Richard!

249
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,905
What the hell are
you doing to my niece?

250
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,897
The one thing this child did
not need was another surgery.

251
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:17,001
- She wasn't breathing, Chief.
- Didn't know what else to do.

252
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,169
You did the right thing.

253
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:22,640
But Camille was diagnosed with
ovarian cancer when she was 14.

254
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,760
She's had both ovaries removed,
a hysterectomy, and now...

255
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:28,980
- There it is. The mass.
- No wonder she couldn't
breathe.

256
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:32,016
I can take it out, but we won't
know how many more there are

257
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,252
until we do further studies.

258
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,022
I'm so sorry, Chief.

259
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:44,629
She beat it twice before.
She'll beat it again.

260
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:51,368
I just had to tell a 48-year-old
woman that she's going to die.

261
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,273
I wish I could tell a 24-year-old
woman she's going to die.

262
00:12:57,994 --> 00:13:00,428
I have gone out of my
way to be nice to her.

263
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,691
And she talks about
me behind my back?

264
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:06,751
- When were you nice to her?
- I was nice. Once.

265
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:09,803
- My point is...
- Hey, Meredith. Hey, Norman.

266
00:13:09,905 --> 00:13:14,025
- What's up, Lexie?
- Come on, Norman.

267
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:20,898
Dr. Shepherd asked that we
meet in Adam's room in ten minutes.

268
00:13:20,983 --> 00:13:23,584
You could acknowledge
that you heard me.

269
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:25,452
You're using the
Grey sister angle

270
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,388
to get in good
with the attendings.

271
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,140
I get that. But you're
here on my license,

272
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,894
so if you do anything, like
kill someone, it's on me.

273
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:35,246
The rest of the day
you're gonna hug the wall.

274
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,381
Not say anything.
Not do anything.

275
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:41,052
You're an intern.
Are we clear, Three?

276
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,538
Lexie.

277
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:47,558
- What?
- It's Lexie. Or Grey.

278
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:50,795
It's not "Three." I have a name.

279
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,334
Blood tests show
low electrolyte levels,

280
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,047
low calcium and low vitamin D.

281
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:01,221
- Have you been dieting?
- She just lost 40 pounds.

282
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,441
Will told me if I ever got
back down to a size four,

283
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:05,607
we'd move in together.

284
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:08,329
- How romantic.
- We just needed motivation.

285
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:11,649
I told him I wouldn't live with
a smoker, so he quit smoking.

286
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:14,385
The problem is,
even if Dr. Torres

287
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:17,504
is able to repair your fracture,
it won't do any good unless

288
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:21,125
you're eating more, and
working out less. Am I right?

289
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,778
Dr. Torr... Hey,
are you all right?

290
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,964
Uh... Dr. Bailey's right.

291
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:29,100
You won't operate unless
she puts on a bunch of weight?

292
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,568
- No, but...
- Why are we talking about this?

293
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,022
We came here to get her
leg fixed. So fix her leg.

294
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,911
OK.

295
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,597
How did that
discharge-to-hospice patient go?

296
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:44,815
Not great.

297
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,835
There was crying and
tears and more tears.

298
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:50,138
Tears? Really?

299
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:54,074
He's such a tough old bird. I
thought he'd take it like a man.

300
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:57,261
"He'd take it like a man?"

301
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:01,249
- What? I'm sexist now?
- No. "He" as in "him?"

302
00:15:01,351 --> 00:15:04,985
- Joel Hanson in 2212?
- Not Gretchen Bitzer in 2213?

303
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:07,955
Oh, dear. I thought
that two was a three.

304
00:15:08,057 --> 00:15:10,608
Did you and your
intern tell a woman

305
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,304
who came in to have
her moles removed

306
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,461
- that she was dying?
- Oh, dear.

307
00:15:14,564 --> 00:15:16,964
I mean, crap. Oh, crap.

308
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:23,538
Hear that? Like a weight room.
There's nothing to be scared of.

309
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,306
He's been weight
training since he was eight.

310
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:28,559
What did I say about
you and the wall?

311
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,846
Dr. Yang. This is still a
teaching hospital, isn't it?

312
00:15:31,948 --> 00:15:33,097
Yes, sir.

313
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,901
Need to get a closer if you
want to learn something.

314
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:39,353
OK, Adam. I'm going
to attach the tongs now.

315
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:42,607
I need you to stay perfectly
still during this procedure.

316
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:46,727
Let the weights do all the work.
You're going to feel a little pressure,

317
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:48,496
but you shouldn't feel any pain.

318
00:15:48,598 --> 00:15:51,682
All right. Here we go.

319
00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:01,525
Imagine being 14 and having some
doctor tell you you've got cancer?

320
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,894
- What do you do with that?
- You fight.

321
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:06,797
Camille's a fighter. You
two have that in common.

322
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,833
- Hmm.
- What's it going to be?

323
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:12,302
Stevens gets bones broken or
Torres gets taken to the trailer park?

324
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:15,672
It's not happening. But if it
does, will you pull her off me?

325
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:16,858
Tell me what you did?

326
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,643
You have to promise not
to say anything to anybody.

327
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:22,714
- Swear.
- I swear. Jeez.

328
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:28,603
I slept with George.
I'm a terrible person.

329
00:16:28,705 --> 00:16:31,489
Which is why I'm gonna let
her get one good punch in.

330
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,058
Maybe two, I deserve it.

331
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,127
- No, one. Then pull her off me.
- You slept with O'Malley?

332
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,247
- You said you
wouldn't say anything.
- I won't.

333
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:42,132
Believe me. This...

334
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:45,186
I'm embarrassed for you.

335
00:16:45,288 --> 00:16:47,555
You had one job. One
job. Read the charts.

336
00:16:47,657 --> 00:16:49,584
You want to yell
at me some more?

337
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,620
I'm an intern.
According to Dr. Bailey,

338
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:52,921
yelling is how we learn.

339
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,880
- I'm not a good yeller.
- I'm sure it takes practice.

340
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:58,222
Perhaps Miss Bitzer will
show us how it's done.

341
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:01,352
- Let me do all the talking.
- Miss Bitzer?

342
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,770
- Gretchen?
- She left about an hour ago.

343
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:06,240
- She's gone? Left the hospital?
- Mm-hmm.

344
00:17:06,342 --> 00:17:08,760
Feel like yelling now?

345
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:14,548
Your CT results show that
not only is the cancer back,

346
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:18,002
it's spread to your
chest, lungs and throat.

347
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:20,705
We have options
though. We can operate.

348
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,874
We can be even more aggressive
with the chemo and radiation

349
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,677
- than the last time.
- I just want to go home.

350
00:17:29,098 --> 00:17:30,781
We can try to
treat you at home...

351
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,434
No, you don't understand.

352
00:17:33,536 --> 00:17:35,836
I don't want any treatment.

353
00:17:35,938 --> 00:17:38,606
- What?
- - Camille, don't say that.

354
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:42,927
I've tried, Mama. It's not
working. I can't do it anymore.

355
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:46,747
You can and you will.
You have no choice.

356
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:49,767
I'm 18 now, Aunt Adele.
I do have a choice.

357
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:53,588
You may be 18, baby girl,
but you are clearly not capable

358
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:57,675
of making life and death
decisions for yourself now.

359
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,895
- Tell her, Richard.
- No, you tell her.

360
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:04,482
Tell her how the radiation
almost killed me last time.

361
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:08,002
How I got hepatitis and
my kidneys shut down

362
00:18:08,104 --> 00:18:10,621
and my skin was so
raw I couldn't be touched.

363
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:15,092
- Camille.
- I'm dying. We all know that.

364
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:20,047
I don't want to spend what
time I have left in this hospital.

365
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:22,600
I want to spend
time with my friends.

366
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:25,169
I want to sleep in my own bed.

367
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,772
And I want to be home.

368
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:31,926
So, please. Don't be
my doctor right now.

369
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:35,830
Be my uncle who loves me.

370
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:39,366
Let me go home.

371
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,456
Try not to move your head.

372
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:48,392
I'm trying, but...

373
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:51,295
I don't know how much
longer I can take this.

374
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:54,514
You'll take as much as they give
you. Come on, you can do this!

375
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:56,800
- Another few pounds.
- Maybe we should...

376
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,520
- No one asked you.
- I... I can't.

377
00:18:59,622 --> 00:19:01,972
- Please take it off.
- Push through it!

378
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,524
OK, one more plate.

379
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:06,126
You're strong. You can
handle this. Want to be a quitter?

380
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,746
- Do you? Do you?
- That's it. That's 20 pounds.

381
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:13,334
You did it. Right? I
told you, you could do it.

382
00:19:13,436 --> 00:19:16,704
Get him out, please.
Somebody, get him out.

383
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:20,257
- Adam, I'm just trying to help.
- Please get out! Get out!

384
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,427
Calm down. Try not to upset
him. Adam. Adam, calm down.

385
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:26,747
- Adam? It's OK.
- What are you doing? Don't touch him!

386
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:28,599
The slightest movement could...

387
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,752
Put his hand down. Gently.

388
00:19:31,854 --> 00:19:33,286
I'm so sorry. I forgot...

389
00:19:33,388 --> 00:19:35,739
Step away from the
patient and leave the room.

390
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,309
Get out right now or
I will throw you out.

391
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,814
Dr. Grey, take over for
Dr. Yang. Dr. Yang, a word.

392
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,837
You are a resident now.

393
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,390
Your job is to teach
interns, not abuse them.

394
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:55,075
Until you learn to be less
competitive and selfish,

395
00:19:55,178 --> 00:19:58,538
you will not assist on my
surgeries. You will observe them.

396
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:00,301
- But she...
- You can go.

397
00:20:02,351 --> 00:20:05,586
Arlene, she's just tired. She
doesn't know what she's saying.

398
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:09,523
But she's right. She's
not going to get any better.

399
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,226
We don't know that, Arlene.
There's always a chance.

400
00:20:12,328 --> 00:20:14,106
Not if she doesn't
get treatment.

401
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,898
You've got to talk to her.
You... You have to convince her.

402
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,379
She loves you. She trusts you.

403
00:20:20,403 --> 00:20:23,971
She's the closest thing we have
to a child of our own, Richard.

404
00:20:24,073 --> 00:20:28,509
I'm begging you,
please, save our baby girl.

405
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:37,017
Again, Miss Bitzer, it's very
important that you call us back.

406
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,997
You idiots still can't find her?

407
00:20:39,021 --> 00:20:41,505
I called her home,
her cell, her next of kin.

408
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:45,142
I don't care if you have to call
every Bitzer on the planet. Find her.

409
00:20:46,762 --> 00:20:49,046
I am really so very
sorry about this.

410
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,898
It's not entirely your fault.

411
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,150
You're an intern. I
should've checked.

412
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,787
I was distracted by things I
shouldn't be distracted by.

413
00:20:56,889 --> 00:21:00,857
For what it's worth,
Lexie Grey is a good girl.

414
00:21:00,943 --> 00:21:02,475
She's very sweet.

415
00:21:02,578 --> 00:21:06,664
I don't think she would say
anything untoward. Or uncool.

416
00:21:08,818 --> 00:21:12,236
I have Bitzers to call.

417
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:18,025
But you could take
the... Norman? Norman?

418
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,831
- I'm not a bad resident, am I?
- Don't ask. I lost a patient.

419
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:27,184
- You killed someone?
- Lost. Literally can't find.

420
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:30,688
Oh. Shepherd says I'm
selfish and competitive.

421
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,858
What is wrong with that? I kick
ass. I'm an excellent resident.

422
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,628
I'm not. In addition to losing
my patient, I also lost my intern.

423
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,774
Turned around, he
was gone. AWOL.

424
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,416
What's wrong with these
interns? We weren't like this.

425
00:21:42,518 --> 00:21:46,820
- We were great interns.
- I was great. You were good.

426
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,667
- You guys seen Callie?
- No. Ooh!

427
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:52,176
Is it time for her to grind
your bones into dust?

428
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:53,777
You don't think I can take her?

429
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,763
- You really doing this?
- You heard?

430
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,549
- Whole hospital heard.
- That explains the line.

431
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,652
- What are you fighting about?
- You don't want to know.

432
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:04,722
I'm just saying, whatever
it is, it's not worth it.

433
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:08,291
Actually, it is. Some
things are worth fighting for.

434
00:22:13,515 --> 00:22:16,684
- O'Malley.
- Picking up labs
for Ruthie Sayles.

435
00:22:16,786 --> 00:22:19,787
Who's your money on?
Guess you got to back the wife?

436
00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:23,290
- What are you talking about?
- The fight? Torres vs. Stevens?

437
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:24,842
What they fighting about?

438
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:26,393
Oh, Winnie, it's just a rumor.

439
00:22:26,495 --> 00:22:28,746
Callie's way too
mature for that.

440
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,498
That's not what my buddy
in the cafeteria just said.

441
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,438
- O'Malley! Your labs!
- I'll be right back!

442
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,392
I learned how to fight
in a trailer park, OK?

443
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:43,760
Where'd she learn to
fight, boarding school?

444
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,263
Not quite the same thing.

445
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,196
I'm a street fighter. I got some
bad ass in me. I can take a girl down.

446
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:06,967
Izzie.

447
00:23:12,108 --> 00:23:15,309
Punch with your left, protect
your face with your right.

448
00:23:15,411 --> 00:23:18,062
No, protect your surgeon
hands. Your face can heal.

449
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:21,048
<i>♪ Tell me we're
knockers to bite ♪</i>

450
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,011
<i>♪ And out of the
beats of tomorrow ♪</i>

451
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:24,035
Here we go.

452
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:25,830
<i>♪ Tell me what
beat fills the night ♪</i>

453
00:23:25,854 --> 00:23:28,722
Stevens.

454
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:31,241
Let's do this.

455
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:35,262
Let's go. Let's go!

456
00:23:35,364 --> 00:23:38,232
- Go where?
- You know. Go.

457
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:43,554
I wanted to talk.

458
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,640
You want to talk? You
don't want to kick my ass?

459
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:51,111
You thought I was
going to fight you?

460
00:24:14,303 --> 00:24:16,236
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

461
00:24:20,476 --> 00:24:24,094
- A forfeit. Torres forfeits.
- Oh, my God.

462
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,647
You were very ghetto-fabulous.

463
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,449
Oh, my God.

464
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:33,820
- What happened? There a fight?
- No.

465
00:24:33,923 --> 00:24:37,024
Guess they realized they
were fighting over nothing.

466
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:49,253
What do you think is a better
weekend getaway? Napa or Sonoma?

467
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:51,371
Hope you don't mind
if I kill your girlfriend.

468
00:24:51,473 --> 00:24:53,273
First of all, she's
not my girlfriend.

469
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:55,609
Second of all, I mind.

470
00:24:55,711 --> 00:24:58,295
Interns shouldn't
talk to patients.

471
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:01,232
- Well, that's how they learn.
- Which means I have to teach.

472
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,600
I have to deal with their
problems when they screw up.

473
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,869
Meredith rarely screws
up. She's not an intern.

474
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:09,356
- So Napa or Sonoma?
- Sonoma.

475
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:11,658
Smaller hotels, fewer tourists.

476
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,128
And Meredith?
She's still an intern.

477
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,698
Don't kid yourself. She's
green. She's a baby.

478
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,334
The only difference
between her and that old guy,

479
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:23,003
is that you're not
sleeping with the old guy.

480
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,175
- Sorry. I'm late.
- I was explaining the surgery.

481
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,543
Since your bones
have splintered,

482
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:33,126
Dr. Torres will place
metal plates and screws

483
00:25:33,215 --> 00:25:34,842
to hold the ankle together.

484
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,084
- How long will the recovery be?
- Hard to say.

485
00:25:37,186 --> 00:25:40,654
You'll be in a cast
eight to 12 weeks.

486
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:43,307
- Three months?
- Right, Dr. Torres?

487
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:46,260
- Longer if she doesn't eat.
- What? She eats.

488
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:48,590
Not enough to keep
her bones from snapping.

489
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:51,131
- You don't seem concerned.
- What is your problem?

490
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:53,900
I'm not the one who
has to live with you.

491
00:25:54,003 --> 00:25:56,303
- Dr. Torres.
- You do have a problem!

492
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,739
In here. That's good. In here.

493
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:06,396
Ruthie was going
into surgery tomorrow.

494
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,818
That's before she
started vomiting blood.

495
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,802
- She's got a bleeding ulcer.
- How did we not see this?

496
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,581
She came in with a broken ankle.

497
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:17,374
Her malnutrition and the amount
of ibuprofen she's been taking?

498
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:20,394
- She's lucky to be alive.
- Why'd she do this to herself?

499
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,896
People are stupid and
just want to be loved.

500
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,616
It's the only reason
anybody does anything.

501
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:29,303
Asystole!

502
00:26:29,405 --> 00:26:30,904
OK. Start CPR.

503
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:36,877
- You think he'll walk again?
- It's not impossible.

504
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,253
Got a bleeder.

505
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:41,781
I need you to cauterize
the vein, Dr. Grey.

506
00:26:41,884 --> 00:26:43,350
Oh, OK.

507
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,288
I, um... I can't find it.

508
00:26:48,391 --> 00:26:50,990
I can't see where it starts.

509
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:54,127
It's coming too quickly.

510
00:26:54,229 --> 00:26:58,098
Suction around it. You have to see
where the bleed's coming from first.

511
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,851
Follow the flow to the
source. Good. Now bovie it.

512
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:05,739
- Got it.
- Good job.

513
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:08,358
Dr. Yang, if you
don't mind stepping in.

514
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:14,281
<i>- Dr. Boler,</i>
<i>extension 4271.</i>
- Dr. Grey?

515
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,028
Norman! Where have you been?

516
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:19,403
Do you think you can cut out
on me in the middle of a crisis?

517
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:20,570
I went...

518
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,632
Where did you go that
was important enough

519
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:24,741
to disappear in the
middle of a shift?

520
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:28,011
- Miss Bitzer's apartment.
- To Miss Bitzer's apartment?

521
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:31,131
Told her she had a bill
outstanding. She's right behind me.

522
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:34,818
But if I may say so, your
yelling's improved remarkably.

523
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,372
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry I missed your calls.

524
00:27:38,474 --> 00:27:39,923
I didn't mean to
cut out on my bill.

525
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:41,791
It's just, I got a
lot of living to do

526
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:43,427
and not a lot of
time to do it in.

527
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:45,329
- Actually...
- Quit my job.

528
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:48,298
Dumped my boyfriend, told
my boss he could shove it,

529
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,133
and bought a ticket to Iceland,

530
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,802
where the sun never
sets, which is fine by me.

531
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:54,771
I'll sleep when I'm dead, right?

532
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:58,291
You're, uh, not going
to die, Miss Bitzer.

533
00:27:58,393 --> 00:27:59,726
I'm not?

534
00:27:59,828 --> 00:28:03,647
There was a mix-up with
your labs. You're going to live.

535
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:07,334
Hopefully a very
long, healthy life.

536
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,922
I quit my job!

537
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:15,092
I broke up with my boyfriend!

538
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:18,378
I gave up my apartment!

539
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:25,018
Do you know how hard it is to
find an apartment? With parking?

540
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:40,617
I thought you quit smoking.

541
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,182
Wasn't that the deal? Ruthie
loses 40 pounds, you quit smoking?

542
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:47,557
My girlfriend's in surgery.
She'll forgive me for smoking.

543
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:51,895
No. No, she won't
because she's dead.

544
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,182
Ruthie's dead.

545
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,750
Dr. Bailey tried to
stop the bleeding,

546
00:28:57,852 --> 00:29:01,271
but because she's been
starving herself and overtraining,

547
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:03,735
her heart couldn't
take the strain.

548
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,561
You think this is my fault?
She wanted to lose the weight.

549
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:10,564
- I wanted her to be healthy.
- She was healthy 20 pounds ago.

550
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:11,906
You wanted her to be hot,

551
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:15,068
especially if you were
gonna move in with her.

552
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,921
- I loved her.
- You didn't love her!

553
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:21,691
You didn't want to be alone, or
maybe she was good for your ego

554
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,628
or maybe she made you feel
better, but you didn't love her!

555
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,430
Because you don't destroy
the person that you love!

556
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,282
- Callie!
- Get her away from me, man!

557
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:32,814
Give me some excuse to kick
somebody's ass because I'm dying to!

558
00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:36,622
- Dr. Torres! Dr. Torres!
- Don't touch me!

559
00:29:36,725 --> 00:29:40,793
Sir, we are so sorry for your
loss. O'Malley, please take him.

560
00:29:40,896 --> 00:29:44,364
Sir, why don't you
come with me? Come on.

561
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:54,924
I'm going to ask you one
last time, are you all right?

562
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:01,798
- I'm fine. It's nothing.
- Really?

563
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,669
Because "nothing" almost
cost you your career just now.

564
00:30:22,438 --> 00:30:24,604
The mass we removed
from your throat

565
00:30:24,706 --> 00:30:26,940
was so big you couldn't breathe.

566
00:30:29,144 --> 00:30:33,596
Camille, what took
you so long to come in?

567
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:41,004
I knew the cancer wasn't gone.

568
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:46,043
It's never been gone. It's
never going to be gone.

569
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:51,982
And, don't tell my
mom, but the truth is,

570
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:56,837
I was hoping it would kill me
before I had to come back here.

571
00:30:57,756 --> 00:31:01,475
I'm just so tired,
Uncle Richard.

572
00:31:01,577 --> 00:31:05,863
I am so, so tired.

What I have here is a
plan to keep you alive.

577
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:28,502
It involves 12 oncologists,
eight new drugs,

578
00:31:28,604 --> 00:31:32,071
six experimental treatments
from three different continents.

579
00:31:32,174 --> 00:31:35,208
I have no idea if it'll work,

580
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:41,298
but as your uncle, I'm
begging you to take it.

581
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:46,403
Because I know
for a fact, the world...

582
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:51,074
my world, is a better
place with you in it.

583
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:57,114
However, as your doctor...

584
00:31:58,099 --> 00:32:01,100
I promise to do
whatever you want.

585
00:32:03,238 --> 00:32:05,238
I just want to go home.

586
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:09,226

I didn't know that you
wanted to talk to me.

00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:37,765

With George, I...

598
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,483
I'm really sorry.

599
00:32:50,585 --> 00:32:52,519

603
00:33:04,699 --> 00:33:06,933
You took advantage.
He was your best friend.

604
00:33:07,035 --> 00:33:08,668
I tried to trust you.

605
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,237
I'd convinced myself
that it was all in my head.

606
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:14,040
That I was crazy.
But I wasn't, was I?

607
00:33:14,142 --> 00:33:16,176
Then you pull that
in the cafeteria?

608
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:19,062
You humiliate me by getting
in bed with my husband,

609
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:21,998
you have to humiliate
me at work too.

610
00:33:23,318 --> 00:33:26,052
George may be the one
that broke his vows, but you?

611
00:33:26,154 --> 00:33:29,489
We're women, Izzie. You
did this to another woman.

612
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:33,243
You took something from me.

613
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:36,112
You stole something from
me, like a petty little thief.

614
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:38,715
You are the one who
should be humiliated.

615
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:40,662
You are the one who
should be ashamed.

616
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,586
You are the one who should...

617
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:49,892
Don't you dare come
to me for forgiveness,

618
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:51,561
you traitorous bitch.

619
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:05,675
What, I'm invisible now?

620
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:08,478
What do you want?

621
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,582
So you hate me now
too. Well, join the club.

622
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:16,002
You and O'Malley? O'Malley!

623
00:34:16,104 --> 00:34:19,188
What? What is it that I
did that is so horrifying?

624
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,576
- I fell in love, Alex.
- He's married.

625
00:34:23,678 --> 00:34:25,378
Yeah. So?

626
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,631
You're carrying a big old
torch for Ava or Jane Doe

627
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,184
or whatever you call
her and she's married.

628
00:34:31,286 --> 00:34:33,219
So what gives you the
right to judge what I do?

629
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:35,138
Why do you even care?

630
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,008
You told me you
weren't ready yet.

631
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:41,544
After Denny... to
be with anyone.

632
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:44,331
And then O'Malley? O'Malley!

633
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:50,120
Then you tell me, like I'm one
of your chick friends. Come on!

634
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:59,445
Miss Bitzer, I just wanted
to apologize one more time.

635
00:34:59,547 --> 00:35:03,332
Oh, and I just wanted to
say thank you, Dr. Grey.

636
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:07,036
And you too,
Dr. Shales. Bless you.

637
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:08,471
Bye-bye.

638
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,890
- She's not going to sue?
- Nope.

639
00:35:10,992 --> 00:35:12,625
Our lawyer talked
her into settling.

640
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:15,228
Seattle Grace bought
that woman four bedrooms

641
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,697
and three and a half
baths in Reykjavik.

642
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:19,566
- I'm so sorry.
- Tell the Chief.

643
00:35:19,668 --> 00:35:22,852
- I'm writing you both up.
- It wasn't Norman's fault.

644
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,838
He's my responsibility. I'm
the one you should write up.

645
00:35:25,941 --> 00:35:27,941
That's very noble
of you, Dr. Grey.

646
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:31,244
Stupid, but noble.

647
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:39,068
For the record, I don't
think you're stupid at all.

648
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:44,357
- I find you quite smart.
- Oh.

649
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:54,568
What did you say to Camille?

650
00:35:55,604 --> 00:35:56,903
Adele.

651
00:35:57,005 --> 00:36:01,358
I've already lost one baby
and now I have to lose Camille?

652
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,295
I am not going to use Camille
to try and make up for the fact

653
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:08,465
- I never gave you children.
- I never asked you to.

654
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:11,884
I asked you to talk to
her. To convince her to...

655
00:36:11,986 --> 00:36:14,070
I can't do that.

656
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,703
I can't do that, Adele.

657
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:20,410
I can give her all the
options in the world,

658
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:24,080
but I cannot make her
do what I want her to do.

659
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,950
I'm her doctor.

660
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:30,920
I thought being a doctor
was about saving lives.

661
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:35,424
After all these years of
choosing your job over your family,

662
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:40,497
the one time I ask you to do
your job to save this family...

663
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:45,502
Adele, I'm sorry.

664
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:50,790
I'm truly, truly sorry, but...

665
00:36:50,892 --> 00:36:53,592
So am I, Richard.

666
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,620
Callie.

667
00:37:20,722 --> 00:37:24,224
You can't just forgive me.

668
00:37:26,627 --> 00:37:28,995
What I did to you?

669
00:37:30,364 --> 00:37:31,898
It's unforgivable.

670
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,368
That's how it works. That's
what "I forgive you" means.

671
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,956
No, see, I think it means
you don't forgive me.

672
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,437
You don't know
how to talk to me.

673
00:37:42,461 --> 00:37:45,244
Look, you don't... You
can't even look at me.

674
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:49,082
You're so angry that the
only way you can deal with me

675
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,451
is to say you forgive me and...

676
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:54,854
What, we pretend
it didn't happen?

677
00:38:01,729 --> 00:38:04,697
It happened. And
you don't forgive me.

678
00:38:09,604 --> 00:38:11,771
You're right.

679
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,007
I don't.

680
00:38:26,354 --> 00:38:28,487
So, I got Alex to cover for me.

681
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,990
I can leave right after
I round on my patients.

682
00:38:31,092 --> 00:38:34,744
- Have 48 uninterrupted hours.
- Yeah. Um...

683
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:37,280
You know, maybe this
is not a good weekend.

684
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:39,732
What did Lexie say about me?

685
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:42,279
She didn't say anything.
I did all the talking.

686
00:38:42,303 --> 00:38:46,188
- Don't blame her.
- You're friends
with my sister now?

687
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,891
I mean, you talk to the
other Grey about me?

688
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,497
You know what I talked
about with the other Grey?

689
00:38:56,835 --> 00:39:00,053
All the things this
Grey won't let me say.

690
00:39:00,155 --> 00:39:03,656
You can say anything to me.

691
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:07,577
I want to marry you.

692
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:13,899
I want to have kids with you.
I want to build us a house.

693
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:18,071
