1
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:03,797
<i>- Previously on</i> Grey's
Anatomy: - I'm in love with you.

2
00:00:03,821 --> 00:00:05,415
I hope you're in
love with me too.

3
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:07,455
I was named chief resident.

4
00:00:07,557 --> 00:00:09,235
I failed my intern exam.

5
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:12,444
- You can start
from the very beginning.
- Repeat my internship?

6
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,574
- I met a woman last night.
- Hi.

7
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:18,734
- You met a woman
last night?
- I'm Lexie Grey.

8
00:00:18,836 --> 00:00:21,420
- He's gone.
- I can't leave you.

9
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:26,725
- But you're
constantly leaving me.
- It's over. So over.

10
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:42,524
<i>In the practice of medicine,
change is inevitable.</i>

11
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:46,511
<i>New surgical techniques are
created, procedures are updated,</i>

12
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:49,380
<i>levels of expertise increase.</i>

13
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:52,117
<i>Innovation is everything.</i>

14
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,386
<i>Nothing remains
the same for long.</i>

15
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:58,323
<i>We either adapt to change...</i>

16
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,460
<i>or we get left behind.</i>

17
00:01:02,546 --> 00:01:04,930
<i>♪ I can make it on time
if I jump out of bed ♪</i>

18
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:08,634
<i>♪ If I skip to wear clothes
and get running instead ♪</i>

19
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:12,187
<i>♪ I can make it in time ♪</i>

20
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:14,389
I have five rules.
Memorize them.

21
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:18,126
Number one: Don't suck up. I
hate you. That's not gonna change.

22
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:21,013
Trauma protocols, lists,
pagers. Nurses page you.

23
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:24,682
You answer every page at a
run. A run. That's rule number two.

24
00:01:24,768 --> 00:01:26,735
You're supposed to follow me.

25
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,874
Your first shift starts
now and lasts 36 hours.

26
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:36,161
You're grunts, nobodies, the
bottom of the surgical food chain.

27
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,864
Run labs, write orders and work
every second night until you drop.

28
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,433
And you don't complain.

29
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,654
On-call room. Sleep when
you can, where you can.

30
00:01:45,756 --> 00:01:49,691
But not with anybody. Not
attendings. Especially not attendings.

31
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:53,445
Sleeping with attendings,
not a good idea. Where was I?

32
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,898
Um... rule number three.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,735
If you're sleeping, do not wake
you unless a patient's actually dying.

34
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:02,937
Patient better not be
dead when I get there

35
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,023
because not only
will you have killed,

36
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,992
you will have woken
me for no reason.

37
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:08,844
Are we clear?

38
00:02:08,946 --> 00:02:11,379
- Yes?
- That was four rules. You said five.

39
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:15,767
Rule number five:
When I move, you move.

40
00:02:24,962 --> 00:02:26,244
Go!

41
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:29,928
- I hate them.
- You don't. You hate you.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,017
That was hideous.
I feel like a fraud.

43
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:34,002
I rocked it. I think
I'm the new Nazi.

44
00:02:34,104 --> 00:02:37,456
- You are not the new Nazi.
- Meredith, I need
to talk to you.

45
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:39,107
- George. Hi.
- Hey.

46
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:42,060
- How was your vacation?
- Fine. Meredith, could we...?

47
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:46,615
Because mine was... I didn't do
much. Hung out alone. For 17 days.

48
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:48,867
Which is the last
time that I saw you.

49
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:52,621
The day of Cristina's
wedding, which was, well...

50
00:02:52,723 --> 00:02:55,524
Mer and Cristina went on
her honeymoon without me.

51
00:02:55,626 --> 00:02:57,458
Girl-on-girl honeymoon.

52
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,928
Alex took a road trip
to see Ava without me.

53
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,580
I did not go to see Ava.

54
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,015
Rebecca. I didn't see
her. I drove in that direction.

55
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:08,253
Why is everyone so tingly and hurt?
I'm the one who was left at the altar.

56
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,440
I'm fine, by the way.

57
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:13,425
I honeymooned in
Hawaii and I snorkeled.

58
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:17,879
- What did you do, George?
- Meredith, I need
to talk to you.

59
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:22,000
Hey! You want to know... Hey, um,
this is for residents only. No interns.

60
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:23,768
- Yeah.
- Yeah, get out of here!

61
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,515
- Babies.
- Go away.

62
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,689
- 007s in training.
- Seriously.

63
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,985
I guess I should be going too.

64
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,842
No! We didn't mean you.

65
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,844
- I'm an intern!
- What did you want?

66
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,664
Is this how it's going to
be? Bambi has to deal.

67
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:38,283
- At least he came back.
- Cut him slack.

68
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,103
He failed his exam and
got left back in kindergarten.

69
00:03:41,205 --> 00:03:43,321
He wouldn't even look at me.

70
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,092
Have you seen Burke?

71
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:50,395
No. Have you seen Derek?

72
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,431
- No.
- Wait. You haven't seen either

73
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:54,260
- since the wedding?
- Nope.

74
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:57,085
- And you're all fine?
- Yep.

75
00:03:57,187 --> 00:04:00,438
You're either incredibly
healthy or completely messed up.

76
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:09,357
Your interns are
back from holiday.

77
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,800
They're not my interns.
They're residents. I'm free.

78
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:15,637
Right. Well, here, nurse. The
point is, Dr. Yang? The Burke thing?

79
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:18,206
She doesn't know.
I'm supposed to tell her.

80
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:19,774
Burke asked me to tell her.

81
00:04:19,876 --> 00:04:23,010
- Any thoughts?
- Honesty
always works best.

82
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:26,113
That's true. You want to get
together for a drink after work?

83
00:04:26,216 --> 00:04:27,882
- Why?
- Well, I don't know.

84
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:29,317
Might be a good idea...

85
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:31,052
You don't have
anybody to talk to.

86
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:34,689
- No, I have people to talk to.
- Addison is gone. Burke isn't around.

87
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,842
You and Grey aren't smelling
each other in the elevators.

88
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,989
- I have people
to talk to.
- Who?

89
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,329
I have...

90
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:43,531
Chief! I have the
chief to talk to.

91
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:45,934
- Get together for a drink?
- I don't drink.

92
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,503
- Bailey, we need to talk.
- Traumas coming in.

93
00:04:48,605 --> 00:04:51,640
- Avoiding me. We need to talk.
- About choosing Torres to be

94
00:04:51,742 --> 00:04:55,143
your chief resident? Respectfully,
no. We're not going to talk.

95
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:57,812
- Somebody mention
a drink? I'm in.
- Nobody.

96
00:04:57,914 --> 00:05:00,198
- You mentioned a drink.
- I did not.

97
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,019
All right, people. We've got
three MVC's rolling in back to back

98
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:08,306
from a multi-car pile up. We need every
trauma room open and everyone suited up.

99
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,409
- Is there anything
I should do, sir?
- Save lives.

100
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:14,824
No. I mean, as, uh, chief
resident. Anything in particular?

101
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:18,583
Make sure your residents run their
traumas. First day on their own...

102
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:23,839
Where are the residents
you've assigned to this ER?

103
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:26,875
Oh... Oh... I, uh...

104
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,661
I paged them. I
paged them. Bailey?

105
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,430
- What?
- I... I paged Grey, Yang,

106
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:35,366
Stevens and Karev,
but they're not here yet.

107
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:39,420
- When I page them,
they come running.
- Get it together, Torres.

108
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:44,325
Yes, sir. OK, you did not have
to say that in front of the chief.

109
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,144
You asked... boss.

110
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,915
- There's Derek.
- Is Burke with him?

111
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,962
- I don't see him.
- Where have you been?

112
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,887
- We have MVC's due any second.
- We're here, aren't we?

113
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:59,341
Just get ready, OK?
And monitor your interns.

114
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:03,344
One, Two, go get stat packs.
Three, Four, meet the ambulances.

115
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,531
- One and Two?
- I know. I can't
remember their names.

116
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:12,371
- I don't respond to a number.
- George, go wait
for the ambulance.

117
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:14,823
- The rest, come with me.
- Against the wall

118
00:06:14,925 --> 00:06:16,691
and out of the
way unless I call.

119
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,794
OK. This is what's
called a trauma situation.

120
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:23,114
So there's gonna be lots of
activity and a lot of patients.

121
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:27,235
So if you guys have any
questions at all, just ask. OK?

122
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:31,706
I heard she killed a guy
and had to go on probation.

123
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,659
Great. We're stuck with a dud.

124
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:39,247
- Hey. You're
an intern. Again.
- Yeah.

125
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:42,133
- I won't tell anybody.
- That's OK. It doesn't matter.

126
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,369
Do you know which
one is Meredith Grey?

127
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:48,556
Yeah. I haven't told her you're
here yet. I was going to, but...

128
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:51,592
- So you know who I am.
- Yeah, I know who you are.

129
00:06:51,695 --> 00:06:55,664
What's she like? I mean, is she
nice? Because my dad, he won't tell me.

130
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:57,482
- Is she...?
- Excuse me.

131
00:07:01,305 --> 00:07:04,839
- Grey, don't let them
just stand here.
- Let's move, people.

132
00:07:08,244 --> 00:07:12,313
Unrestrained driver, DOA at the scene.
Just need someone to pronounce him.

133
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:15,078
Crap. Dead guy. Why'd you
get me excited with sirens?

134
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,163
OK, who wants to see a dead guy?

135
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,888
Nancy Walters, 34 years
old, 35 weeks pregnant.

136
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,589
Complete upper arm amputation.

137
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,570
Pressure applied. Two
large-bore IVs started.

138
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:26,744
Did he say arm? My arm is gone?

139
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:29,831
Miss Walters, you're gonna
be OK. Grey? Check the wound.

140
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:33,067
I really need my arm.

141
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:37,072
- 45-year-old male, knee injury.
- That guy, the guy that's dead?

142
00:07:37,174 --> 00:07:40,358
He hit a deer and then the lady
hit him and then I hit the lady.

143
00:07:40,443 --> 00:07:42,839
Knee's blowing
up like a balloon.

144
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:45,146
Hey, I'm hungry. Can
I get something to eat?

145
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:49,884
OK, everybody get a good
look? Time of death, 8:22.

146
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,233
Not time of death.
This guy is not dead.

147
00:07:54,257 --> 00:07:56,435
- He was dead!
- He's not dead now! Bag him!

148
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:59,043
We've got a guy who's
risen from the dead.

149
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,045
Get out of the way!

150
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,830
- Are you Meredith Grey?
- Yeah.

151
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:04,643
- I'm Lexie.
- Great. Move!

152
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:07,886
Lexie Grey. I'm...
I'm your sister.

153
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:33,311
That girl out there? The dopey
wide-eyed one? Apparently, we're related.

154
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,997
- You met Lexie?
- You knew.

155
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,494
You knew about it
and didn't tell me?

156
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,369
- I kind of had a lot going on.
- This is trauma room one.

157
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:44,139
As you can see,
it's... There's a trauma.

158
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:46,591
Do you need some help?
Tell me you need some help.

159
00:08:46,676 --> 00:08:50,795
- It's a little crowded in here, Iz.
- - What do you got?

160
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,464
Nancy Walters.
Complete amputation.

161
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,618
Baby looks fine, but she's
having some contractions.

162
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:58,781
- Mind if I take a look?
- Clean cut.

163
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:03,107
You want to rub up against me,
you got to buy me a drink first.

164
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,209
Hang antibiotics
and put on a dressing.

165
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,046
There's a chance of a good
recovery here. Do we have an arm?

166
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:11,282
- They're looking for it.
- My baby has no father.

167
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,683
He's already down two arms,

168
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:16,371
so he really needs
me to have an arm.

169
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:20,342
Get me that arm.

170
00:09:20,444 --> 00:09:23,161
OK, somebody set up for
traumatic effusion drainage.

171
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:25,813
And order him four of morphine.

172
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:29,000
She means one of you.

173
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,929
18-gauge needle, 20-cc syringe.

174
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:32,520
And the damn morphine.

175
00:09:32,622 --> 00:09:36,140
Hey, morphine's cool, but
I'd kill for something to eat.

176
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,927
Healthy appetite after a trauma like
this? That's a very good sign, Joey.

177
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:41,340
- Need surgery?
- Here.

178
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:43,164
Depends on the X-rays.

179
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:54,242
The knee looks good. No surgery.

180
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:02,550
OK. This is Cristina... Dr. Yang.
This is Dr. Yang. She's working.

181
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:05,586
Yep. Saving lives
and taking names.

182
00:10:06,757 --> 00:10:11,042
So I have these interns
and nothing to do.

183
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:14,979
And, uh, I think I'm a really bad
teacher and I think they hate me.

184
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:19,884
And now I'm a fraud, so any chance
you want to let me in on this? Please?

185
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:23,354
Izzie, this guy was dead
and now he's undead.

186
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:27,759
So that kind of makes him like a
zombie. And my personal zombie.

187
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:31,612
So, no, you can't get in on this.
Now go be a fraud somewhere else.

188
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,194
- I don't like you.
- Mmm...

189
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,850
Let's go, people.

190
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:37,712
- Excuse me.
- Where have you been?

191
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:41,155
- I've been waiting for these.
- I got... I met my sister.

192
00:10:41,258 --> 00:10:44,892
For the first time ever which
got me, you know, weird.

193
00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:48,796
So then I got lost on my way to X-ray
because I was all in my head, you know,

194
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:52,133
- about meeting Meredith.
- Meredith is your sister?

195
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:56,404
Meredith Grey. Lexie Grey.
We're half-sisters. So you know her?

196
00:10:56,506 --> 00:10:59,157
- Oh, we need to page
Dr. Shepherd.
- Dr. Shepherd.

197
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,358
He's the neurosurgeon?

198
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,020
OK, somebody page Derek
Shepherd right freaking now!

199
00:11:05,948 --> 00:11:10,001
Grey. Seattle Grace. Thank you.

200
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,570
Hi. How are you?

201
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,374
I have a patient with a severed arm
and no one seems to be able to find it.

202
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,593
- Have you seen it?
- Your severed arm?

203
00:11:18,695 --> 00:11:20,578
No, I haven't. Meredith...?

204
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,982
Hey, I'm so sorry about before. I
was so nervous about meeting you.

205
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,468
Don't block the ER doors.
That was a good lesson.

206
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,004
- You're the girl
from the bar.
- Sorry?

207
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,346
The girl from the bar.

208
00:11:31,374 --> 00:11:33,758
Oh, my God. Yeah.

209
00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:35,794
- Oh, my God! Yeah!
- Yeah.

210
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:38,846
- Oh, my God. You work here.
- Yeah. I do.

211
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,314
The girl from the bar?

212
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,725
I'm the girl from the bar.

213
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:53,878
- She hates me. My sister hates me.
- Meredith is your sister?

214
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,980
- My half-sister.
- Oh.

215
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,116
Hey, you're Dr. Shepherd.

216
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,834
I'm supposed to be
finding you for a consult.

217
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,089
Hey! There you are. I
missed you this morning.

218
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:08,270
Didn't want to be late for my
second first day as an intern.

219
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:12,480
Maybe you can look at it like
this: You have one up on everyone.

220
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:14,849
You're gonna be, like,
the rock star intern.

221
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,218
That's how everyone's
gonna see me.

222
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,221
Or maybe they'll see
you as the Daddy intern.

223
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,239
What?

224
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,126
What did you just say?

225
00:12:26,896 --> 00:12:28,913
I'm not pregnant. I just...

226
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,667
I might be pregnant.

227
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:35,853
Yeah, my boobs are
a little sore which...

228
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,457
I'm trying to cheer you
up, George. This is...

229
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,761
I mean, if I am knocked
up, that's a good thing, right?

230
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:47,343
Callie, I'm just a little
distracted. I'm having a bad day.

231
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,967
OK, you're having a bad month.

232
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,770
OK. Yeah, I'm
having a bad month.

233
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,756
Love you.

234
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:00,094
- Help! We need a doctor's help!
- Your inside voice.

235
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,516
We found an arm in the
road. Here, I bagged that.

236
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,232
That's my arm.

237
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:07,368
Dad! Dad! Tell them she's hurt!

238
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,683
Dad, come on! Tell
the doctor she's hurt!

239
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,241
Any way we can go
with the severed arm?

240
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,009
Is that your blood?
Are you hurt?

241
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:17,373
She's in our truck
and she's not moving!

242
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,441
Please! She's
bleeding really bad!

243
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,666
There's another crash victim!
We need gloves, IVs, gauze,

244
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:26,920
ab pads, trauma gowns.
Still want to baby-sit the arm?

245
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,040
Come on!

246
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,325
Michael!

247
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:35,863
No way.

248
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,400
Is she dead?

249
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:47,325
Michael, this is a hospital
and I'm a people doctor. I...

250
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:50,228
- Can you save her?
- Michael. Come on.

251
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,665
- I'm sorry, but she's...
- Roadkill.

252
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:59,219
She opened her eyes.
Look, she's still alive!

253
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,425
Oh, God, don't
look at me like that.

254
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,325
- Or like that.
- - Go back to the truck.

255
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:15,036
- Please. Please.
- OK. All right. All right.

256
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:17,972
I need a jumbo catheter,
a 16-gauge needle,

257
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:22,226
the biggest Ambu bag you can
find and something that shaves fur.

258
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:29,317
What's the matter with you people?
When I say move, you move. Move!

259
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:36,107
The back of his skull is disconnected
from his first cervical vertebra.

260
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,509
Internally
decapitated. Holy crap.

261
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,228
- 90 percent die in the field.
- The other ten?

262
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,613
I've never seen one.

263
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:46,350
Always a first time? I mean,
he came back from the dead.

264
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:53,774
Henry, I'm Dr. Shepherd. Back of your
skull is disconnected from your spine.

265
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:57,428
I'm gonna try and reconnect it in
surgery. Do you understand me?

266
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,850
Blink once for
yes, twice for no.

267
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,184
Good. I know it's
scary but I promise you

268
00:15:03,286 --> 00:15:05,419
I'm going to do
everything I can.

269
00:15:05,522 --> 00:15:07,204
Do you have family?

270
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,375
All right. We're gonna
contact them, OK?

271
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,061
Let's get him in a
halo. Contact his family.

272
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:16,214
Find out if he's an organ donor.

273
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:24,756
You. Finish the splint,
get him up on crutches.

274
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:29,627
Hey. How's Joey?

275
00:15:29,713 --> 00:15:31,773
He's a hungry hippo
missing a kneecap.

276
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,826
Can't you assign
me something good?

277
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,334
- I don't switch out patients.
- It's not surgical.

278
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,786
- Waste of my skills.
- You're staying with Joey.

279
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:40,582
- Come on.
- No!

280
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,401
Fine. Then I'm going to Bailey.

281
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:45,009
You are a resident.
Go where I say!

282
00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:52,400
- My arm is gone.
- We have the arm

283
00:15:52,502 --> 00:15:55,636
and Dr. Sloan is checking right
now to see if we can reattach it.

284
00:15:55,738 --> 00:15:59,741
- Is there someone
we can call?
- There's no...

285
00:15:59,843 --> 00:16:04,912
No, I just... I just moved
here. I'm all by myself.

286
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:07,426
There's no one. I have no one.

287
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,617
Well, Dr. Sloan should
be here any minute.

288
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,103
I wanted a kid and...

289
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:15,907
I was sick of waiting
for the right guy so...

290
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,309
And my family...

291
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,379
In my family, you don't
go out and get pregnant.

292
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,683
Now I'm alone and
I'm having a baby

293
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:29,185
and I don't have a father for
the baby and I don't have an arm.

294
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:32,557
It's OK. Here's Dr. Sloan.

295
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:37,711
Nancy, I'm happy to report
that your arm is in good shape.

296
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:40,064
Dr. Grey here is going
to clean it up a little

297
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:44,402
and then I'm gonna put that
arm back where it belongs, OK?

298
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,270
OK.

299
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:50,975
OK. We got a 150-pound female

300
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:54,228
with lacerations on
the chest and haunches.

301
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,163
Short breaths. Recommendations?

302
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,227
Doctor? Michael's a big boy.

303
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,979
He doesn't need
make-believe medicine. Right?

304
00:17:01,003 --> 00:17:02,836
It's not make-believe.
She can help.

305
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,833
Michael, enough. I apologize.

306
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,617
- We're wasting time.
- No kidding.

307
00:17:06,642 --> 00:17:09,060
- Michael.
- Please don't let her die.

308
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:11,528
Michael. It is a deer.

309
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,982
We're gonna take her home
and skin her and freeze the meat.

310
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:17,262
- Why?
- Because that's
what you do.

311
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,747
You don't save
them, you eat them.

312
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,938
No, Dad. The
doctor can save her!

313
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,501
- No.
- You don't know that.

314
00:17:22,525 --> 00:17:25,965
My son needs to learn to
grow up and face things.

315
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,914
You're right. I am
not helping him.

316
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,849
I'm helping Bambi.

317
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:35,470
So get me the Ambu bag
and saline. I'm starting an IV.

318
00:17:35,572 --> 00:17:37,121
Thank you.

319
00:17:43,045 --> 00:17:45,179
Still no sign of Burke.
You've got a severed arm.

320
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:48,516
- My arm. Mine. Get away from it.
- Maybe he's not on today.

321
00:17:48,618 --> 00:17:51,151
- Maybe you should
just see him.
- Oh, no, no.

322
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:52,920
If I never see
him, I won't care.

323
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:55,255
I've seen Derek and
Derek has seen me.

324
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:57,625
- And?
- Awkward. Plus he seems
to know Lexie.

325
00:17:57,727 --> 00:17:59,207
- And?
- More awkward.

326
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,723
Your intern is my
half-sister. How weird?

327
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:06,166
I'm trying to save Bambi's life. My
interns think I'm a loser. Severed arm.

328
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:07,968
- Callie's a bitch.
- Word.

329
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:10,871
She won't let me off my patient.
Nothing wrong. He's a nut.

330
00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:13,440
- Severed arm.
- Does anybody know
about deer?

331
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:16,510
- They taste good.
- Evil.

332
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:21,935
George, severed arm. Plus,
Mer's half-sister is my intern.

333
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:25,852
Izzie's playing Dr. Dolittle.
Oh, and Alex hates your wife.

334
00:18:25,954 --> 00:18:28,138
Dr. Sloan's ready for the arm.

335
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,875
- I'll say it. George is being an ass.
- I think it's my fault.

336
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:34,689
I said some things and
now he's not talking to me.

337
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,298
Why is he complaining?
Chick interns are hot.

338
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,550
- He's married, Alex.
- Yeah. He's married.

339
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:42,936
You know who's seriously
hot? That Lexie girl.

340
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,007
Get out. Before I hurt you.

341
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:48,975
I'm going over Callie to Bailey.

342
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:50,811
Callie is over Bailey's head.

343
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:53,147
Spiritually, Bailey's
over everyone's head.

344
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:57,234
Dr. Bailey. How
are things going?

345
00:18:57,337 --> 00:19:00,588
- I wouldn't know. Ask Dr. Torres.
- Miranda.

346
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,122
I don't want to talk.

347
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,292
It is not like you
not to want to talk.

348
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:10,380
- Fine. How's your wife?
- Well, she's... she's good.

349
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,000
I haven't moved back in yet.

350
00:19:13,102 --> 00:19:15,836
She hasn't let me
move back in yet.

351
00:19:15,938 --> 00:19:18,305
She's not taking my calls.

352
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,558
Wait. That's not what
I want to talk about.

353
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,477
Chief resident. We're
gonna have this conversation.

354
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,158
Are you ordering me
to talk to you about this?

355
00:19:26,182 --> 00:19:30,434
- No, I'm not ordering you...
- OK, then. Goodbye, sir.

356
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,666
I talked to the
family. On their way.

357
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,358
I've put an OR on hold.
We don't have much time.

358
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,193
Can I get a progress note?

359
00:19:39,295 --> 00:19:42,296
Uh, do you maybe want
to have a drink later?

360
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:44,648
- What?
- A drink.

361
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,552
Give me one reason
why we can't hang out.

362
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:51,255
- I don't like you.
- Because of Meredith?

363
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,157
I don't like you
because you're you.

364
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:54,708
Hmm.

365
00:19:54,811 --> 00:19:57,511
How is Meredith by
the way? Is she OK?

366
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:01,014
- She's fine.
- She's always fine. That's her problem.

367
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:06,186
We're fine people.
We do fine. We're fine.

368
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:13,844
How's Dr. Burke? I haven't
seen him around. Is he off today?

369
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:17,781
- Here.
- Thank you, doctor.

370
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:21,284
Dr. Burke handed in his letter
of resignation two weeks ago.

371
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:22,853
He wanted me to tell you.

372
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:28,292
- He's gone?
- Sorry.

373
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,895
- Well, don't be. I'm...
- Fine?

374
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:32,429
Yeah.

375
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:57,288
- Circulatory system
of a deer?
- Shut up.

376
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:02,126
Oh... Dr. Bailey, couldn't you use
an extra set of hands in the OR today?

377
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:04,661
I saw an appy on the
board. I'm great at appys.

378
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,997
Torres. She's in charge
of what cases you get.

379
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,401
Hard to set a kneecap
when your patient's in the pit,

380
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:13,671
- don't you think?
- Whatever.

381
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:18,236
- I don't know
how you did it.
- Did what?

382
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,962
Get them to listen to you.
Give you some respect.

383
00:21:26,002 --> 00:21:29,904
Dr. Bailey, you wouldn't
happen to know anything about

384
00:21:30,006 --> 00:21:32,173
the anatomy of a deer?

385
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:38,011
Not my intern, not my
business. Not anymore.

386
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:43,851
Your husband's
injuries are severe as...

387
00:21:43,953 --> 00:21:45,485
They're traumatic
in the extreme.

388
00:21:45,587 --> 00:21:48,389
I'm sorry. What does that mean?

389
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,843
The only thing holding his head
onto his body is skin and muscle.

390
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:56,347
If he moves even a fraction
of an inch, it could kill him.

391
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:58,549
So are you saying that...

392
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:03,137
I'm saying that when you see
him, this could be the last time.

393
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,940
This could be the last
time you see him alive.

394
00:22:12,848 --> 00:22:15,049
Are you in pain, sweetie?

395
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,905
Good. Two blinks.
You aren't in pain.

396
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:24,375
Why isn't Daddy answering?

397
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:27,523
Right now we just need to wish
Daddy good luck in his surgery

398
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:30,330
and tell him how
much we love him. OK?

399
00:22:31,634 --> 00:22:36,887
Because we do. I love
you so much, Henry.

400
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:46,557
What's... What's three blinks?

401
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:49,183
We've only been
working with one and two.

402
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:56,507
Is it I love you? Are you
telling us you love us?

403
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,678
Three blinks is "I love you."

404
00:23:02,731 --> 00:23:06,433
We're gonna be fine, Henry.

405
00:23:06,535 --> 00:23:11,121
You're gonna make it and
we're all gonna be just fine.

406
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,024
It's time to go.

407
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:18,128
OK, guys, let's let these
doctors fix Daddy up.

408
00:23:54,217 --> 00:23:57,150
- George.
- Hey.

409
00:23:57,253 --> 00:24:00,437
George, why are you avoiding me?

410
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:04,541
- I'm on my way to surgery.
- I don't mean
right now. I mean...

411
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:10,247
Not one word in 17 days?

412
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:13,450
I tell you that I love
you and not one word?

413
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,436
- Where have you been?
- Right here!

414
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:17,604
Exactly where I was a year ago.

415
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,959
I'm sorry. I...

416
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:24,578
Sorry.

417
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,725
I'm freaking out.
I'm an intern again.

418
00:24:26,749 --> 00:24:30,033
Yeah, we're all freaking
out. We're all freaking out.

419
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,868
Interns who think I'm crazy.

420
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,322
I might actually be crazy because
day one of me being in charge,

421
00:24:35,424 --> 00:24:37,891
I'm rescuing Bambi.
We're all freaking out.

422
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:40,255
Since when did you
start calling me Bambi?

423
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:43,580
- What? I'm not
calling you Bambi.
- No. I mean, I know. I under...

424
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:46,099
I expect it from
Cristina or Alex. But...

425
00:24:46,201 --> 00:24:49,386
I'm Bambi! I'm
Bambi, George, OK?

426
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,138
If anyone in this situation

427
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,774
is a sad little cartoon
character, it's me.

428
00:24:54,876 --> 00:24:57,945
I'm all alone in the forest.
All alone in the forest, George.

429
00:24:58,047 --> 00:25:01,882
And my mother's been shot
by a hunter, and where are you?

430
00:25:01,984 --> 00:25:03,717
Where the hell are you?

431
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,290
I'm on my way to surgery.

432
00:25:09,392 --> 00:25:13,393
<i>♪ Your tainted heart
My tainted love ♪</i>

433
00:25:13,495 --> 00:25:15,479
<i>♪ Repent now... ♪</i>

434
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:19,282
I really am up for a drink,
you know. If you need to talk.

435
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:22,486
- What would I need
to talk about?
- Meredith.

436
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:25,433
You were lucky, man.
That girl jerked you around.

437
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:29,542
- No idea what
you're talking about.
- Hey, I'm just...

438
00:25:29,644 --> 00:25:33,296
Seemed like you could
use a friend about now.

439
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,999
Meredith's mother
never wanted her.

440
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:39,036
Her father was never around.
She has a right to be damaged.

441
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:41,221
And us together?
It's a big step for her.

442
00:25:41,323 --> 00:25:45,259
Her friend gets left on the altar. She
sees things like this, they don't work.

443
00:25:45,361 --> 00:25:48,662
She panics, she wants this,
she doesn't know how to have it.

444
00:25:48,764 --> 00:25:52,216
Know what? That's not her fault.
Don't talk to me about Meredith.

445
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:56,770
You don't know what you're talking
about. And I don't want a friend.

446
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,129
OK, Nancy. I want you to
count back from 100, OK?

447
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:10,184
- No. No, I am not ready.
- It's just like
going to sleep.

448
00:26:10,286 --> 00:26:13,119
I can't do this alone. I don't
want to be alone anymore.

449
00:26:13,222 --> 00:26:15,172
- I know.
- No, I'm scared!

450
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:18,658
- I know.
- I am scared, Meredith!

451
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,211
I know.

452
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:23,814
I think it's very brave,
what you're doing.

453
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:27,384
It's better to be alone
and feel like a success

454
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:30,838
than to be in a relationship
and feel like a failure all the time.

455
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,239
That's what I think.

456
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,976
So let's just take
care of your arm.

457
00:26:36,078 --> 00:26:38,811
Then we'll deal with
the rest later, OK?

458
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:48,271
Well, looks like I'm
back to babysitting.

459
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:54,139
What the hell? Who took my
clamps? The bandage scissors?

460
00:26:54,163 --> 00:26:57,864
Joey.

461
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:06,189
Foreign body. His abdomen's
rigid. Somebody page Dr. Bailey now!

462
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,192
Go! Come on, Joey.

463
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,034
- You like hamburgers,
don't you?
- Yeah.

464
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:23,489
- Spaghetti with
meatballs and lasagna?
- Mm-hmm.

465
00:27:23,592 --> 00:27:27,060
That's beef. That's
cow you're eating, son.

466
00:27:27,162 --> 00:27:28,428
What do you mean?

467
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,809
Could we have the
circle-of-life lesson later?

468
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:31,943
I need to get in.

469
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:34,301
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

470
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:42,058
Her eyes are glassy.

471
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,178
You. Get in here and
ventilate. Give me this.

472
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:52,518
- We're losing her.
- This is childish
and ridiculous.

473
00:27:52,621 --> 00:27:56,056
It's not. It's not childish to hold
on to hope. It's actually very hard.

474
00:27:56,158 --> 00:27:59,993
Your son wants to believe some
things can work out for the best.

475
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,262
Get me the paddles.

476
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:05,432
- Come on.
- What's she doing?

477
00:28:05,534 --> 00:28:09,602
Insuring we never see the
inside of an OR this year.

478
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:15,759
She's in v-fib. I'm going to shock.
Charge to 300 and stand back.

479
00:28:16,979 --> 00:28:18,762
OK. Clear.

480
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,173
Oh, my God! Oh,
my God! She's alive.

481
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:33,176
It worked. She's OK.
Everything's gonna be OK.

482
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:37,113
Oh, my God!

483
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:44,287
Got a big bleeder. Dr. Grey,
press and hold right here.

484
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,039
She's having contractions.

485
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,119
Take a look.
Probably the stress.

486
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,293
No, these are strong,
two minutes apart.

487
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,206
Call OB and get someone in here.

488
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,530
I don't think
there's time to call.

489
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:57,467
- Her water broke.
- Call Peds. Get a warmer in here.

490
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,453
Baby's coming.
Get her in stirrups.

491
00:28:59,555 --> 00:29:01,188
Reverse Trendelenburg?

492
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:04,641
- Have the nurse press her abdomen.
- - Without jostling.

493
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:09,229
- I'm holding onto
a major artery here.
- OK. Clamp.

494
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:12,749
Scissors.

495
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:16,636
I got it. I got him.

496
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,856
- Great job, George.
- Thanks.

497
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,624
Yeah, we're all heroes.

498
00:29:26,648 --> 00:29:30,233
Now, if no one minds, I'd like to
get this woman's arm sewn on.

499
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:36,205
Like she said,
she's gonna need it.

500
00:29:42,564 --> 00:29:44,814
Starting the fusion now.

501
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:50,454
Did he just move?

502
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:52,722
- Oh, he definitely moved.
- Anesthesia's light.

503
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:55,575
- Yang, stabilize his neck.
- OK. Grab his feet.

504
00:29:55,677 --> 00:29:58,656
Under the drape and do not
contaminate the sterile field.

505
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:03,000
Till he is under. We can't risk
even the slightest movement.

506
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:05,046
You cannot move.

507
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,437
Do you hear me?
This is not an option.

508
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,784
Everything is not gonna
be fine if you move.

509
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,075
It will be the opposite of fine.

510
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:15,657
You cannot leave. The
people you love, they need you.

511
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:19,566
Not just the memory
that you loved them.

512
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:32,746
Anyone care to explain to me
how my patient wound up in this OR

513
00:30:32,848 --> 00:30:36,566
and I wasn't even
informed? Karev?

514
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,118
- Look...
- Dr. Karev didn't page you

515
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,399
because he knows
how to prioritize.

516
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,407
Ten minutes ago
this patient was coding

517
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,894
from a perfed abdomen.
Under the circumstances,

518
00:30:47,996 --> 00:30:50,096
Dr. Karev's quick
thinking is the reason

519
00:30:50,198 --> 00:30:53,500
that your patient
is even still alive.

520
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:57,904
I'll expect a fully dictated chart
before you leave tonight, Karev.

521
00:30:59,124 --> 00:31:02,709
- Jackpot.
- Did he swallow those?

522
00:31:02,811 --> 00:31:05,412
Poor fool, must
suffer from pica.

523
00:31:05,514 --> 00:31:08,815
Uncontrollable urge to
eat any and everything.

524
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:11,184
Check it out. It's
a buffalo nickel.

525
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:14,570
Dr. Bailey. I saw
you were scrubbed in.

526
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,623
I thought I'd stop by.

527
00:31:16,725 --> 00:31:19,859
- See what you've got.
- What I've got?

528
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:24,781
Two dollars and 37
cents, sir. In change.

529
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,301
It's like a cute
festival in here.

530
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:48,522
I delivered that
one an hour ago.

531
00:31:48,624 --> 00:31:53,827
Oh, my God. Well, why aren't
you, like, jumping up and down?

532
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:57,897
I've done this
before! This is déjà vu!

533
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:02,885
Uh...

534
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:06,789
George, you didn't pass your
intern test. You know, it happens.

535
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:10,760
It's nobody's fault. Right?

536
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:14,097
Yeah. Yeah, it's nobody's fault.

537
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:17,178
It's just that Callie gave
Cristina the study cards,

538
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:21,287
Meredith didn't write anything,
Cristina planned a wedding, Izzie...

539
00:32:21,389 --> 00:32:23,656
Izzie just had to...

540
00:32:23,758 --> 00:32:26,009
You know, I'm responsible.

541
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:29,229
I've always been responsible.
I'm not saying "What about me?

542
00:32:29,331 --> 00:32:33,116
When do I get what I want? When do
I get to be someone other than the guy

543
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:35,363
who repeats his
intern year?" But...

544
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:38,121
- But what about you.
- Yeah.

545
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:43,893
I didn't plan on being here.

546
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:46,863
I was all set for an
internship at Mass Gen.

547
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:52,168
And then my mother gets the
hiccups and I'm at a funeral.

548
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,940
We all have problems.

549
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:59,643
Moms die and dads drink so much

550
00:32:59,745 --> 00:33:01,677
they don't even know
what year they're in.

551
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,430
And sisters, I...

552
00:33:03,532 --> 00:33:07,133
I didn't even know there was a
Meredith Grey until a couple months ago.

553
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,537
And she won't... She doesn't
even want to talk to me.

554
00:33:10,638 --> 00:33:13,105
I don't want to be here.

555
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:14,725
You know, I...

556
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:18,161
I'd give anything
to not be here.

557
00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:22,065
You know, to have my life
work out the way I planned.

558
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,369
To even have time to
ask, "What about me?"

559
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:28,721
So you change. You get over it.

560
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:33,593
I'm here now, so...

561
00:33:34,996 --> 00:33:36,729
And you?

562
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:42,102
You delivered a baby today.

563
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:47,023
So stop feeling
sorry for yourself.

564
00:33:54,082 --> 00:33:55,982
You...

565
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,120
are kind of awesome.

566
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:04,257
I know.

567
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,495
Karev, why don't you make sure
Psych's prepared to consult on the patient.

568
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:26,829
Thank you.

569
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:29,382
Whether you like it or
not, we're gonna talk.

570
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,384
- Chief.
- I know you're angry.

571
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,221
No, I'm not angry.
I'm not disappointed.

572
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:36,723
I'm speechless.

573
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,891
I don't want to talk
because I'm speechless.

574
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:43,013
It makes me speechless to
realize you didn't think that

575
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:45,949
I would have made an
excellent chief resident.

576
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:49,903
Right. You would have made
an excellent chief resident.

577
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:53,606
But you'll make an even
more excellent surgeon.

578
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:56,076
You belong in the OR, Bailey.

579
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:00,074
Focus on honing those skills,

580
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:04,784
not on how well you can juggle
schedules or fill out paperwork.

581
00:35:04,886 --> 00:35:06,619
Believe me, I know.

582
00:35:06,721 --> 00:35:09,239
You'll thank me
for this one day.

583
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,409
But not today.

584
00:35:25,574 --> 00:35:28,708
I'm the one that
could use a friend.

585
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:31,361
I said you could use a
friend. I could use a friend.

586
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:34,130
- Mark. I...
- I didn't come
to Seattle for Addison.

587
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:37,683
I didn't come to Seattle to be
chief. I came to Seattle for you. OK?

588
00:35:37,786 --> 00:35:40,186
I came to Seattle
to get you back.

589
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:52,215
I know. I want to take it back
now, but I already said it, so...

590
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:55,218
Yeah. Maybe we
should have a drink.

591
00:35:55,303 --> 00:35:57,954
- We could.
- Yeah. Not today.

592
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:12,068
I know you didn't wake
up expecting this was how

593
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,003
your first day was gonna go.

594
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:18,708
You thought you get to reattach
an arm or observe brain surgery.

595
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,077
Instead, you helped
save the life of a deer.

596
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,680
You can bitch and complain
about it or adjust your expectations.

597
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:26,649
Like it or not,
you're stuck with me.

598
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:30,920
I'm the kind of doctor who lets a kid
convince her she can do the impossible.

599
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:34,586
Plus, when I woke
up this morning,

600
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,821
I thought today was
gonna go differently.

601
00:36:36,845 --> 00:36:39,696
I thought I was gonna
get the good interns.

602
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:42,059
Instead, I get
stuck with the duds.

603
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,384
So I have to adjust my
expectations as well.

612
00:37:45,047 --> 00:37:47,647
- Yeah.

613
00:37:47,749 --> 00:37:49,248
Did you do it by yourself?

614
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:52,535

00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:04,447
It was pretty... He
came out really fast.

617
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:08,601
I had to, uh, you know,
determine the position of the cord.

You know what a
reverse Trendelenburg is?

619

<i>Anybody who tells
you it doesn't is lying.</i>

657
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:58,104
We're broken up.

658
00:41:00,141 --> 00:41:02,124
It's done.

659
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,485
- A breakup kiss.
- A breakup kiss.

660
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:34,641
- I want some breakup sex.
- Yeah. Breakup sex.

661
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:36,926
<i>But here's the truth:</i>

662
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:39,812
<i>Sometimes, the
more things change,</i>

663
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,514
<i>the more they stay the same.</i>

664
00:41:55,463 --> 00:42:00,566
<i>And sometimes, oh,
sometimes, change is good.</i>

665
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:05,989
I love you too.

666
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:10,994
<i>Sometimes, change is...</i>

667
00:42:13,098 --> 00:42:14,563
<i>everything.</i>
