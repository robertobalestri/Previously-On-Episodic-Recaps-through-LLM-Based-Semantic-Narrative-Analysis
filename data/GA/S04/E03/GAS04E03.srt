1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,513
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:05,420
- You're an intern. Again.
- Yeah.

3
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:08,540
- I won't tell anybody.
- Izzie, meet Really Old Guy.

4
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:10,893
This is the best breakup.

5
00:00:10,995 --> 00:00:12,794
Don't know why we
didn't break up long ago.

6
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:14,362
He's gone.

7
00:00:14,465 --> 00:00:17,082
You're my sister. You're
my family. You're all I've got.

8
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:20,218
- We have the same dad.
- We don't have the same dad.

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,087
I think my husband's
having an affair.

10
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,938
I'm going to tell her.

11
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,627
<i>Doctors give patients
a number of things.</i>

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,464
<i>We give them medicine.
We give them advice.</i>

13
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:36,296
<i>And, most of the time,</i>

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,854
<i>we give them our
undivided attention.</i>

15
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:42,207
I heard he saved a guy who
coded yesterday. By himself.

16
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:45,977
He just knows things. He
never messes up in rounds,

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,196
- always has the answer.
- And he's so calm.

18
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,966
I'm always terrified,
but he's, like, steady.

19
00:00:51,068 --> 00:00:54,169
- Best intern ever.
- Who are they talking about?

20
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:57,305
- George O'Malley.
- Seriously?

21
00:00:57,407 --> 00:00:59,307
- Don't they know that he...?
- Shh!

22
00:01:00,377 --> 00:01:02,577
<i>But, by far, the hardest thing</i>

23
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:04,929
<i>you can give a
patient is the truth.</i>

24
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:07,999
Do you know O'Malley's
got these morons snowed?

25
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:10,630
- They don't know
he's a repeater.
- Yeah, whatever.

26
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,494
<i>♪ Take it slow
Take it easy on me ♪</i>

27
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,373
- Hey.
- Hey.

28
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:18,110
<i>♪ Shed some light Shed
some light on me, please ♪</i>

29
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:21,112
- How are you today?
- Good.

30
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,430
Great.

31
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:30,489
<i>The truth is hard.
The truth is awkward.</i>

32
00:01:30,574 --> 00:01:32,341
<i>And very often...</i>

33
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:36,227
<i>the truth hurts.</i>

34
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,580
- Damn it!
- Bye.

35
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,570
She's doing McDreamy. She's
doing McDreamy and lying about it.

36
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:46,538
She thinks I'm weak? Fragile?

37
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,373
Like I can't handle
it because of Burke.

38
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:52,093
- Poor Cristina. All alone.
- Damn right, poor Cristina.

39
00:01:53,998 --> 00:01:55,997
George, what happened?

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,168
<i>I mean, people say
they want the truth.</i>

41
00:02:02,072 --> 00:02:04,305
<i>But do they really?</i>

42
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:09,961
- Do I have sex hair?
- If I did my job right.

43
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,224
- Go ahead.
- What?

44
00:02:11,248 --> 00:02:13,916
You go ahead.
I'll wait a minute.

45
00:02:14,018 --> 00:02:17,886
So this isn't just breakup
sex, this is secret breakup sex.

46
00:02:17,988 --> 00:02:21,156
- Is this about Cristina?
- I don't know what to do.

47
00:02:21,258 --> 00:02:23,302
We don't talk about it,
the whole Burke thing.

48
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:26,394
I want to be a good friend,
I want to take care of her,

49
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:28,608
but you don't take
care of Cristina.

50
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:31,366
OK, so by being with me,
you're cheating on Cristina?

51
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:34,736
- If she knew about
you and me...
- You'd have to talk about it.

52
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:37,706
You'd talk about you and
me. It'd be a long conversation.

53
00:02:37,808 --> 00:02:39,674
There'd be no time
to talk about her.

54
00:02:39,777 --> 00:02:42,543
- I told you,
we don't talk about it.
- Mm-hmm.

55
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:45,647
Pierce, you're in the pit.
James, need you in peds.

56
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,850
- Laura, you're on scut.
- I was on scut yesterday.

57
00:02:48,952 --> 00:02:52,571
Oh, and just for that, you're
on scut tomorrow. Get lost!

58
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,306
Dr. Karev, this is
Dr. Norman Shales.

59
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:58,543
- Hey.
- Strong handshake. That's a good sign.

60
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,378
Norman's transferring
in from UCLA.

61
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,180
I want him to work with you.

62
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:05,484
- Are you the new ob/gyn guy?
- I don't have a specialty yet.

63
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:06,969
Norman is an intern.

64
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:11,456
- You'll be his resident.
- He's my intern?

65
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,676
Don't you worry. This tugboat's
ready to pull his own weight.

66
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:18,330
- Age is just a number, right?
- Absolutely.

67
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,115
A pretty important number.

68
00:03:22,185 --> 00:03:23,705
- Hey.
- Hey.

69
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,638
- You OK?
- I don't know.

70
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,091
I think it's all just
hitting me, you know.

71
00:03:29,193 --> 00:03:30,809
Stupid Burke, dumping me.

72
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:36,681
Then stupid Mama coming
to reclaim her magic necklace.

73
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:43,154
- You want to talk about it?
- No. Not really. Not yet.

74
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,035
If there's anything I can do...

75
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:48,126
You know, I just wish I
had a good bloody surgery.

76
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,329
You know, bloody surgeries
make me feel better.

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,968
One, Two, Three,
Four. Follow me.

78
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:04,258
Joanne, this is why you and I
need to get sick. These doctors.

79
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:06,422
One's more handsome
than the next.

80
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,297
And here comes the
handsomest one of them all.

81
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:11,416
- Hi, Dr. Webber.
- Connie.

82
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,329
He took my appendix
out three years ago.

83
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,171
Barely left a scar. How's Adele?

84
00:04:16,273 --> 00:04:21,126
Um... She's good.
Good. Marriage is hard.

85
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:26,364
But we're dating again... and
she agreed to date me tonight.

86
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:29,450
But... more importantly,
how are you doing?

87
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:32,304
I just had a little bump on
my tongue removed, is all.

88
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:34,889
Couple of taste buds.
It was a touch of cancer,

89
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:37,069
so I'm here to
have the rest out.

90
00:04:37,093 --> 00:04:41,096
I mean, you know, the
cancer. Not the taste buds.

91
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,875
I don't know
exactly how bad it is

92
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:45,139
because Dr. Sloan's been quiet.

93
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:48,169
Because you don't let him
get a word in edgewise, is why.

94
00:04:48,272 --> 00:04:49,704
Uh, how is she, Dr. Sloan?

95
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:52,507
We just got back the
pathology report, Connie.

96
00:04:52,609 --> 00:04:56,494
Unfortunately, the cancer is a bit
more widespread than we'd hoped.

97
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,947
It's over 60 percent
of your tongue.

98
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,833
Well, what does she do? Chemo?

99
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:06,204
I think the best bet is a
microvascular free flap.

100
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,605
Dr. Grey?

101
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,091
He'll remove the
cancerous part of the tongue

102
00:05:10,193 --> 00:05:12,827
and then reconstruct it with
a strip of flesh from your legs.

103
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:15,964
- George?
- Uh, the extra flesh would

104
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,777
provide the bulk
your tongue needs

105
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:19,561
to breathe properly,
chew, swallow.

106
00:05:19,636 --> 00:05:21,669
And talk?

107
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,595
Dr. Sloan? I'll be
able to talk, won't I?

108
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:33,915
You will be able
to talk, Connie.

109
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:37,201
I just don't know how
well you'll be understood.

110
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,473
- It'll be OK.
- It'll be OK.

111
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,126
<i>Nurse Hollister, Peds ICU.</i>

112
00:05:45,228 --> 00:05:46,762
What are you doing in my clinic?

113
00:05:46,864 --> 00:05:48,680
I thought you didn't
work in the clinic.

114
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:52,950
I don't. But I thought I'd get my new
intern, Norman, settled in with you.

115
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,098
Bailey's the best.
You'll really learn.

116
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:56,404
Oh. Pleased to meet you.

117
00:05:56,506 --> 00:06:00,108
You want to leave Norman with
me while you troll for surgeries.

118
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:07,048
The dude's got a bum hip and
he smells like arthritis cream.

119
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,378
He can't keep up.

120
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,935
Come on. Do me a favor
and I'll do you a favor.

121
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,205
I'm calling in my favor
now. Curtain Five.

122
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,676
You can take your intern and
show him how we do an H & P.

123
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:21,563
- Nice to meet you, Norman.
- Thank you.

124
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:25,033
Hunter, I'm Dr. Karev.
This is Dr. Shales.

125
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,768
- What's going on?
- My son is on drugs.

126
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,005
- I'm not on drugs, Mom.
- I wasn't born yesterday.

127
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:33,608
I know the signs.
He's lethargic, irritable,

128
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,771
school work's gone
down the drain.

129
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:39,314
- I'm not on drugs.
- There are a host of reasons

130
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,766
why your son could be
exhibiting those symptoms.

131
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,628
I think we should
run some tests.

132
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:46,037
But first a drug
test, Dr. Shales?

133
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,074
- I'm right to want a drug test?
- Yeah, I just said that.

134
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:51,242
Mrs. Chapman, you are not wrong.

135
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,128
My Mary Beth, God rest
her soul, was just like you.

136
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:56,264
When one of our kids
started heading down

137
00:06:56,366 --> 00:06:59,317
that slippery slope,
she just knew it.

138
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,671
You have a mother's
instinct. Right, Dr. Karev?

139
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,708
Yeah. Right.

140
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:13,731
OK. What happened?
George. It's Really Old Guy.

141
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,945
We could bring a
marching band in here.

142
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:19,404
- What happened with Callie?
- What happened?

143
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,218
You were gonna
tell her last night.

144
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:25,776
I tried, but she would not
let me. She wouldn't let me.

145
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:28,596
And I wanted to kill her,
but then I couldn't kill her

146
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,932
because she did help
me through a lot of stuff,

147
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,767
and it was a lot of stuff.

148
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,571
Then I wanted to kill her again
because who marries someone

149
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:39,457
who just buried their father?
And then I went to bed.

150
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,292
So what does this mean?

151
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:45,008
I told you I needed a
minute before rounds.

152
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:47,415
- We heard you saved
a guy yesterday.
- What?

153
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,484
- Rounds!
- Excuse me.

154
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,548
We'll start in here.

155
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,623
Graziella, what can you
tell us about Really Old Guy?

156
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,675
- He has a name.
- I know he has a name.

157
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,622
We call him Really Old Guy.

158
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,096
Eighty-two year old
semi-comatose male.

159
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:05,750
Came in a year ago status
post fall and is post-op day 352...

160
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,086
Which means he hasn't
woken up for a year.

161
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:10,271
So what's the treatment plan?

162
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,091
Um... um...

163
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:15,660
It's really very simple.

164
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:18,179
Daily labs and dialysis
three times a week.

165
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:21,899
Don't bother with
any more dialysis.

166
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:26,587
I plan to die today, so
it won't be necessary.

167
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,277
Nice to meet you.

168
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,663
And while I think Really
Old Guy is charming

169
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:41,169
in a neglected patient kind
of way, my name is Charlie.

170
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,654
Charlie Yost.

171
00:08:55,652 --> 00:08:57,919
Hey, I just heard. Welcome back.

172
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:59,782
Is it true? Really
Old Guy woke up?

173
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:00,922
He has a name.

174
00:09:01,024 --> 00:09:04,225
This time tomorrow you
can call me Really Dead Guy.

175
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:06,410
I don't think Mr. Yost
knows who you are.

176
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,680
Sure I do. That's Meredith.

177
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:12,383
She and the brain doctor are
always running hot and cold.

178
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,485
And you're Alex.

179
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,805
You still got a thing for
that old patient of yours?

180
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:22,160
I was semi-comatose, Blondie.
I could still hear you guys.

181
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,263
Get a CT, a CBC and chemistries.

182
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:26,665
Your kidneys may be working,

183
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,167
which may be why you
woke up. It's good news.

184
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:32,003
Oh, it just means now I
got two things to do today.

185
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:35,740
- Take a pee and die.
- Nobody's dying. "Aah."

186
00:09:37,193 --> 00:09:39,310
- Functional muscle transfer.
- What?

187
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,947
For Connie. I was reading
up on glossectomies

188
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:42,964
and saw the procedure.

189
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,861
We could microsurgically

190
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,046
reinnervate her
hypoglossal nerve.

191
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,054
A nerve graft? It's too risky.

192
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,257
The free flap's
still your best bet.

193
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:55,655
Even if that goes well, you and I
know she'll never speak the same.

194
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,280
- That woman loves to talk.
- What's a functional
muscle transfer?

195
00:09:59,382 --> 00:10:02,384
You won't find it in the
books. It's cutting edge.

196
00:10:02,486 --> 00:10:05,520
Connect the nerves from the leg
with the nerves from the tongue.

197
00:10:05,622 --> 00:10:08,490
- Gives her a shot
at really speaking.
- If it works.

198
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:10,592
They've only done a
half a dozen of them.

199
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:13,794
Better than none. Sometimes
you got to push the envelope.

200
00:10:13,896 --> 00:10:16,681
Better to do a surgery that
neither of you have done

201
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,634
than do a surgery that you
know at least gives her a chance

202
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:23,504
to have a normal life? Do
you know how to do this?

203
00:10:26,643 --> 00:10:30,711
Are you saying that we're too
old to learn new ways, O'Malley?

204
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:32,093
No.

205
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:34,493
Saying we're old dogs,
can't learn new tricks?

206
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:37,068
- No. I was just asking...
- We're not old dogs.

207
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,304
- We still got it.
- OK.

208
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,624
I did do a functional
muscle transfer

209
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,209
to restore elbow function once.

210
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,212
Elbow, tongue. That's pretty
close. Come on. What do you say?

211
00:10:48,298 --> 00:10:50,798
- Let's light this candle.
- Yes, sir.

212
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,620
- Age is just a number.
- Yes, sir.

213
00:10:58,558 --> 00:10:59,907
Excuse me.

214
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,845
I got Karev down
in the clinic all day.

215
00:11:03,947 --> 00:11:06,281
- I hope that's not a problem.
- Nope.

216
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,750
I know how you like
to be told these things,

217
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:11,219
- so I'm telling you.
- Thank you.

218
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:14,071
You know, he tried to dump
a new intern on me, Karev.

219
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,523
Not interested in teaching.

220
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,459
Thank you for letting me know.

221
00:11:30,006 --> 00:11:33,825
- You ever feel old?
- I'm young. I'm a fetus.

222
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:36,227
You ever feel like
there's going to be a time

223
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,995
when new techniques pass you by?

224
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,915
- I'm a genius and a scholar.
- Shut up.

225
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:45,353
Meredith isn't telling
Cristina about us.

226
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:49,056
And, well, she tells
Cristina everything.

227
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:51,692
- I thought you broke that off.
- I meant to.

228
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,479
You think she's gonna
want to get back together.

229
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:56,658
No.

230
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,182
You think she's going to grow up

231
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:01,286
and get all whole and
want a relationship.

232
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,572
- I do not.
- You're a bad liar.

233
00:12:04,674 --> 00:12:07,842
- You're old.
- I'm just getting started,
my friend.

234
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:17,285
Hey. You feeling any better?

235
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:19,304
Heard you're on that
hemiglossectomy.

236
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,772
Tongue surgery? Yeah.

237
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:24,792
Here I am stuck in the pit
with those know-nothing interns.

238
00:12:24,895 --> 00:12:27,595
You'd think, eventually,
I'd catch a break.

239
00:12:27,697 --> 00:12:31,248
Are we ever going to talk
about this, the Burke thing?

240
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,069
I'm not Izzie. Not going to lie
on the bathroom floor all day.

241
00:12:36,072 --> 00:12:39,374
I'm going to lie
here, on the counter.

242
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,846
I'll trade you the
hemiglossectomy.

243
00:12:45,882 --> 00:12:46,882
What?

244
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,216
You take the hemiglossectomy,

245
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:51,319
and I will take the
ER and your interns.

246
00:12:51,421 --> 00:12:53,537
- Are you sure?
- Take the surgery

247
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,158
if it makes you feel better.
You're starting to freak me out.

248
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:04,148
I saw the whole thing, Yang.
You can stop pretending.

249
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,752
I'm not pretending. I'm
sad. I'm very sad. Me so sad.

250
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,789
I should try it. See if I can
get Grey to take my new intern.

251
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,502
No. Hey. Forget it. Sad is mine.

252
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,086
Go find your own
pretend emotion.

253
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:19,897
Blondie!

254
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:23,334
Hey, Blondie!

255
00:13:25,255 --> 00:13:28,890
Charlie, I have a million
charts to update. I'm busy.

256
00:13:28,992 --> 00:13:30,708
- I want lobster.
- What?

257
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,911
For my last meal.
It's traditional.

258
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,547
The dying man gets to
choose what he wants to eat.

259
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,166
- I want lobster.
- I'm not getting you lobster.

260
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:41,235
You're not dying.
I won't allow it.

261
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:44,138
A man can only hang
on for so long, Blondie.

262
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,908
After a while it's
just not worth it.

263
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:55,349
Don't you have any
friends? Family? Anyone?

264
00:13:55,451 --> 00:13:57,785
They're all dead or
on their way to dead.

265
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:02,440
You'll understand someday.
When you're older. Less naive.

266
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:05,326
- I'm not naive.
- You and what's his face.

267
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,296
That's not naive?

268
00:14:08,398 --> 00:14:11,966
I don't know what you're...
You know about what's his face?

269
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:14,853
I know you're crazy if you
think he's leaving his wife.

270
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,688
Guys always say that.

271
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,524
Not that it's your business,
but this is different.

272
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:23,411
I'm sure it's true love.
I'm sure he's told his wife.

273
00:14:23,513 --> 00:14:25,346
I'm sure he's moved out.

274
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:29,067
And I'm sure all your
friends know. Right?

275
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:33,437
Yeah. By the way,
I want real lobster.

276
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,756
Not that fake whitefish crap.

277
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:39,443
<i>Dr. Pierce, ER stat.
Dr. Pierce, ER stat.</i>

278
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,046
Hey, I'm filling in for
Cristina. So how's it going?

279
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:46,601
Pulled a splinter out of a guy's
toe, now I'm writing about it.

280
00:14:46,703 --> 00:14:49,320
OK. Well, if you
have any questions...

281
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:52,790
I have a lot of questions.
Just not about a splinter.

282
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,858
- OK.
- OK.

283
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,861
Coming through! Forty year old

284
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:59,046
unrestrained driver
in a rollover MVC.

285
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,766
- Lost vitals,
unable to intubate.
- Lexie, let's go!

286
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:05,503
Open the intubation tray.
How long's he been down?

287
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:08,222
Took ten minutes to load
him, 14 to get here, so 24.

288
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,041
Do you know how to intubate?

289
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,292
- Uh, I've never done it.
- You've seen it done?

290
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:14,595
- A couple times.
- Come do one now.

291
00:15:14,698 --> 00:15:16,764
Are you sure?

292
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:19,434
Visualize the cords, pull
straight up, watch the tube,

293
00:15:19,536 --> 00:15:20,784
go through the cords.

294
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,237
I can't see the cords.
You should do this.

295
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,090
You can do it. Just don't
rock up against the teeth.

296
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:29,376
- Just pull straight up.
- Pulse ox's down to 86.

297
00:15:41,624 --> 00:15:42,904
That wasn't bad.

298
00:15:43,593 --> 00:15:44,675
What?

299
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,362
That wasn't bad for
your first intubation.

300
00:15:47,464 --> 00:15:51,049
Is that some kind of a joke?
The guy is dead. He died.

301
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:53,985
He was dead when he came in
here. He was dead on the scene.

302
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,470
He was dead for 15
minutes in the ambulance.

303
00:15:56,573 --> 00:16:00,391
He was dead before I
asked you to intubate.

304
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:04,045
You're pretty cavalier,
don't you think? I mean,

305
00:16:04,147 --> 00:16:05,446
they brought him here for help.

306
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:09,083
They brought him here because
they're legally required to.

307
00:16:09,185 --> 00:16:12,169
And I had you intubate
because I'm required to teach you,

308
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,755
- and that is how you learn.
- No. No.

309
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:17,424
You should have done
everything that you could.

310
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:19,660
That was everything I could.

311
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:22,363
- What kind of doctor are you?
- What is this about?

312
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,770
If you don't want to
learn from me, that's fine.

313
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:31,500
But I have to
cover the pit today,

314
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,002
Why don't you do
both of us a favor

315
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:35,137
and go help
Bailey in the clinic.

316
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,681
- Fine.
- Fine.

317
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:42,667
Pretend I'm not here.

318
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,302
Pretend I'm not
busting in on you

319
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,003
and your pictures of tongues.

320
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,139
Really Old Guy is
giving me a hard time.

321
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,141
I liked him better
when he was sleeping.

322
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,960
Which he's not. He's awake.
You've probably heard.

323
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:55,046
But my point is, is
that he's stubborn.

324
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:58,282
He's stubborn and really old
and he's telling me I'm an idiot

325
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:02,136
for thinking you're gonna
leave Callie. Seriously?

326
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:03,254
We're in this together.

327
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,123
You're going to tell
her tonight. Right?

328
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:10,261
- George?
- I have to
get this research done.

329
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:12,296
You're not gonna tell her.

330
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,616
Just yesterday you said
you didn't want me to tell her.

331
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:17,201
Fine! Forget it!

332
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:21,155
Just play with your
stupid pictures of tongues!

333
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,474
We got back the tox
screen back, Mrs. Chapman.

334
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:24,975
Your son's not on drugs.

335
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,312
You're sure? There's
no drugs in his system?

336
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,709
No, it came back
clean. Your son is fine.

337
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:33,667
This is not my son,
Dr. Shales. It's not.

338
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:35,414
Maybe we should
order more tests.

339
00:17:35,438 --> 00:17:37,449
You know, he's a teenager.

340
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,451
I raised four of them myself.

341
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,387
Teenagers don't
like to do homework,

342
00:17:41,411 --> 00:17:44,478
they talk back to parents and
never come out of their rooms.

343
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:49,249
You have apple hair. I threw a
pancake in the river. A pancake!

344
00:17:50,085 --> 00:17:51,385
Hunter?

345
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:55,288
- Do you know what you said?
- I'm... I'm not sure.

346
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,358
- Did you mean to say it?
- No.

347
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,628
I was trying to say that
I wanted to go home.

348
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,347
- Oh, my God.
- We need to do
a full neuro exam.

349
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,733
Order a head CT and labs. Now.

350
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:10,587
It's going to be OK, you know?

351
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:14,158
- It is. It's going to be OK.
- Do you think so?

352
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,794
Dr. Sloan's going to do
this fancy new surgery.

353
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,629
You'll make it into
medical journals.

354
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:21,015
Maybe you'll be famous.

355
00:18:21,117 --> 00:18:23,557
- What if the surgery doesn't work?
- - Oh.

356
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,636
What if this is my
last chance to talk?

357
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:30,107
I still have so much to say.

358
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,510
- Say it now, Connie.
- Don't be so morbid.

359
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,930
The surgery will
work. You'll be fine.

360
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,149
She should say it
all now, just in case.

361
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:41,185
She shouldn't have
any more regrets.

362
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,772
You can tell us anything,
Connie. We're your best friends.

363
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:54,831
You should tell them.

364
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,962
I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry,

365
00:18:56,986 --> 00:19:00,554
but if you have something you
want to say you should say it.

366
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:02,434
I've been here
long enough to know

367
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,426
that things don't always go
the way that you want them to,

368
00:19:05,528 --> 00:19:08,895
and if there's something you
want to say, you should say it.

369
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,932
Joanne, stop
wearing those pants.

370
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:12,314
Make your ass look like

371
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,279
two puppies are
struggling to get out.

372
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,871
As a matter of fact, all
of your pants are too tight.

373
00:19:16,972 --> 00:19:20,224
You have to buy some new pants.

374
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,646
Elaine, your
breath is god-awful.

375
00:19:22,678 --> 00:19:24,996
- My breath?
- You need to see a doctor,

376
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:30,484
because I know you have good
hygiene, but sweet God, your breath is bad.

377
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:35,388
And you've got to get a new
hairdo. The 80s are over, honey.

378
00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:41,662
- What now?
- He's pulling off
his monitor leads.

379
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,264
I told him he could pull
them off, he's not gonna die.

380
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:45,844
I'm sick and tired of waiting.

381
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:48,108
I'm tired of coming
to your room.

382
00:19:48,204 --> 00:19:52,622
Sorry, Blondie. It's time I
took things into my own hands.

383
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,402
Know what? You want to die?

384
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:55,904
Fine. Here. Let me help you.

385
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,879
You missed this one.
Damn. You're still with us.

386
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:02,483
Oh, wait, this looks promising.
A nice, thick wire. How's that?

387
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:05,219
Any luck? No? Well,
no wonder that's why.

388
00:20:05,321 --> 00:20:09,073
It's attached to this lamp.
OK. Let's see what else we got.

389
00:20:09,158 --> 00:20:10,791
- Dr. Stevens.
- What?

390
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:12,676
- He's not breathing!
- What?

391
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,362
He doesn't have a pulse.
He's in cardiac arrest.

392
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,097
I swear, I didn't do anything!

393
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:20,734
<i>Code blue, fourth floor.
Code blue, fourth floor.</i>

394
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:27,775
- The epi and atropine in?
- Epi's in. Pushing atropine.

395
00:20:27,877 --> 00:20:30,544
Hold CPR, let's
see what happens.

396
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,946
- Looks like v-fib.
- Charge paddles. Three hundred.

397
00:20:33,048 --> 00:20:35,950
Clear!

398
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,887
- No change.
- Charge again. Clear.

399
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,041
We got a pulse.

400
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,877
Charlie?

401
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:49,430
Charlie?

402
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:55,268
Stop saving my life!

403
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:02,242
I can't believe I said all that.
Do you believe I said all that?

404
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,979
- Not really, no.
- Think I hurt their feelings?

405
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,265
I mean, real bad
hurt their feelings?

406
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:10,668
You think they'll forgive me?

407
00:21:10,753 --> 00:21:13,103
You told me. You
told me to tell them.

408
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,490
You told me to say everything.
You said it would be OK.

409
00:21:17,226 --> 00:21:19,193
I'm really sorry.

410
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:26,984
Dr. Bailey? Dr. Grey sent
me down here to work with you.

411
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,686
She did, did she?
And why is that?

412
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,322
Truthfully? Uh...

413
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:34,692
She didn't want to work with
me anymore. She kicked me out.

414
00:21:35,678 --> 00:21:36,994
You can go and tell Dr. Grey

415
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:39,563
that the clinic is not a
dumping ground for strays.

416
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,765
We are not the Island
of Broken Interns.

417
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,417
Please go tell her that.

418
00:21:49,926 --> 00:21:53,593
Please don't make me do that.
I can't work with Meredith Grey.

419
00:21:53,695 --> 00:21:56,096
I can't work with her
because I can't look at her.

420
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:58,393
Because she hates
me, she hates my dad.

421
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,662
She obviously hated
my mother. I am...

422
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:05,572
Please just let me work down
here today. Please, Dr. Bailey.

423
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,709
Kid in Curtain Three
needs stitches. Go.

424
00:22:13,116 --> 00:22:15,932
- What do you got?
- A teenager came in
this morning.

425
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,285
He was lethargic,
irritable, dysphasic.

426
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:19,553
Sorry, I don't know you.

427
00:22:19,655 --> 00:22:24,057
- Norman Shales. Up from UCLA.
- Are you neuro?

428
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,659
I thought I knew
all the neuro guys.

429
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,594
Norman's an
intern, Dr. Shepherd.

430
00:22:27,696 --> 00:22:29,296
- My intern.
- Welcome.

431
00:22:29,332 --> 00:22:30,492
Thank you.

432
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,867
OK. What do we got?
Hmm... Look at this.

433
00:22:33,969 --> 00:22:36,337
The kid's got hydrocephalus.

434
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:37,838
Pushing against
his Broca's area.

435
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,574
Which explains the
screwed up speech.

436
00:22:40,676 --> 00:22:42,009
I was sure it was drugs.

437
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:45,395
That's what happens when
you're a pharmacist for 30 years.

438
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,181
You're sure everybody's
hooked on pills.

439
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:50,284
I won't make that mistake again.

440
00:22:50,386 --> 00:22:53,854
Right. OK. Um, we
need to put in a shunt.

441
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,123
Schedule an OR and
we'll talk to Hunter.

442
00:22:56,225 --> 00:22:58,308
Will do, captain.

443
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,690
The guy doesn't
know when to shut up.

444
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,241
He does it with patients, too.

445
00:23:03,265 --> 00:23:04,981
- You're his resident.
- I know.

446
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,451
But it'd be like yelling
at my grandfather.

447
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:11,972
Hey. I heard about
Really Old Guy.

448
00:23:12,074 --> 00:23:16,010
What's the matter,
couldn't find his LVAD wire?

449
00:23:16,112 --> 00:23:19,029
It was a coincidence.
And he's still alive.

450
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,981
Well, have fun
with Really Old Guy.

451
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:24,618
I'm off to do Meredith's
hemiglossectomy.

452
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:30,635
Has George said anything to you?

453
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,843
She's faking! She's
faking sadness.

454
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:35,662
Pretending to be sad
to steal my surgeries.

455
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,631
OK. I have a really old guy

456
00:23:38,734 --> 00:23:42,036
trying to kill himself
and problems of my own!

457
00:23:42,138 --> 00:23:45,556
So I don't have time for the
two of you and your fake drama.

458
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:56,884
A person wants to die,
you let them. It's polite.

459
00:23:56,986 --> 00:23:59,954
Not in a hospital, it's not.
In a hospital, it's a lawsuit.

460
00:24:00,056 --> 00:24:03,841
- I don't like you.
- Really? I thought
we were BFFs.

461
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:09,329
You know what? Just for
that? I'm dying right now.

462
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:14,546
That might make
you poop your pants,

463
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,851
but it's not gonna make you die.

464
00:24:17,306 --> 00:24:19,672
Damn it!

465
00:24:21,611 --> 00:24:24,428
You really think he's not
going to leave his wife?

466
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:30,601
I think if a person wants to do
something, like die, they do it.

467
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:33,918
Oh.

468
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:41,578
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe there's hope.

469
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:43,614
Maybe he'll tell her

470
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:47,634
and you two will get
together and end up happy.

471
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:51,572
- You think?
- Not that I'll be alive
to see it.

472
00:24:51,674 --> 00:24:55,241
You're not dying,
Charlie. Not on my watch.

473
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:59,129
- Dead Man Walking!
- I don't see much walking.

474
00:25:03,386 --> 00:25:06,987
You know Yang and Grey are
playing musical chairs with the interns?

475
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,373
Oh?

476
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:12,626
I thought that might interest
you, seeing as how one of

477
00:25:12,728 --> 00:25:16,279
Yang's interns is actually
one of Grey's relatives.

478
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:20,066
The two Greys are having
some kind of family feud.

479
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:24,388
I'm just saying it
would probably be best

480
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:28,091
if the residents stuck with
their own interns in the future.

481
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,760
Yeah, I got it. Thanks.

482
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,831
You plan to hide
out here all day long,

483
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:37,484
or you plan to emerge at
some point and do your job?

484
00:25:37,586 --> 00:25:39,348
Why would I come
out there to do my job

485
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:41,972
when you clearly
do it so much better?

486
00:25:42,057 --> 00:25:45,141
I'm doing paperwork because
I don't have more fight in me.

487
00:25:45,227 --> 00:25:47,845
I don't want to fight you,
I don't want to fight my...

488
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:52,482
I don't. I don't
want to fight today.

489
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,218
So I'm doing paperwork, OK?

490
00:26:09,918 --> 00:26:12,569
- Graft's a perfect fit.
- Yeah.

491
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:14,671
It's got good vascularization.

492
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:17,341
You may actually get to
go on that date with Adele.

493
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:20,110
Yeah, I better. Can't very
well have her take me back

494
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:23,012
- if I cancel our first date.
- Where are you taking her?

495
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:26,533
There's a nice little Chinese
restaurant we like to go to.

496
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:29,519
Hmm.

497
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:34,491
- What happens next?
- Um...

498
00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:39,146
- Dr. Sloan, I...
- I know.

499
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:40,547
Is everything OK?

500
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:43,933
Um...

501
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:47,104
- We're not sure.
- What does that mean?

502
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,223
It means we've
never done this before.

503
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:03,770
What about if we coapt the
lingual nerve underneath here?

504
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,106
We'd end up losing
the vascular supply.

505
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,541
The graft might not work at all.

506
00:27:08,643 --> 00:27:13,446
She likes to talk, Sloan.
She likes to talk a lot.

507
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:17,834
We need an extra set of hands.
Someone who knows nerves.

508
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,437
- O'Malley, get Dr. Shepherd.
- Yes, sir.

509
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:26,360
A functional muscle
transfer of the tongue?

510
00:27:26,462 --> 00:27:29,046
Yeah, it was looking
good for a while, but, um...

511
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:31,581
- I'll be right there.
- Yeah.

512
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,486
- Izzie.
- What?

513
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,718
What is there to say, George?

514
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,987
I'm a "Blondie." I'm
the other woman.

515
00:27:43,011 --> 00:27:45,646
- I'm a bad '50s cliché.
- No, no, no.

516
00:27:49,017 --> 00:27:51,484
We're not in this together.

517
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:55,205
Wow. Great. Well, thank
you for letting me know.

518
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:57,257
Hey. No. No, you don't
get to be mad here.

519
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:00,260
- Seriously? We said...
- No, no! There is no "we!"

520
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:02,712
It's just me. I'm the one
who has to tell Callie.

521
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:04,281
I'm the one who
has to destroy her.

522
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:07,267
This is not about you and
me. This is about her and me.

523
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:10,704
I'm ending a marriage
to a wonderful woman.

524
00:28:10,806 --> 00:28:15,192
Me. I'm the one. It's not you.

525
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:16,443
You...

526
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,348
It's not something you
just blurt out. It's not.

527
00:28:25,087 --> 00:28:27,654
I'll do it.

528
00:28:27,756 --> 00:28:29,806
I will do it.

529
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:32,759
You have to back
off and let me do it.

530
00:28:36,064 --> 00:28:38,632
I'm sorry.

531
00:28:38,734 --> 00:28:42,202
You traded? A
hemiglossectomy for the pit?

532
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,603
It's a long story.

533
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:46,506
A story that ends with you
pawning off Lexie Grey on me?

534
00:28:46,608 --> 00:28:48,658
I had her do an
intubation on a dead guy.

535
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,911
It's something you
used to have us do.

536
00:28:51,013 --> 00:28:53,547
I was trying to teach her.
Whatever she told you...

537
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:56,149
- She told me you hate her.
- I don't...

538
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:58,835
- And you hated her mother.
- I didn't say that.

539
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:01,304
Her mother who came to
you with a case of hiccups

540
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,906
and died in our hospital.

541
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:05,070
Do you see where
I'm going with this?

542
00:29:05,094 --> 00:29:07,677
- She's not my intern.
- No, she's your sister.

543
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:11,014
You haven't said a kind word
to say to her since she got here.

544
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:14,217
You were her mother's doctor.
What is she supposed to think?

545
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,853
Whether you like it or not,

546
00:29:16,956 --> 00:29:19,790
your job is to help that
girl be a better doctor.

547
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:21,524
So help her.

548
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,238
- You paged me?
- Really Old Guy?

549
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,782
- Yeah.
- He's checked out AMA.

550
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:28,932
- He's leaving the hospital.
- He can't leave. He's sick.

551
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:31,401
He can barely walk.
And I got him lobster.

552
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,939
- I got a 911. What happened?
- He collapsed.

553
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:38,625
- He started talking nonsense...
- Pupil's blown.

554
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:42,579
Brain's starting to herniate.
We got to get him up on a bed.

555
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:46,316
- What's happening?
- Count of three. One, two, three.

556
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:50,287
- What's happening?
- His spinal fluid's backing up.

557
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:52,889
- Shepherd's not answering.
- Try it again!

558
00:29:53,675 --> 00:29:55,175
What do I do?

559
00:29:55,277 --> 00:29:58,779
Hyperventilation. Mannitol.

560
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:02,448
I don't know everything.
Go get Shepherd. Go.

Dr. Karev.

It might help Mrs. Chapman

571
00:30:28,843 --> 00:30:30,621
- What are you doing?
- Get her out!

572
00:30:30,645 --> 00:30:33,429

573
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:36,566

- Hold his head.

575
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:39,703

I know that you

00:31:07,683 --> 00:31:10,116
I know you feel you
don't have anybody,

583
00:31:10,218 --> 00:31:14,938
but your life's not over.
And... And you have me.

00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,341
You have me. I need you.

585
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,343
I need somebody to talk to.

00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,312
I think you may have
been right before.

00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:24,647

All this time, he was
telling me the truth.

603
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:17,784
Once we get the shunt in, any excess
spinal fluid will drain to his abdomen.

604
00:32:17,886 --> 00:32:19,486
He's going to be OK.

605
00:32:19,587 --> 00:32:20,920
Excuse me.

606
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,041
Sorry I unloaded on you, Norman.

607
00:32:30,065 --> 00:32:32,093
You know how it is,
heat of the moment.

608
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,050
- Don't apologize to him.
- What?

609
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:37,203
- Dr. Bailey's right.
- Shut up. I'm not
talking to you.

610
00:32:37,305 --> 00:32:39,773
He got in your way.
He's been doing it all day.

611
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:43,309
When that happens, when an
intern gets in the way of a resident,

612
00:32:43,411 --> 00:32:45,978
you're not doing what's
best for your patient.

613
00:32:46,081 --> 00:32:48,481
You almost missed
diagnosing that kid today

614
00:32:48,584 --> 00:32:51,684
because Norman thought it
was drugs. So don't apologize.

615
00:32:51,786 --> 00:32:53,066
He should be yelled at.

616
00:32:53,105 --> 00:32:55,205
Dr. Bailey, he's
as old as the hills.

617
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:58,574
I don't care how old he is,
Dr. Karev. He's still an intern.

618
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:01,144
And interns are
basically teenagers.

619
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:03,124
We are not hard on
them because it's fun.

620
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:06,733
We're hard on them because
this is a life and death job.

621
00:33:06,835 --> 00:33:08,151
They need to learn that.

622
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:11,421
There's a reason why we have
a pecking order in a hospital.

623
00:33:11,523 --> 00:33:13,023
It saves lives.

624
00:33:18,897 --> 00:33:23,133
That woman's gonna be able to talk
for the rest of her life, thanks to us.

625
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:25,702
- I think I still got it.
- I think you do, too.

626
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:28,324
We've got to figure out what
you're going to tell Adele.

627
00:33:28,356 --> 00:33:30,323
I forgot about that.

628
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,226
First off, don't tell her
you want to move back in.

629
00:33:33,328 --> 00:33:35,145
- No?
- Reeks of desperation.

630
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:36,991
It's a deal breaker. Trust me.

631
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,500
I can't take this anymore. You
guys are kidding yourselves.

632
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:43,620
You know how close you came
to that woman losing her tongue?

633
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:45,188
To her never speaking again?

634
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,623
Oh, yeah. You were a
couple of cowboys in there.

635
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:51,945
Telling yourselves you can
do this. Acting like the big boys.

636
00:33:52,047 --> 00:33:54,814
You had no business
doing that surgery.

637
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:57,651
No business. Lucky
I came in when I did.

638
00:33:57,753 --> 00:34:00,052
Shame on you. And shame on you.

639
00:34:00,154 --> 00:34:03,473
As for Adele, tell her you can't
imagine your life without her.

640
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:07,077
Tell her for the last month you've
been walking around this hospital

641
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:09,596
just thinking about
her. Tell her the truth.

642
00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:13,332
I'm sorry I called you an idiot.

643
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:20,223
Hey. So I've been thinking
about how you're sad.

644
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:23,309
- And what I can do to help.
- You have another surgery?

645
00:34:23,411 --> 00:34:26,446
- No, that's not what you need.
- It kind of is.

646
00:34:26,548 --> 00:34:29,299
No. What you need
is me. And my time.

647
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:32,035
So I thought we could
go back to my house

648
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:33,987
and get into our pajamas.

649
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:36,267
Just sit and talk
about this Burke thing

650
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:38,336
and get to the root
of your feelings.

651
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,960
Just talk all night
long if we have to.

652
00:34:41,062 --> 00:34:42,895
- Talk.
- Talk.

653
00:34:43,799 --> 00:34:45,865
And cry.

654
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:47,800
Cry.

655
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,336
You know.

656
00:34:50,438 --> 00:34:53,239
You're damn right I
know! Surgery-stealer!

657
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,925
So? Person who's
sleeping with Derek.

658
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,209
How'd you know that?

659
00:34:57,311 --> 00:34:59,980
What, think I'm too fragile
to handle your sex life?

660
00:35:00,081 --> 00:35:04,134
Well, he did leave you at
the altar and I'm your person.

661
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:07,487
How? By protecting me?
That's not how to be my person.

662
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:10,139
That's not what we
do. You know that.

663
00:35:11,126 --> 00:35:14,711
I'm dealing, OK? The best I can.

664
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,780
If you need to take
care of someone,

665
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:19,332
you're gonna need to
take care of someone else.

666
00:35:19,434 --> 00:35:22,802
Fine. But you owe me a surgery.

667
00:35:22,905 --> 00:35:25,071
Yeah, well, you
owe me sex details.

668
00:35:25,173 --> 00:35:27,774
Are we doing this or not?

669
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,459
What are we supposed to say?

670
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,679
- We didn't even know the guy.
- We ate lunch here for a year.

671
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:53,383
The least we can do is say
a few kind words about him.

672
00:36:00,776 --> 00:36:03,743
He...

673
00:36:05,781 --> 00:36:09,632
didn't snore too loudly.

674
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:18,825
He, um... never complained.
And he always took his meds.

675
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,911
- Hardly ever farted.
- Alex.

676
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,413
Fine.

677
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:27,750
He had 12 surgeries this
year and he lived through them.

678
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,503
- That's... That's impressive.
- Thank you, Alex.

679
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:35,891
Cristina?

680
00:36:39,097 --> 00:36:40,930
I got to practice stuff on him.

681
00:36:41,016 --> 00:36:44,100
Central lines and IV,
it was good practice.

682
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,954
Um...

683
00:36:48,056 --> 00:36:51,941
Charlie, the truth is, you
were a bastard. You were.

684
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:56,696
You were mean and
stubborn and just a bastard.

685
00:36:56,798 --> 00:37:01,668
But you were a bastard
who knew what you wanted.

686
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:03,003
And you stuck to your guns

687
00:37:03,105 --> 00:37:05,805
and proved that if you want
something badly enough,

688
00:37:05,907 --> 00:37:08,708
if you're determined
enough and patient enough,

689
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,528
eventually it will
happen. It will.

690
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:18,768
And that gives me
hope, so thanks for that.

691
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,656
Bye-bye, Charlie.

692
00:37:25,427 --> 00:37:27,977
<i>The truth is painful.</i>

693
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,181
It went really well.

694
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:34,667

695
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:37,771
<i>♪ What it said ♪</i>

696
00:37:37,873 --> 00:37:42,175
Your friends, um... I'm so
sorry. I haven't seen them.

697
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:50,716
- How'd she do?
- Great. She did great.

698
00:37:50,818 --> 00:37:54,470
- She's going to talk again?
- Yeah, the chances are good.

699
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:57,507
In that case, we have a
few things we'd like to say.

700
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,560
Your first husband?

701
00:38:00,662 --> 00:38:03,646
He put his hand on my
ass every chance he got.

702
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:04,959
And your second husband?

703
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:07,361
He spat when he talked
and plus he was ugly.

704
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,480
We know that you
thought he was handsome,

705
00:38:09,504 --> 00:38:10,784
but the man was a troll.

706
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:13,472
- That guy you dated last year?
- Comb-over guy.

707
00:38:13,575 --> 00:38:16,509
- My God.
- <i>Deep down, nobody</i>
<i>wants to hear it.</i>

708
00:38:16,611 --> 00:38:19,462
<i>Especially when it
hits close to home.</i>

709
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,548
What?

710
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,268
I have your mother's
death note here.

711
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:28,988
Everything that happened
on the day she died is in here.

712
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,556
And I know because I wrote it.

713
00:38:30,658 --> 00:38:34,144
So, I'd like to go over
it with you, if that's OK.

714
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:36,646
Yeah.

715
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,634
First of all, let me say that
everything that happened

716
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:46,505
that day... every setback,
there was a one percent chance

717
00:38:46,608 --> 00:38:49,692
of each of those things
happening. One percent.

718
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:53,496
And your mother
was the one percent.

719
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:59,953
She came in complaining
of a persistent hiccups.

720
00:39:00,055 --> 00:39:03,056
We did an endoscopic
fundoplication.

721
00:39:03,158 --> 00:39:04,690
You did it endoscopically?

722
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:07,260
So it would be an
outpatient procedure.

723
00:39:07,362 --> 00:39:12,532
We wanted to
avoid major surgery.

724
00:39:12,634 --> 00:39:17,403
For what it's worth, I was very
fond of your mother. She was...

725
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,939
I was very fond of her.

726
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:24,978
<i>♪ And how that made me feel
so sick and bored with myself ♪</i>

727
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:29,649
She got bacterial endocarditis
from the procedure.

728
00:39:29,751 --> 00:39:32,485
<i>Sometimes we tell the truth</i>

729
00:39:32,587 --> 00:39:34,887
<i>because the truth

<i>♪ Friends Let's

731
00:39:40,928 --> 00:39:45,248
I've been having trouble with
this whole pecking order of things.

732
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,333
I've been having trouble.

733
00:39:47,435 --> 00:39:49,418
Because I'm used
to being number one.

734
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,455
But I'm not number
one. Not anymore.

735
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:58,895
So the best that I can come
up with is to be number two.

736
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:02,131
The best damned number
two this hospital has ever seen,

737
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,818
but your number two.

738
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,889
I will... I will...
I will help you.

739
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,725
We'll be like a team.

740
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:17,897
Because, look, girl, you just
seem to be having a hard time.

741
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,500
And, uh, I know I'm
having a hard time,

742
00:40:20,602 --> 00:40:26,489
but together we could do this.

743
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:31,344
I just think we can
do this together.

744
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,141
<i>Sometimes we tell the truth</i>

745
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,533

746
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:40,803

747
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:43,385
You got to reattach
a woman's tongue?

748
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,825
I was there. I didn't
do the reattaching.

749
00:40:45,927 --> 00:40:50,179
Yeah, but still, you're the
intern they wanted on that case.

750
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,098
- He's a repeater.
- What?

751
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,669
Your big hero here, he
was an intern last year.

752
00:40:56,771 --> 00:40:58,704
That's why he knows
some of this stuff.

753
00:40:58,806 --> 00:41:00,557
He's already been through it.

754
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:04,661
But if you want to learn from
someone, really, really learn,

755
00:41:04,763 --> 00:41:08,898
go to a resident. Not this dude.

756
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,605
Well, he's right.

757
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:19,875
If you want to emulate
someone, it's definitely not me.

758
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,278
