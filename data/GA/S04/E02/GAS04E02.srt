00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:03,964

Anatomy: - He's gone.

00:00:03,988 --> 00:00:06,738
It's over. So over.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,542
Dr. Burke handed in his letter
of resignation two weeks ago.

4
00:00:10,628 --> 00:00:14,162
- I was named chief resident.
- I would have made
an excellent chief.

5
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,581
- We're breaking up.
- It was a breakup kiss.

6
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,600
A breakup kiss.

7
00:00:18,702 --> 00:00:21,235
I'm Lexie. Lexie
Grey. I'm your sister.

8
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:22,838
Why are you avoiding me?

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,357
I'm all alone in the forest.
All alone in the forest.

10
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:29,061
- Where are you?
- I love you too.

00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,936
<i>In the hospital, we
see addiction every day.</i>

12
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:42,191
I feel this... this...
this exhilaration.

13
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:44,587
It's like I finally
figured it out.

14
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:48,029
You know, it's like when... It's
like I was sleeping and I woke up.

15
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:51,600
And it's just...
It's just amazing.

17
00:00:53,404 --> 00:00:54,569

18
00:00:54,672 --> 00:00:56,838
<i>how many kinds
of addiction exist.</i>

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,618
This is the best breakup ever.

20
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,059
I don't know why we
didn't a long time ago.

21
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,395
- What are you doing?
- Sleeping.

22
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,880
- No, no sleepovers.
- Yes, come on.

23
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:09,751
- It's three in the morning.
- No. Broken up people
don't sleep over.

24
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:12,515
Sex is the only part of
the relationship that works.

25
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,673
Why screw it up with
everything? Dinner. Conversations.

26
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,643
You're mocking my
severe emotional limitations.

27
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:22,063
I can live without conversation,
meals or sleepovers...

28
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,416
We shouldn't have
sleepovers. You snore.

29
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:29,103
But mockery, I don't
know. That's a deal breaker.

30
00:01:29,205 --> 00:01:31,245
OK. Sex and mockery it is.

00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:32,835
<i>It would be too easy</i>

32
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,060
<i>if it was just drugs and
booze and cigarettes.</i>

33
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:38,062
She said she loved
me and you know what?

34
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:41,934
My dad... Oh, God, he loved
her and... and, you know,

35
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:46,355
when he died, then... I...

36
00:01:46,457 --> 00:01:48,977

<i>I think the hardest part of

38

00:02:17,421 --> 00:02:19,437

Good. Looks good.
You did a good job.

that surgery up there.
- Junkie.

63
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:26,822
Yeah, right, right.
It's good. It's fine.

64
00:03:26,924 --> 00:03:29,991
I'm delegating.
Being a delegator.

65
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:35,008
- What's wrong
with the chief?
- He's a junkie.

66
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:37,515
Him? You're the one
who looks all strung out.

67
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:39,434
- I'm just tired.
- Let me guess.

You and Meredith are up all
night doing the horizontal salsa.

69
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:47,175
Mambo. Horizontal mambo.
Meredith and I, we're just friends.

70
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,578
- Sexy friends.
- You're the most juvenile

71
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,181
- human being I've met.
- The first step to recovery

72
00:03:53,283 --> 00:03:54,666
is admitting you have a problem.

73
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,369
How many nurses you slept with?

74
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:02,123
That's not a problem,
man. That's an adventure.

75
00:04:02,226 --> 00:04:05,093
- It is beautiful.
- It's the Belgian
Flip Round Pro.

76
00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:07,095
- What do you want?
- What do you got?

77
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:09,197
Next projectile vomiter,
I lose your pager.

78
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,278

00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:15,103
Are these all wedding gifts?

80
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:17,672
She's giving them away.
Dibs on the Mixmaster.

81
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:19,552
I'm not giving
you the Mixmaster.

82
00:04:19,576 --> 00:04:21,726
You're supposed to return them.

83
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:25,497
Burke registered for this crap.
Now I'm the one stuck dealing with it.

84
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,393
I'm using it for
professional gain.

85
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:29,395
You're ready to part with this?

86
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:31,085
She's not! I want it. I want it.

87
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,688

the rhomboid flap

88

- You steal this?
- Make her
give me something.

91
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:43,932
- Give her something.
- Mixmaster!

92
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:47,169
Face it. You have
nothing I want.

93
00:04:47,271 --> 00:04:48,991
Would you look at the residents.

94
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:53,408
Big, snazzy residents. Standing
around, playing with housewares.

95
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:57,028

97
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:07,756

this crap and put in my locker.

00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,044

99
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,266
Follow.

100
00:05:19,836 --> 00:05:22,337
- We're not gonna round?
- Carnage trumps rounds.

101
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,923
Write that down.
Carnage trumps rounds.

102
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:28,076
- Callie.
- Oh, hey. I know, I know.

103
00:05:28,178 --> 00:05:30,678
I never made it home. Got
swamped with paperwork

104
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,448
and fell asleep
in an on-call room.

105
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,216
I need to talk when
you have time.

106
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,484
I have no time.

107
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,330

108
00:05:38,354 --> 00:05:42,306
- Later then? Tonight when we're alone.
- Is it serious?

109
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,975
What do we got?

110
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:47,178
Uh, gas main blew in a
building. Five injured. Some badly.

111
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,231
Excellent. Horrible.
It's horrible. Sad.

112
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,905
Marla Kristler, 34-year-old female,
abdomen blown out, skull fracture,

113
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:59,552
third-degree burns over
40 percent of her body.

114
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:01,309
OK, I got this. Open OR Two.

115
00:06:01,411 --> 00:06:03,678

Torres, triage the rest.

116
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,625
Yes. Yang, you're

117
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:07,315
Thank you. One,
Four, come with me.

118
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:10,551
- What about us?
- Uh, go help Bailey
in the clinic.

119
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:18,009
My wife came in another
ambulance. Is she here?

120
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,612
- Straight to surgery. Are you injured?
- No. My son.

121
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,215
Eighteen months old.
Contusion, possible head injury.

122
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,983
BP and pulse are elevated.

123
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,214
- Everything's
going to be OK, baby.
- Karev!

124
00:06:28,238 --> 00:06:30,784
- I'm supposed
to be on plastics.
- I'll take it.

125
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:36,227
- Karev. You're
with the Kristlers.
- What about me?

126
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,740
Were you up late last night?

127
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,398
You look tired. Perhaps
you should sit this out.

128
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,266
I'm fine. Not up late.

129
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:46,104
Went to bed early.
Early and alone.

130
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,406
- Hello, Mr...
- Roche. Archie Roche.

131
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,609
"Age 60, second, third-degree
burns, chest, upper abdomen,

133
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:57,949
Reading the sports section, next
I'm looking up at a hole in the ceiling

134
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,969
- in Dave and Marla's apartment.
- Burns should be débrided.

135
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,939
We'll do a trauma series
and shoulder films. Stevens.

136
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,601
- Got it.
- Where's your pain?

137
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:08,527
Just promise me you'll take
care of Marla and the baby.

138
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:12,246
- Are they your family, sir?
- They might as well be.

139
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,315
How close to the
explosion was he?

140
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:18,352
We were in the living room.
His mom was in the kitchen and...

141
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:21,639
- Did the gas line blow?
- I think it was the stove.

142
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,358
Gonna run some
tests on the baby.

143
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:27,012
Karev, I'm going into surgery
with the chief. Keep me posted.

144
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,329
Marla and David are friends.

145
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:31,299
I was just leaving when
the kitchen blew up.

146
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:33,985
The blast knocked
me into a wall.

147
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:37,555
Have you seen this?

148
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,625
Grim. You guys look grim.

149
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:44,696
Clark, we need to get a CT
just to check for internal bleeding.

150
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:48,533
Internal bleeding? I
was on my way to work.

151
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,906
I need a resident to help me in
the clinic to oversee the new interns

152
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:58,743
- while I'm working
on this patient.
- I'm sorry. I can't help.

153
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:02,113
- You can't help?
- The clinic
is voluntary, Bailey.

154
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,128
I'm not gonna force residents
with this much going on.

155
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,712
You can have as many
interns as you need.

156
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,540
Tell Kent he's got to
find himself another OR.

157
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:14,291
- The chief's taking his.
- OK.

158
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:16,327
- Waffle maker.
- We covered this.

159
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:19,764
- But now I got
something you want.
- Yeah? What?

160
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:27,455
Hello. I'm Jane Burke.

161
00:08:27,557 --> 00:08:29,735
Dr. Burke's mother.
Nice to see you.

162
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,093
I'm looking for a
Dr. Cristina Yang.

163
00:08:32,195 --> 00:08:34,679
Yang, Yang. Let
me see. Dr. Yang...

164
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:38,111
I'll page her. But I
think she's in surgery.

165
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:39,934
I'll wait.

166
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,756
- Waffle maker?
- Fine.

167
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:57,536
- Hey. What's the 911?
- Mama is here.

168
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,716
I'm working with Callie.
Got to find George.

169
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,924
- Your mother? What?
- Not my mother. Mama is here.

170
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:05,093
- George? He's your intern.
- Burke's mom.

171
00:09:05,195 --> 00:09:07,445
Make the synapses
fire more quickly.

172
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,697
I was with a patient.
I'd be happy to go back.

173
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,260
- No, help.
- I'll help.

174
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,145
For Mixmaster and
George's location.

175
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:14,652
Yang, you scrubbing in?

176
00:09:14,737 --> 00:09:16,204
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

177
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,774
Just get rid of
her, OK? Politely.

178
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,426
- What?
- George!

179
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:26,764
Hey. Hey. It's OK. Brian,
I'm here. It's OK, sweetheart.

180
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,866
Brian, stop crying,
baby. I can't think.

181
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:32,737
- Why won't he stop crying?
- Hey there, Brian.

182
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,823
You're a big boy.
Do you work out?

183
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:39,560
You take care of yourself.

184
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:44,365
Dr. Karev. CT results.
Should I page Shepherd?

185
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:47,568
- He's in surgery. Let me take a look.
- What do you see?

186
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,538
- There's nothing acute.
- Nothing? So he's
going to be OK?

187
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,309
Yeah, I'm gonna... I need to
run a couple more tests, OK?

188
00:09:57,414 --> 00:10:00,827
Schedule an MRI and have the
lab run a tox screen on Brian's blood.

189
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:04,936
- Why?
- I said so, Nancy Drew. Just do it.

190
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:09,190
Rooms one and seven are private

191
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:12,093
and should be used for
conversations with patients,

192
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:15,730
not for closed door socializing.
All carts are set up the same.

193
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:19,951
- Memorize where everything is.
- Will we do procedures
on our own?

194
00:10:21,171 --> 00:10:24,622
No, you are interns. You
are in charge of nothing.

195
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:29,009
All procedures will be discussed
and overseen by an upper level,

196
00:10:29,112 --> 00:10:31,562
all charts will be signed
out by an upper level,

197
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,732
and all patients will be looked
at by someone other than you!

198
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,662
And what if...? Ooh! I'm sorry.

199
00:10:36,686 --> 00:10:40,321
I... Sorry. What if
we can't find anyone?

200
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:44,943
Mrs. Burke!

201
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:48,746
What a surprise to see you
here. Are you visiting someone?

202
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:53,601
- You're the maid of honor. Miss Grey.
- That's me.

203
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:57,171
When you stood up in front of
Preston's friends and loved ones

204
00:10:57,274 --> 00:11:02,343
and you said, "It's over,
it's over, it's so over,"

205
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:06,847
were you trying to smash
the hopes of the best man

206
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:08,949
or were you just
trying to be funny?

207
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:13,171
- I...
- Because making light

208
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:16,941
of that situation
would be inappropriate.

209
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:19,644
And to use that moment

210
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:23,314
to send a message
to your boyfriend,

211
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,834
well, that's selfish.

212
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:30,572
So were you being inappropriate

213
00:11:30,673 --> 00:11:33,124
or were you being selfish?

214
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:37,345
I... am...

215
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,765
I apologize for that,
Mrs. Mama. Ma'am.

216
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,571
I'm just gonna go. OK.

217
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:49,857
- Miss Grey?
- Yes, ma'am.

218
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,627
When you report
back to Cristina,

219
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:55,796
would you tell her, please,
that I am waiting for her?

220
00:11:55,898 --> 00:11:59,000
And that I will
continue to wait for her.

221
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:01,086
Yes, ma'am.

222
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:09,276
- Oh! Sorry. Sorry.
- Any news on Marla?

223
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,796
My neighbor?

224
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:15,199
I promise as soon as I hear
something, I'll give you an update.

225
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:23,607
Crap! Sorry. I'm really
sorry. Really sorry.

226
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,111
Three-part proximal
humerus fracture.

227
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,864
Percutaneous reduction
and internal fixation.

228
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:34,051
That boy of theirs,
Brian. Gorgeous.

229
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:37,354
And sometimes
they're not. The kids.

230
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:41,425
Sometimes they're ugly.
You have any kids, doctor?

231
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,678
Not that I know of.

232
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,946
You're not married
either, are you?

233
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:49,467
I'm afraid I haven't found
anybody who will put up with me.

234
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:52,470
Well, get on the stick.
Don't do like I did.

235
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,372
Don't be a bachelor
your whole life.

236
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,258
You can only play
the field for so long.

237
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,095
Then, suddenly, one day,
your whole life passes you by.

238
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,364
Those parts aren't
working like they used to.

239
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:06,350
They have medicine for that.

240
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,570
They don't have medicine
for that all alone part, do they?

241
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,707
No, I suppose not.

242
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:15,910
You got some
pretty ones right here.

243
00:13:16,012 --> 00:13:20,581
I'm off the market, Mr. Roche.
I'm very happily married.

244
00:13:21,518 --> 00:13:24,035
I'm really sorry.

245
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:26,954
Sorry.

246
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,007
You can't tell her.

247
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:37,215
We decided. I was supposed
to tell her. I have to tell her.

248
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,768
No. I know. You can't.
You just... You can't, OK?

249
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,271
I'm working with
her. She's my boss.

250
00:13:43,373 --> 00:13:46,190
- Damn it!
- Shh!

251
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:50,695
Maybe it'll just work itself out
if we wait. You'll grow apart.

252
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,775
- Izzie.
- She's working
long hours.

253
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,866
Maybe she's avoiding
you, having an affair.

254
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:57,385
- Izzie!
- Don't tell her.

255
00:13:57,487 --> 00:14:00,550
How long would you suggest
I wait until I tell her about us?

256
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:02,674
I don't know.

257
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:06,811
At least until she's not in such
a bad mood. A week. A month.

258
00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:09,997
I'm sorry.

259
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:14,785
But... Well, then,
you know... We can't...

260
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:16,587
I know.

261
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,568
Then you better walk away.

262
00:14:23,046 --> 00:14:24,429
I better walk away.

263
00:14:25,515 --> 00:14:28,716
Yeah, I really better walk away.

264
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:32,770
Hey. So George has Clark in line for his
CT and we're waiting on his blood work.

265
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,638
- Grey.
- Yes?

266
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,041
- Grey.
- Yes?

267
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:40,361
OK, I need you to
work in the clinic, Grey.

268
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:41,962
- Well...
- No.

269
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:44,449
Before you tell me the
reasons why you can't,

270
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,150
just let me say this.

271
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:49,554
I need this because
I have idiots.

272
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,155
You understand me, Grey?

273
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,408
Idiot interns are
down there in my clinic,

274
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,045
a clinic dripping with my
blood, sweat and tears.

275
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,380
And I am not convinced,
not at all convinced,

276
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,250
that they will not burn it
down with their ineptitude.

277
00:15:02,352 --> 00:15:04,351
Look... No, I'm not telling.

278
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:08,589
Because I understand I do
not have the authority to tell.

279
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:12,560
So I'm asking. Nicely.

280
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,316
OK, I'm just saying, if I
ever did anything for you,

281
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,285
like, I don't know,
save your life...

282
00:15:22,372 --> 00:15:27,091
If you ever felt you
owed me a debt of thanks,

283
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:30,694
now is when I'd like to collect.

284
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:33,764
Please.

285
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:43,925
Oh, no.

286
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,293
Hey. Are you working
down here today?

287
00:15:46,395 --> 00:15:50,631
- I don't know. I...
- Great! No idea
what we're doing.

288
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:54,418
Plus, I was really hoping we'd
get a chance to speak, so, yay.

289
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,220
Yay.

290
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,511
I can't believe
this. This is surreal.

291
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:05,513
- You're claustrophobic?
- No.

292
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:08,883
I'm not claustrophobic, it's
just... I was on my way to work.

293
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:11,536
On my way to work and
stopped at a friend's house

294
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:15,089
and the next thing you know I'm
in a CAT scan machine. It's like...

295
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:17,074
How did this happen?

296
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,612
- Dr. Karev?
- Baby. It's OK.

297
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,048
Lab work?

298
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,054
- It's crazy, isn't it?
- Stay here.

299
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:34,809
Stay and do not leave. Do not
leave that man alone with that child.

300
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,710
Sweetie. Hey. Hey.

301
00:16:38,815 --> 00:16:42,916
Dr. Yang, was that Dr. Burke's
mother I saw in the waiting room earlier?

302
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:45,402
- Mrs. Burke is here?
- I don't think...

303
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,339
- I wouldn't know.
- How we doing
up there, Shepherd?

304
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:50,324
Good. She's looks
good from my end.

305
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:54,562
It's the best part about the job.
Giving good people second chances.

306
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:57,364
Believe me, I know. I get it.

307
00:16:57,467 --> 00:16:59,199
You know, it's life. It happens.

308
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:03,487
You're going down one path,
and all of a sudden then you realize,

309
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,789
"No, no, no.

310
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:08,860
This is the wrong
path. This is...

311
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,996
No, this isn't the path for me."

312
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,798
And it's good because you learn.

313
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:18,069
And you realize that you
can handle it. And you can.

314
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,354
You can handle this. You...

315
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,274
Clark?

316
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:28,746
Clark! Clark! Code blue!
We need a crash cart in here!

317
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,599
Chief.

318
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:37,021
The one-year-old? Brian
Kristler? He's strung out on meth.

319
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:39,774
- What?
- It was a meth lab
that blew up.

320
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:42,626
This woman and her husband
are running a meth lab.

321
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,262
- Oh...
- Clear!

322
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:54,721
Ah, yes, the joys of surgeondom.

323
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,974
Saving lives for those
who deserve it most.

324
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,311
Tell Dr. Torres to follow
exposure protocol for children.

325
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,714
- I'm counting on her
to take care of this.
- Got it.

326
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:08,085
Sure you don't want to page somebody
to take over so you can go handle that?

327
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:09,920
I'm trying to get
back with my wife.

328
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,723
In order to get back with
my wife, I have to learn to...

329
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,858
Delegate.

330
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,894
Dr. Torres can handle this.

331
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:18,979
- Shooting him up?
- They weren't.

332
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:22,260
When you cook meth, the
fumes coat the walls, the floors.

333
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:25,163
The baby crawls around,
puts its hands in its mouth.

334
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,388
- It gets in his bloodstream.
- God. OK.

335
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,690
Call the police
and social services.

336
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:32,059
What about the
dad? He's still in there.

337
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:35,124
Call the police. They
take care of the dad.

338
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:38,982
You take care of the baby.
Sloan! We got a situation.

339
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:42,836
You're doing a fine job.

340
00:18:42,938 --> 00:18:47,491
You were acting awfully odd
before. Had me a little nervous.

341
00:18:49,746 --> 00:18:52,113
Mr. Roche, I'm gonna
ask you a question.

342
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:54,381
I don't want you
to be offended by it,

343
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:57,100
but the answer could
affect your surgery.

344
00:18:57,203 --> 00:19:00,387
- Fine. Fire away.
- Are you
a crystal meth user?

345
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:02,690
You're kidding,
right? He's, like, 60.

346
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:04,775
No judgment. I need
a yes or no answer.

347
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,060
- Crystal what?
- It's a drug, sir.

348
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:09,796
It's addictive and
very dangerous.

349
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,411
Unless you put it in my
blood pressure medicine,

350
00:19:12,435 --> 00:19:14,719
I've never touched the stuff.

351
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,637
What's going on?

352
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:20,774
The Kristlers had a meth lab in their
apartment. It caused the explosion.

353
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:25,529
Marla and Dave had a
drug lab in their apartment?

354
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:30,017
No. Impossible. Absolutely not.

355
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:32,987
I've known those
two for five years.

356
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:38,458
We've gone on picnics, to
ball games. I baby-sit for them.

357
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,899
I baby-sit for drug dealers?

358
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,668
- O'Malley!
- What happened?

359
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,458
- He coded.
- He coded?

360
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:56,922
Coded. Out of nowhere.
Heart stopped, coded.

361
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,213
- Probably a drug addict.
- What?

362
00:19:59,315 --> 00:20:01,482
I came to tell you.
That fire that he was in?

363
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:04,919
It was a meth lab explosion.
He could have cardiomyopathy.

364
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,673
- That would explain it.
- It's a miracle
I got him back.

365
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:13,744
- You ran the code? Where's Grey?
- She's covering in the clinic.

366
00:20:15,597 --> 00:20:18,532
What is she doing in the
clinic? I told you to take interns.

367
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,834
I didn't want interns.

368
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:28,643
Sorry about that.

369
00:20:28,745 --> 00:20:33,114
Some things, O'Malley, some
things just don't need to be told.

370
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,321
- How about here? Does it hurt here?
- Weird.

371
00:20:40,423 --> 00:20:43,707
- It feels weird?
- No, that lady
is staring at me.

372
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,676
Or my fat.

373
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,812
Don't worry, she's
staring at me.

374
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,599
I'll be right back, OK?

375
00:20:53,903 --> 00:20:56,236
- Well?
- How'd surgery go
on the mom?

376
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,201
She'll live. That's not the
mom I'm worried about.

377
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:03,460
I tried. I tried. Mama is not
budging. And she is very scary.

378
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,046
Yeah, obviously.

379
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:07,798
What does she want?
Did Burke send her?

380
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,484
I don't know. I
mean, you have to go.

381
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:12,286
You have to go deal with Mama.

382
00:21:12,388 --> 00:21:15,872
Just go get it over with. Come
back and tell me all about it

383
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,975
because I could
use a pick-me-up.

384
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:20,538
Mama Showdown is
not for your enjoyment.

385
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:24,849
Besides, my patient is stable and
until I'm paged I'm gonna stay right here.

386
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,918
OK, she keeps staring
at us. Make her to stop.

387
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:29,870
- You.
- You're her sister.

388
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:32,589
I'm an only child.
You're her resident.

389
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:38,362
If you have time to stare, you have
time to get me coffee! So move, move!

390
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,763
Two, stay!

391
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:45,703
Hmm. Now see? If you
could just do that with Mama.

392
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:53,878
<i>Dr. Dell to the NICU.
Dr. Dell to the NICU.</i>

393
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,865
- Mrs. Burke!
- I don't think
I know you.

394
00:21:57,967 --> 00:22:01,852
I'm George O'Malley! I'm a
friend of Burke's. I was Burke's guy.

395
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:05,206
Oh, hi, George O'Malley,

396
00:22:05,308 --> 00:22:08,125
Burke's friend,
Burke's guy. Please sit.

397
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:10,110
I guess I have a minute.

398
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:16,300
One time he let me live on his
sofa when I had no place else to stay.

399
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:19,903
How is he? Is he OK?

400
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,440
He's Preston. He's a gentleman.

401
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,710
And so he doesn't
like to talk about it.

402
00:22:26,796 --> 00:22:31,064
And I just really don't
know what to say to him.

403
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:38,255
Maybe, uh... I don't know.

404
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,757
You could tell him
that he dodged a bullet.

405
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,594
I mean, marriage is...

406
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,546
Once you're in, you're in.

407
00:22:47,716 --> 00:22:50,951
Burke is smart, you know.
He didn't make a mistake.

408
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:54,872
Because a mistake
that, you know...

409
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:59,626
It's hard to take back. Which even
if you want to take back, you can't.

410
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,113
So you can tell him that.

411
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:06,933
"Once you're in, you're in."

412
00:23:08,037 --> 00:23:10,182
Have that engraved
on your wedding ring

413
00:23:10,206 --> 00:23:11,366
when you get married.

414
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,506
I'm already married.

415
00:23:13,608 --> 00:23:16,343
You're already married?

416
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:20,230
George O'Malley,
Burke's friend, Burke's guy,

417
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:24,668
staying in a marriage
out of obligation?

418
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:29,290
That's no way to live.
It's no way to love.

419
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:32,643
But I think you know that.

420
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,730
I do.

421
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,766
Sometimes, I do.

422
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,970
Your timing could not be more
perfect. Where are we going?

423
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:49,955
- What do you mean?
- You paged me, right?

424
00:23:49,979 --> 00:23:52,213
- I did.
- Good. So, on-call room?

425
00:23:52,315 --> 00:23:55,015
I was thinking, maybe,
we could go to the cafeteria.

426
00:23:55,117 --> 00:23:57,484
Thought you might be hungry.

427
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,765
Why are you looking
at me like that?

428
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:02,718
Derek, we agreed. S and M only.

429
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:04,342
- S and M?
- Sex and mockery.

430
00:24:04,426 --> 00:24:07,828
- Right, S and M.
- So you're eating lunch?

431
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,730
I am.

432
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:13,366
- Want to come?
- No.

433
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:16,503
Meet me in the lobby at
8:00. And eat your dinner first.

434
00:24:16,605 --> 00:24:18,271
Yeah. Great.

435
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:23,922
That's a big needle. Do you
have to use such a big needle?

436
00:24:23,946 --> 00:24:26,079
His IV came out and
he needs to be hydrated.

437
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:28,131
OK. OK. Look, I'm...

438
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,167
Look, I'm just freaking
out a little bit here.

439
00:24:30,252 --> 00:24:32,314
Can you give me an
update on my wife?

440
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:35,705
Your wife has a crater in her
abdomen. If she does survive surgery,

441
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,124
it's gonna be a long,
hard, painful recovery.

442
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:41,762
She's gonna be OK, right?
I mean, she's got to be OK.

443
00:24:41,864 --> 00:24:43,574
My wife... Brian, sweetheart.

444
00:24:43,598 --> 00:24:45,093
Look at me. Brian. Stop crying.

445
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:47,262
Brian, please.
Brian, stop crying!

446
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:50,554
He can't stop crying! OK?

447
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,890
He can't stop crying because
his nervous system is shot.

448
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,926
Because his brain and his
heart and his renal system

449
00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:00,597
are all compromised. He can't stop
crying because he's in withdrawal

450
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,033
from crystal meth,
you son of a bitch.

451
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:09,189
No, no. That's impossible. He wasn't
in the room when we were making it!

452
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,058
It was all over your
apartment, OK?

453
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,543
I tested him because
I smelled it on his skin.

454
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,897
I love my son. OK.
We were broke.

455
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:19,466
I lost my job, but
I don't use drugs!

456
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:22,302
And I'm a good dad
and I love my family!

457
00:25:22,404 --> 00:25:25,456
Well, now you can
love your family from jail.

458
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:33,446
It's all right. Come on.

459
00:25:34,216 --> 00:25:35,849
I'm sorry.

460
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:50,898
- Dr. Torres.
- Yeah, chief?

461
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,099
"Yeah, chief"?

462
00:25:52,201 --> 00:25:53,534
Is it that you don't know

463
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:56,119
what's going on in
my hospital, Dr. Torres,

464
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,038
or that you don't care?

465
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,168
Um, I'm sorry. I
guess I don't know.

466
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:02,559
I delegated the meth
lab situation to you.

467
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:06,313
And now one of your residents has
been attacked and a baby is missing.

468
00:26:06,415 --> 00:26:08,849
- I don't understand...
- I don't want excuses.

469
00:26:08,951 --> 00:26:13,670
Finish up here. You better
hope that baby shows up.

470
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:30,436
- I think you're a good chief resident.
- - What?

471
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:33,207
I know that you've been
having a hard time with it,

472
00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:37,160
and this thing with the baby,
clearly, it's not an easy job

473
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,597
and I think you're
doing a good job at it.

474
00:26:53,795 --> 00:26:56,113
- I can take it from here.
- What?

475
00:26:56,215 --> 00:27:00,200
Get out of my OR, Stevens. Now!

476
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:06,623
So the happy little
family makes meth?

477
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,470
There's no such thing
as a happy family.

478
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,696
What's with her?

479
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,265
Well, Mama Burke is here
and we don't know why.

480
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,201
My guess is that she's
here to kill Cristina.

481
00:27:20,189 --> 00:27:22,989
She's hovering again.

482
00:27:23,091 --> 00:27:26,810
If you're done with the charts,
go fold something. Like sheets.

483
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:32,552
What are you looking
at? Don't look at her.

484
00:27:32,634 --> 00:27:35,235
- Your sister, she's hot.
- I'm an only child.

485
00:27:35,337 --> 00:27:37,099
Don't talk to me about Lexie.

486
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:40,224
Oh, the police
want to talk to me.

487
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:44,161
All I want to know is why she's
here. Is that too much to ask?

488
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:48,315
Hey.

489
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,650
Aah...

490
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,287
He's not returning my
phone calls anymore.

491
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:56,923
- He's doing his best.
- Mmm.

492
00:27:57,643 --> 00:27:59,877
Do you think...?

493
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:03,897
Do you think she really
loved him? Cristina?

494
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:07,200
I think she loved him the
best that she knew how.

495
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:11,071
That would not have
been enough for you either?

496
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:14,402
No. No, it wouldn't have
been enough for me either.

497
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,443
So you would have ended it too?

498
00:28:20,633 --> 00:28:24,250
Well, Burke and I
are built differently.

499
00:28:24,353 --> 00:28:26,687
He's stronger than I am.

500
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,206
He was strong enough to...

501
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:31,788
And we're not built the same.

502
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,278
Honorable men are
all built the same.

503
00:28:35,364 --> 00:28:40,050
- And you think
I'm an honorable man.
- Do you know when to walk away?

504
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:43,737
Do you know when not to
take less than you deserve?

505
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:47,574
If you do, then you're
an honorable man.

506
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:53,830
When you got injured in the
fire, the shock to your body,

507
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,899
combined with the
drugs and the damage,

508
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:59,102
your heart seized up and
you went into cardiac arrest.

509
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:03,273
You are also bleeding internally,
so you need to stay for observation.

510
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:07,394
Which means that you are
probably about to go into withdrawal.

511
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:12,315
But you can't leave because it is still
quite possible that you'll need surgery.

512
00:29:14,202 --> 00:29:16,703
You got any good
news, Dr. O'Malley?

513
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:20,306
I wish I could say yes.

514
00:29:24,246 --> 00:29:27,664
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on.

515
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,716
Where are you? Damn it!

516
00:29:29,818 --> 00:29:33,519
- How's the surgery
on the old guy?
- Fine.

517
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:35,255
- Callie.
- Damn. Can't talk now.

518
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,557
- I have to find a baby.
- Are you OK?

519
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:40,460
A baby was lost on my watch.

520
00:29:40,562 --> 00:29:42,329
I am chief resident.
I am responsible.

521
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,430
The chief gave this
to me and I blew it,

522
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,133
and now a baby's
missing, so no, I'm not OK!

523
00:29:47,236 --> 00:29:49,802
No.

524
00:29:49,904 --> 00:29:52,071
No, you are not OK.

525
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:58,228
Plus, I think...

526
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,681
I think my husband's
having an affair.

527
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:06,472
If that's true, he's an idiot.

528
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,891
If that's true, you
need to talk to him.

529
00:30:11,993 --> 00:30:16,746
You know, as an alternative
to destroying your career.

530
00:30:22,538 --> 00:30:24,605
Um... Dr. Grey.

531
00:30:24,707 --> 00:30:27,941
I was wondering, do you know
where the thermometers are 'cause...?

532
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:30,321
Do you not know where
the thermometers are

533
00:30:30,345 --> 00:30:32,523
or are you looking
for an excuse to talk?

534
00:30:32,547 --> 00:30:34,531
- I...
- Simple question, Lexie.

535
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:37,073
Are you an idiot or a stalker?

536
00:30:40,322 --> 00:30:43,657
OK. That was a
mean thing to say.

537
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,427
I'm aware of that because I'm
generally not a mean person.

538
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:50,197
But I'm a person who just
doesn't want to know you.

539
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:53,227
And you are a person who's
making that very difficult.

540
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:59,156
So please, just stop making it so
difficult for me to not know you, OK?

541
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,267
Oh, my God! Brian! Brian!

542
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:15,138
Please wake up, baby.
Please. Please wake up.

543
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:19,042
- Mr. Kristler.
- He won't wake up.

544
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:21,739
He was shaking and then
he just... He won't wake up.

545
00:31:21,763 --> 00:31:24,208
- Let me take him,
Mr. Kristler.
- No. I love my baby.

546
00:31:24,232 --> 00:31:26,661
- I don't want
to leave my baby.
- A seizure.

547
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:28,696
- Please.
- I don't want
to go to jail.

548
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,220
If you love him,
let me take him.

549
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,422
- It's going to be OK.
- I'm sorry.

550
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:34,440
- Nurse!
- Baby. Please.

551
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:46,536
He had a stroke. A one
year old with a stroke.

552
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:52,409
- You can yell, you know.
- Not my job anymore.

553
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:56,413
I'm just saying, you can
if you want. I deserve it.

554
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:59,366
You do deserve it. You
do deserve, Dr. Karev,

555
00:31:59,468 --> 00:32:03,486
to be chastised for your
stunningly poor decision making.

556
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,790
You certainly earned a reprimand

557
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:10,910
for your unbelievably
destructive tactical error.

558
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:16,582
You got in the face
of a drug dealer?

559
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:19,853
You got in the face of a dealer
before the police had arrived?

560
00:32:19,954 --> 00:32:23,089
You got in the face of a felon
while his one-year-old child

561
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,442
was in the room? Are you stupid?
Are you without intelligence?

562
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:27,911
You were taught better.

563
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:31,147
I taught you better
than that, Dr. Karev!

564
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:34,450
Getting in the face
of a drug dealer. Fool!

565
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:41,341
- Thank you.
- Oh, no, thank you.

566
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,321
I am a nice person. OK. I am.

567
00:32:54,423 --> 00:32:58,007
And I don't know what
it is that I did to you,

568
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:00,910
but, you know, we
have the same dad.

569
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:03,346
So I was thinking a
simple conversation...

570
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,948
We don't have the
same dad, Lexie.

571
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:08,918
You and I? We do
not have the same dad.

572
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,055
My dad disappeared
when I was five years old

573
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:15,542
and I never saw him. Sound
like the daddy you grew up with?

574
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:22,716
I kicked a man out of my
bed in the middle of the night,

575
00:33:22,818 --> 00:33:27,754
the world's most perfect man
who loves me. And I can't let him.

576
00:33:27,856 --> 00:33:30,256
And it doesn't take a
shrink to figure out why.

577
00:33:30,358 --> 00:33:33,443
Because our dad chose you.

578
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:36,696
So I'm sure you are
a very nice girl, Lexie.

579
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,932
But I hope you can understand,

580
00:33:39,034 --> 00:33:42,102
you're not a girl I ever
wanted to have to know.

581
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:53,546
I never even tried
drugs until I was 30.

582
00:33:53,648 --> 00:33:56,549
Stupid. So stupid.

583
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:02,271
I went to a party and there was
all this meth floating around and...

584
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,941
I just figured, what the
heck? Once won't kill you.

585
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,527
Then it's more than once.
It's all you think about.

586
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:11,114
Then you're outside your dealer's
house at 7:00 in the morning.

587
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:13,166
This isn't me. It isn't.

588
00:34:13,268 --> 00:34:16,119
I'm not this guy. I'm not
this guy. I'm not this guy.

589
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,490
Clark!

590
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,066
Hello.

591
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,202
It took you long enough.

592
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:35,372
Yes. Well?

593
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:39,091
I came for Preston's key. I'd
like to pick up some of his things

594
00:34:39,194 --> 00:34:42,011
and the necklace I
gave you for the wedding.

595
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,747
Of course.

596
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:48,196
Just, uh, leave it under
the mat when you're done.

597
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:52,923
OK. And I wanted
to say I'm sorry.

598
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:58,261
I... I've come to
know you, I think.

599
00:34:58,363 --> 00:35:01,731
And what you love
even more than Preston

600
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,467
is being a surgeon.

601
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:08,171
You are planning to continue
with cardiothoracic surgery

602
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:11,874
- like my son, am I correct?
- Yes.

603
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:15,811
So I'm sorry you
lost the man you love.

604
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:19,198
But more than that, I'm
sorry you lost your teacher.

605
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,035
With him by your side,

606
00:35:22,137 --> 00:35:25,855
you could've become
a brilliant heart surgeon.

607
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:33,296
- I see.
- You're a strong woman,
Cristina.

608
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:36,499
I respect that.

609
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:40,970
I wish I could have
been born at another time.

610
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:43,306
I might be more like you.

611
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:49,912
So I shall leave the
key under the mat.

612
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:54,117
Uh... Can you take the gifts?

613
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:56,736
There are all these
wedding gifts and I can't...

614
00:35:56,838 --> 00:35:58,888
Can you please take them away?

615
00:36:00,108 --> 00:36:02,208
Of course I can.

616
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:05,845
He's never coming back, is he?

617
00:36:05,947 --> 00:36:07,813
Not even to say goodbye.

618
00:36:09,117 --> 00:36:13,119
Remember, you're a strong woman.

619
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:35,775
His heart couldn't take it.
There was just too much damage.

620
00:36:35,877 --> 00:36:37,927
He couldn't take it.

621
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:45,068
I'm not this guy. I
won't be this guy who...

622
00:36:46,421 --> 00:36:48,021
I'm going to tell her.

623
00:36:51,492 --> 00:36:54,694
- Chief, I...
- I've got paperwork,
Dr. Torres.

624
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:58,431
Kidnapped babies make
for a lot of paperwork.

625
00:36:58,533 --> 00:37:01,412
I was planning on, maybe,
going to see my wife tonight,

626
00:37:01,436 --> 00:37:04,270
- but instead
I get to do this.
- I could help.

627
00:37:04,372 --> 00:37:08,207
- I mean, I could help.
- No. You've helped enough
for one day.

628
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,150
What?

629
00:37:17,252 --> 00:37:19,269
How did I get...?

630
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:23,122
Well, you were cooking crystal
meth and the substances exploded.

631
00:37:27,228 --> 00:37:28,644
Where's... Where's my...?

632
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:32,293
Your husband and your son
sustained only minor injuries.

633
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:36,653
Although it seems your son had been
passively ingesting methamphetamine.

634
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,305
He suffered a
stroke earlier today

635
00:37:39,408 --> 00:37:41,385
and went into
surgery this afternoon.

636
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:45,411
I believe the surgery went smoothly.
Your husband was taken by the police

637
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,425
and I'm sure they'll be
wanting to speak to you as well.

638
00:37:52,921 --> 00:37:57,073
Oh. OK. OK, you know
what? Just try to breathe.

639
00:37:57,175 --> 00:38:00,292
Slowly. Slowly.

640
00:38:00,395 --> 00:38:01,477
Breathe.

641
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,947
I'm sure it must feel

642
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:09,735
as though everything is coming
apart, but you can get through this.

643
00:38:09,837 --> 00:38:12,539
Just breathe.

644
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:18,944
Breathe.

645
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:23,382
<i>The thing about addiction
is, it never ends well.</i>

646
00:38:25,587 --> 00:38:27,186
<i>Because eventually,</i>

647
00:38:27,288 --> 00:38:29,923
<i>whatever it is that
was getting us high...</i>

648
00:38:30,025 --> 00:38:32,992
<i>♪ When you look

649
00:38:33,094 --> 00:38:35,294

650
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,980
<i>and starts to hurt.</i>

651
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:40,433
Want to grab a drink?

652
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:46,338
- I have a problem.
- What's up?

653
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,407
No. I'm just...

654
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,478
I'm admitting I...

655
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,583
I have a problem.

656
00:38:56,685 --> 00:38:59,652
<i>♪ Just add kerosene ♪</i>

657
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:08,110
What's gonna happen
to them? And the baby?

658
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:10,045
Um...

659
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:12,276
His grandmother
is coming for him.

660
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,667
I think she's
gonna take custody.
