00:00:02,352 --> 00:00:03,546
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,298
There's nothing sexual
between you and Georgie?

3
00:00:05,322 --> 00:00:07,956
Don't come to me for
forgiveness, you traitorous bitch.

4
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:10,191
Our marriage is falling
apart. You're never here.

5
00:00:10,293 --> 00:00:13,462
- I have a thing for her.
- Going to end badly.

6
00:00:13,564 --> 00:00:14,746
Cardio is my thing.

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,183
You are flirting with cardio.
I am married to cardio.

8
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,563
What if while I'm waiting,
I meet someone who is

9
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,599
ready to give me
what I want from you?

10
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,234
- Are we friends yet?
- I'm sorry?

11
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:26,136
I don't want you to
date other people.

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,441
I don't want you to
date anybody but me.

13
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:33,131
<i>In the beginning, God created
the heaven and the earth.</i>

14
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,533
<i>At least that's what they say.</i>

15
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:38,737
<i>He created the birds of the
air and the beasts of the field</i>

16
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:41,973
<i>and he looked at his creation
and he saw that it was good.</i>

17
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:46,345
<i>And then God created man
and it's been downhill ever since.</i>

18
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:49,047
- The woman loves me.
- Erica Hahn?

19
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,181
I'm telling you.

20
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,317
We went out last night,
had a couple drinks...

21
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,986
- You and Erica?
- Just me and Hahn.

22
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,487
And Callie.

23
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,284
All right. So, it wasn't a date.

24
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,208
You're gonna tell me
where we're going?

25
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,555
Why does it have to be
about the destination?

26
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,240
Why can't it be
about the journey?

27
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,498
Because I'm wearing
300 dollar shoes.

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,267
Meredith doesn't want
me seeing other people.

29
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:10,702
She found out
about you and Rose?

30
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,788
No. It was just a kiss.

31
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,324
You're not the kind who makes
out with nurses in scrub rooms,

32
00:01:16,426 --> 00:01:18,059
not that there's
anything wrong with it.

33
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,461
- What do you think?
- It was more than just a kiss.

34
00:01:20,564 --> 00:01:24,916
- No, no, no, no. The view.
- Well, what am I looking at?

35
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,402
The view from my new house.

36
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:29,632
Huh?

37
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,578
<i>The story goes on to say that
God created man in his own image,</i>

38
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,520
<i>but there's not
much proof of that.</i>

39
00:01:38,616 --> 00:01:41,383
<i>After all, God made the
sun, the moon, and the stars.</i>

40
00:01:41,485 --> 00:01:43,184
<i>And all man makes is trouble.</i>

41
00:01:43,286 --> 00:01:46,838
It's a classic Victorian
design with an open floor plan.

42
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,408
- What are you doing?
- I'm making an omelet.

43
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,660
What do you think of the house?

44
00:01:51,762 --> 00:01:55,147
The house? I think
the house is great.

45
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:58,600
If you don't like it you can
tell me. It's your house, too.

46
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:01,687
Damn.

47
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,721
So why are you cooking, again?

48
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:06,775
Lexie was having a bad night,

49
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,510
and I thought I would do
something semi-sisterly.

50
00:02:09,613 --> 00:02:12,280
- Really?
- Really.

51
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,526
Wow.

52
00:02:16,453 --> 00:02:18,837
- You getting up?
- No.

53
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:22,741
Maybe. I don't know.

54
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:27,045
- What's that smell?
- Someone's cooking.

55
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,198
That's not cooking.
That's not cooking.

56
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,750
- You're going to be late.
- I hate work.

57
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,002
- Since when?
- Since I hate it.

58
00:02:35,105 --> 00:02:38,707
I hate Cristina. I
hate Hahn. I hate it.

59
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:41,426
What is that smell?

60
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,780
That smells like sulfur.

61
00:02:44,882 --> 00:02:47,882
- Breakfast.
- It's breakfast.

62
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:50,702
No!

63
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:53,238
- Don't go. Don't go.
- What? I have to go.

64
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,541
She made me breakfast.
I'm going. Now stop. Off.

65
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,558
No.

66
00:03:01,565 --> 00:03:02,997
Hey.

67
00:03:03,734 --> 00:03:04,966
Where's your girlfriend?

68
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:07,903
Back with her husband.
I don't have a girlfriend.

69
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:12,007
- Or a conscience, apparently.
- But you knew that going in.

70
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,409
Not saying we have to
build, but we have to plan.

71
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:16,310
Dude, what the hell is that?

72
00:03:16,412 --> 00:03:18,797
Meredith cooked, to do
something nice for Lexie.

73
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:21,182
- You cooked for me?
- It's no big deal.

74
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,517
Just eggs and avocado

75
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,687
and whatever cheese
that was in the fridge.

76
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,323
I love avocados.

77
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,409
Is it OK?

78
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,519
OK.

79
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:45,690
OK. This little man has
been fed and changed.

80
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,886
There we go.

81
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,545
I put the building manager's
number on my desk.

82
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:54,733
Do not believe him when he
tells you that he can fix the sink.

83
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,780
Remind him he's
the one that broke it

84
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:59,124
when he tried to fix the pipes.

85
00:04:03,961 --> 00:04:06,494
- OK.
- Miranda.

86
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:07,896
You're talking to me now?

87
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,909
Now that I'm on my
way out the door?

88
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:11,482
You're always on your way out.

89
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,036
Are you interested in
being part of this family?

90
00:04:14,138 --> 00:04:16,905
I can't do this now.
I don't have time.

91
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:24,279
- Dr. Torres.
- Dr. Hahn,

92
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:26,348
anyone who can outdrink
me and still kick my ass

93
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:28,249
at the dartboard gets
to call me "Callie."

94
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,252
Last night was
actually fun, wasn't it?

95
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,420
Mmm-hmm.

96
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,973
- And I'm not a group person.
- Me, neither.

97
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:38,226
I think it's because I
generally don't like people.

98
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:40,161
Me, neither.

99
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:44,665
Morning, ladies.

100
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:46,918
Case in point.

101
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,292
What's so funny?

102
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:55,260
<i>When man finds
himself in trouble,</i>

103
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:56,661
<i>which is most of the time,</i>

104
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,930
<i>he turns to something
bigger than himself,</i>

105
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,683
<i>to love or fate or religion
to make sense of it all.</i>

106
00:05:01,785 --> 00:05:03,184
SweeTart?

107
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:06,304
Do you ever eat anything that
remotely resembles real food?

108
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,802
You'll have to take
me to dinner to find out.

109
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:10,091
I can't do that.

110
00:05:10,193 --> 00:05:15,813
That kiss was unexpected.
I like kissing you.

111
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,884
I enjoyed kissing you,
but I'm seeing somebody.

112
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,251
Meredith Grey.

113
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:23,104
Everybody knows about
you and Meredith Grey.

114
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:25,757
I have to see it
through. I'm sorry.

115
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,226
Don't be. It was just a kiss.

116
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,329
See you in surgery,
Dr. Shepherd.

117
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:31,796
<i>But for a surgeon,</i>

118
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:36,985
<i>the only thing that makes
any kind of sense is medicine.</i>

119
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:38,853
Yes.

120
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,907
Back off. Elizabeth
Archer is my patient.

121
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,894
Technically, she's Hahn's
patient, but whatever.

122
00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:49,548
I'm scrubbing in on a major
coronary artery dissection with Hahn,

123
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,449
and you're not going
to fight me for it?

124
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,502
I'm not doing the cardio
thing anymore. I am over it.

125
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,638
You're over it?

126
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,322
Whoa, whoa.

127
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:01,426
- Why? What do you have?
- Nothing. I'm charting.

128
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,161
Stevens. Elizabeth
Archer's chart?

129
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,530
Yang has it. You two have fun.

130
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:09,917
She's not a cardiothoracic
surgeon. I am the rock star.

131
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,655
- Karev, are you a rock star?
- Always.

132
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:16,073
You're with me today.

133
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:19,044
Congratulations. Your life
just got more interesting.

134
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,631
Karev doesn't know anything
about Elizabeth Archer.

135
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,533
You can read,
can't you, Dr. Karev?

136
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:29,704
Yes. "Elizabeth Archer, 49, came
into the ER yesterday complaining of..."

137
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,051
An urgent cardiac cath
demonstrated dissection

138
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:34,020
of the proximal
two-thirds of the LAD.

139
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:35,638
She was admitted
for observation.

140
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,562
While I admire your preparation,

141
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:41,032
there is one thing about the
patient you've failed to notice.

142
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,970
She's gone.

143
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,724
- <i>Dr. O'Dell to the...</i>
- Callie!

144
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,126
Mrs. O'Malley. Hi.

145
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,213
- Hi.
- How've you been?

146
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,596
Well, I've been
worried, is how I've been.

147
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,479
I've called, I've left messages.

148
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,953
I know how busy you two are,
but you can't pick up the phone

149
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:05,439
once in a while? Never
mind water under the bridge.

150
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,970
I was in the neighborhood,
and I hope you don't mind,

151
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,472
but I just couldn't
wait to show you

152
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:11,674
some of the outfits
I've been making.

153
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,309
- Outfits?
- Don't get mad,

154
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,250
but Georgie told me
you were trying, so...

155
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:18,737
what do you think?

156
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:23,057
- It's yellow.
- I see that.

157
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,260
Dr. Bailey?

158
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,545
Whatever it is, I
don't have time.

159
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,698
I think I need some epinephrine.

160
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:35,119
- Tucker, now's not a good time.
- Epinephrine?

161
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,805
The cart's around the corner.
Can you give her the...?

162
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:40,809
- Thank you.
- No, I told you,
I put it on my desk.

163
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:44,512
- Code blue.
- I have to call you back.

164
00:07:47,284 --> 00:07:50,868
You're going to have to step
back from the patient, ma'am.

165
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:53,988
- Ma'am?
- Just one second.

166
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,207
Ms. Archer? What
is she doing here?

167
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,725
I have no idea. Who is she?

168
00:07:57,827 --> 00:08:00,840
It's Hahn's patient. Ms. Archer,
you need to get back to your bed.

169
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,900
There.

170
00:08:08,305 --> 00:08:11,389
What'd did you do to him?
He was V-tach and now...

171
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,442
I healed him. I'm a healer.

172
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,228
Oh!

173
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,538
You're a faith healer?

174
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,306
I am a healer and I have faith.

175
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,941
But I'm not sure
the two are related.

176
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,376
Ms. Archer, you collapsed.

177
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,944
You could go into cardiac
arrest at any moment.

178
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,287
I'm less interested in
what you do for a living

179
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,517
than I am with
getting you into...

180
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:40,802
I want to know what
she did to Mr. Greenwald.

181
00:08:40,904 --> 00:08:43,822
He's been in and out of V-tach
all day and now he's stable.

182
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,958
Maybe because of the
amiodarone he got two hours ago.

183
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,144
Really? Does amiodarone
usually take two hours to kick in?

184
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:54,082
Ms. Archer, you have a
coronary artery dissection.

185
00:08:54,184 --> 00:08:57,018
Dr. Karev and I need
to get you into surgery

186
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,603
as soon as possible.

187
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,172
I appreciate that, but I
am not going into surgery

188
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,758
until we've exhausted
all other possibilities.

189
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,045
Ms. Archer, if you don't
have the surgery soon,

190
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,275
I can guarantee you
that the blood supply

191
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,777
to your heart will be cut off.

192
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,133
I'll have to open you up anyway.

193
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:14,986
All I'm asking for is that
you give me some time

194
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,655
and talk me through the
surgery you'd like to perform,

195
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:21,126
so that I may visualize
it while I do what I do.

196
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,495
And if it doesn't work, then
you can slice me open, OK?

197
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:29,167
Dr. Karev can work with you

198
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,263
doing whatever
it is that you do.

199
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:33,188
I'll check in soon.

200
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,473
Call me when she codes.

201
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,294
<i>Pharmacy two-nine-four.</i>

202
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:43,564
- What are you looking for?
- I need epinephrine.

203
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,134
Why?

204
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:48,063
- What happened to you?
- I'm an adult child

205
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,366
of an alcoholic. I
have boundary issues.

206
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,924
When Meredith made me
eggs, I couldn't not eat them.

207
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,090
I had to pretend I
wasn't allergic to eggs,

208
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,290
now I have a rash
covering my body.

209
00:09:57,314 --> 00:09:59,397
- Give me your arm.
- I'm codependent,

210
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:00,779
my throat is closing up.

211
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,853
Ow... And now my
arm hurts. Thanks.

212
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:07,105
You're welcome.

213
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,257
Thank you for letting
me crash on your couch.

214
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,426
You didn't tell your
mom that we broke up?

215
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,996
Your mom thinks we're
still trying to get pregnant.

216
00:10:15,098 --> 00:10:17,432
She thinks you're
the kind of person

217
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:18,933
who would never
cheat on his wife.

218
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,051
Hand-stitched,
unisex baby clothes!

219
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:24,839
They're yellow and green
and go up to toddler sizes.

220
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:27,792
And she's waiting
for you in the lobby.

221
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,782
- Hey.
- Hey.

222
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,098
You never told me what
you thought of the house.

223
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,367
- I have a house.
- That's your house.

224
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:36,667
I'm talking our house.

225
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,337
Between yesterday and
today you had plans drawn up?

226
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,206
No, I've had the
plans for months.

227
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:42,974
But I decided to
share them with you.

228
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,356
Why?

229
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,212
Nothing's really
changed, has it?

230
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,431
Everything's the same as it was.

231
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:51,794
No, it's just...
it's really a lot.

232
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,084
And it's fast.

233
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,620
- I'm trying to
take a step forward.
- OK.

234
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:58,673
There are about 100 steps
between where we are right now

235
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:00,074
and building our dream house.

236
00:11:00,176 --> 00:11:02,693
And they'll be fun
steps and sexy steps.

237
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:06,414
And we'll try not to fall
down them together. OK?

238
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,917
OK.

239
00:11:11,388 --> 00:11:12,828
- OK.
- Dr. Bailey!

240
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,482
- Chief?
- Yeah.

241
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:17,725
Rumor has it Dr. Hahn has a
patient who's wandering the halls.

242
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:19,660
She's back in her bed, sir.

243
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,629
And laying hands
on other patients.

244
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:24,365
- It was just one patient.
- And healing them.

245
00:11:24,468 --> 00:11:26,801
For which there's a
reasonable medical explanation.

246
00:11:28,305 --> 00:11:30,738
Of course. But I can't have
a hospital full of sick people

247
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,608
thinking there's a miracle
woman on the cardiac ward.

248
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,493
It creates panic and hysteria,

249
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,044
and frankly, it's
bad for business.

250
00:11:37,147 --> 00:11:39,347
- Are you gonna answer that?
- No, I'm not.

251
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,882
Make sure this woman
keeps her hands to herself?

252
00:11:41,985 --> 00:11:44,369
- Yes.
- Thank you, Dr. Bailey.

253
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:51,593
Dr. Sloan,

254
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:54,979
why are you endangering
the life of my patient?

255
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,726
Because your
patient had her hands

256
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,532
all over one of my patients.

257
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,117
I was trying to heal her.

258
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,254
Don't worry your pretty little
head about it, Sloan. Karev?

259
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,122
Even when you're insulting me,

260
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,002
you manage to tell
me how pretty I am?

261
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,709
It wasn't meant as a compliment.

262
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,228
Is this a gender reversal thing,

263
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,580
where you're the
big man on campus,

264
00:12:12,682 --> 00:12:15,633
and I'm the blonde whose
ponytail you can't stop pulling?

265
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,219
Why don't you get
that I just don't like you?

266
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:23,007
That I think you are a crass,
predatory, ape of a man,

267
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,776
who happens to be
a decent surgeon?

268
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,894
You want to heal
someone? Heal her.

269
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,746
This is toxic in here.

270
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,443
Could somebody
take me to my room?

271
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:32,645
My healing team
should be arriving soon.

272
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,035
I'll take you.

273
00:12:34,137 --> 00:12:35,286
Mrs. O'Malley?

274
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,538
- There she is! Come here.
- Hi!

275
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,291
What are you doing here?
Does George know you're here?

276
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:44,645
Callie said she'd find him for
me. How are you, dear? You OK?

277
00:12:44,747 --> 00:12:48,816
- You talked to Callie?
- Poor thing. It's hard for her.

278
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:51,397
You try and you try,
but we're all human.

279
00:12:51,421 --> 00:12:52,820
Nobody's perfect.

280
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:55,256
And in the end
it's nobody's fault.

281
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,741
I'm so happy to
hear you say that.

282
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:59,427
I have just felt so
terrible about it.

283
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,928
I know. Me, too.

284
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:04,399
You know, we just... We
didn't mean for it to happen.

285
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:06,751
I know how that
sounds, but it's true.

286
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:08,335
We were drunk.

287
00:13:08,438 --> 00:13:11,755
It only happened one time and
I know that doesn't make it right,

288
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:15,560
but it was never my intention
to break up George's marriage.

289
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:18,963
I didn't know I was in love with
him. George was so distraught.

290
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:21,732
I think that's why he
failed the intern test, so...

291
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:24,468
- He failed?
- He didn't tell you that part?

292
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,257
- He didn't tell me any part.
- You said you talked to Callie.

293
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:33,038
About baby clothes. I thought she
was having trouble getting pregnant.

294
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,429
I made baby clothes.

295
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,166
- Oh, no.
- Mom.

296
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:43,271
- What?
- I'm sorry.

297
00:13:43,373 --> 00:13:46,607
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

298
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,762
Hey. I know I said I'd
call you right back...

299
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,442
Tucker, wait. I
can't do this now.

300
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,166
I'm being paged to the ER.

301
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:57,634
What do you mean
you're the one paging me?

302
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:00,821
I told you never to page
me at the hospital unless...

303
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,684
There was an accident.

304
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,425
All four limbs are moving.

305
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,011
Pupils are responsive
and dilating.

306
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,479
There's no neurological damage.

307
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:26,698
Get him on a monitor.

308
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,761
Where's the X-ray
for the trauma series?

309
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,302
Order a left forearm.
There's bruising and swelling.

310
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,482
Mama's right
here. I'm right here.

311
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,039
He was under a bookshelf?

312
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,074
The whole thing must
have fallen over on him,

313
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,493
And all those medical books.

314
00:14:38,595 --> 00:14:41,979
He tried to climb up and pulled
it over. I heard him screaming.

315
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,176
I'm trying to
hear. Stop talking.

316
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,481
- Miranda, let me do that.
- No, no. I got it. I got it.

317
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,252
- Miranda.
- What?

318
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:52,957
This is why we put the
baby gate in the living room.

319
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,326
- The gate was open.
- You left the gate open?

320
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,578
- No, I didn't.
- I left the gate open?

321
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,946
Accidents happen.

322
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:01,915
Not if you take the time to
bolt the bookshelves to the wall.

323
00:15:02,018 --> 00:15:04,635
I can't baby-proof and
watch him at the same time.

324
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,555
Weren't watching him,
otherwise we wouldn't be here.

325
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,840
Got decreased breath
sounds on the left

326
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:12,165
- and his abdomen's rigid.
- What does all this mean?

327
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,079
- There may be
internal injuries.
- What kind?

328
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,731
We don't have time. He
needs a full trauma work up.

329
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,134
Clear a CT and get me
an ultrasound machine.

330
00:15:21,805 --> 00:15:25,139
This is not OK,
Georgie. This is not OK.

331
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:28,826
You're planning to marry Izzie?
You're planning an annulment?

332
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,797
- This is not about Izzie.
- What is it about? It isn't OK!

333
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,498
I raised you better than this.

334
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,134
I never should have gotten
married in the first place.

335
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,571
But you did. You got
married. You didn't invite me.

336
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,368
You didn't let me
plan a wedding.

337
00:15:42,392 --> 00:15:46,193
I accepted it because you
were happy. I won't accept this.

338
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:48,228
- Mom.
- We're Catholic.

339
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,813
We don't believe in divorce.

340
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,433
And we certainly don't
believe in adultery.

341
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,130
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry to me.

342
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,470
Be sorry to Father
Mike. You call him.

343
00:15:56,572 --> 00:15:58,339
He'll hear your confession

344
00:15:58,441 --> 00:16:00,302
and he'll get you and
Callie into counseling.

345
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:03,794
- It's too late for that.
- No, it's not too late.

346
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:08,465
You made a vow to
Callie and a vow to God.

347
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:12,053
You don't walk away from that.
This is your soul we're talking about.

348
00:16:12,155 --> 00:16:14,272
- I have to go.
- No, you will not.

349
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,089
You will not walk away from me!

350
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:19,059
It's Dr. Bailey. I have to go.

351
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,435
- What happened?
- He got crushed under
a bookshelf.

352
00:16:28,537 --> 00:16:30,971
- Rib fractures.
- Might have dropped a lung.

353
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:34,041
They're worried there may
be damage to the heart.

354
00:16:34,143 --> 00:16:37,661
Get him to radiology for a
head, chest and abdominal CT.

355
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,858
O'Malley, tell the
lab to move fast.

356
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:43,400
Karev, clear out.
We'll keep you posted.

357
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,753
Dr. Bailey's worked up,
and I want to make sure

358
00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:47,888
that doesn't get in the
way of the baby's care.

359
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:52,276
- I don't need a babysitter.
- I know you don't. Stay with her.

360
00:16:58,902 --> 00:17:01,486
Sorry about that. There
was an emergency.

361
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,587
Dr. Karev, this is Dawn and Mai.

362
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,085
- Nice to meet you.
- He's a skeptic. Shouldn't be here.

363
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,160
- Is Dr. Hahn coming?
- Dr. Hahn's
been called into surgery.

364
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,828
She asked me to talk
you through the procedure.

365
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,030
Is she going to be long?

366
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,144
I'm hoping she's done
before your heart blows,

367
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:17,101
but I can't make promises.

368
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,719
I told you he shouldn't be here.

369
00:17:18,821 --> 00:17:23,140
I need someone who knows what they're
doing to talk me through the surgery.

370
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,376
This? It's crap. You're
stalling. You're scared.

371
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:29,347
Of course, I'm
scared. Surgery is...

372
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:32,799
It's barbaric. You tear
flesh and spill blood.

373
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:37,621
I work with light. I work with
energy. I visualize healing.

374
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,073
If there's the slightest
chance what I do works,

375
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:41,509
isn't that preferable?

376
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:43,121
I don't believe in what you do.

377
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:47,298
I'm not asking you to. I'm
asking you to help me to do it.

378
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,569
Can you imagine how
horrible this is for her?

379
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,031
This is why people
should not have kids.

380
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:56,524
What's the matter with
you? It's Bailey's baby.

381
00:17:56,626 --> 00:17:58,058
See, no, it's a trauma case.

382
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,061
If we are going to be
effective in saving that kid's life,

383
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:05,583
it can't be Bailey's baby.
He's a blunt trauma case.

384
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:08,469
You and Hahn are exactly
alike. You deserve each other.

385
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:10,755
- Thank you.
- I thought you loved cardio.

386
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:13,591
No, no. She's pretending
not to anymore.

387
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:16,961
- Can't take the pressure, Iz?
- You're right, Cristina.

388
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,881
In the contest to see who
can be the best robot, you win.

389
00:18:19,983 --> 00:18:22,099
Ooh... Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

390
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,411
Tell me again how this happened?

391
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,913
- You didn't understand me?
- Just tell me again.

392
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,592
Somebody left
the baby gate open.

393
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,715
Somebody.

394
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:41,035
Did you...?

395
00:18:41,137 --> 00:18:43,054
You're saying
you think I did this?

396
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:46,907
I'm saying that you were in such a
hurry to get out the house this morning,

397
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:51,696
that you were in such a hurry to
get to work and get away from me...

398
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,798
Doesn't have
anything to do with you.

399
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,000
Why do you think he
even went into that room?

400
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,214
You're the only one
who goes in there.

401
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:01,071
He went looking for his mama.

402
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:05,159
He went looking for his mama
and wound up in the hospital!

403
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,034
You made a bad
choice, huh, Tucker?

404
00:19:13,135 --> 00:19:15,803
You picked a bad wife,

405
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:21,175
she made a bad mother, she
made you stay home, raise your son,

406
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:25,363
and she almost killed
him. Poor you, huh?

407
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:30,634
<i>Dr. Mahoney to the ER.
Dr. Mahoney to the ER.</i>

408
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,956
I heard about Dr. Bailey's
son. How bad is it?

409
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:38,103
We're still waiting
on his studies.

410
00:19:38,127 --> 00:19:40,962
Derek?

411
00:19:41,064 --> 00:19:42,580
Remember before when I was cool

412
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,562
and let you off the hook
for making out with me?

413
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,400
- Well, now I'm angry.
- Why?

414
00:19:46,502 --> 00:19:48,686
You're not making
eye contact with me.

415
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,704
Because we are talking
about Bailey's baby

416
00:19:50,806 --> 00:19:53,090
and you won't look at me.

417
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:56,393
- Sorry.
- Better.

418
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,096
Now, it was one kiss, OK?

419
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,399
It was a good kiss,
maybe even a great one,

420
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,835
but are we going to let one
maybe great kiss get in the way

421
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,287
of what has been a great
professional relationship,

422
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:09,356
even if you didn't know
my name until recently?

423
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,625
No, we are not.

424
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:14,745
So, friends?

425
00:20:15,531 --> 00:20:17,931
- Friends.
- Good.

426
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:24,388
Bailey wants to know if
Tuck's films are ready.

427
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,156
What? Is that...?

428
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:28,103
What's that shadow?
Where's his heart?

429
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,878
- You can't see it because...
- His stomach's in his chest.

430
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,420
Visceral herniation.
A positive collar sign.

431
00:20:33,516 --> 00:20:35,678
Which indicates a
diaphragmatic hernia.

432
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:38,002
It's a ruptured diaphragm.

433
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:40,804
Which is the least
of his problems

434
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:44,742
because the force of the
trauma injured his thoracic aorta.

435
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,177
And you see this?

436
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:49,346
In the chest cavity next to
the stomach? That's colon.

437
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,181
And around the colon is fluid.

438
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,984
Which could mean
the colon has ruptured

439
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,953
and there's fecal
matter floating around

440
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:58,289
that could infect
the aortic repair.

441
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:02,025
And that complication
can be fatal.

442
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:08,181
What are you all standing around
for? Page Hahn and the Chief!

443
00:21:08,283 --> 00:21:09,850
Book an OR!

444
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:18,676
They repaired the
hole in the diaphragm.

445
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,078
Dr. Hahn's about to
inspect the mediastinum.

446
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,680
Is she gonna repair with
sutures or prosthetic graft?

447
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,615
- Don't know.
- You don't know?

448
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,634
She didn't say.

449
00:21:29,405 --> 00:21:32,406
- Dr. Bailey!
- Dr. Bailey? Are you kidding?

450
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:35,342
- I need to be with my son.
- Miranda.

451
00:21:35,444 --> 00:21:37,328
I have no intention
of getting in the way.

452
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,979
I can't stand out there.

453
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:41,198
I can't. I need to
be with my son.

454
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,999
And what we need, Dr. Bailey,

455
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:45,636
is to not have our
patient's mother

456
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:47,649
watching us perform his surgery.

457
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:50,574
Dr. Grey, please escort
Dr. Bailey back outside.

458
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:54,795
There will be no escorting of
Dr. Bailey anywhere, Dr. Grey.

459
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,213
Now you can proceed.

460
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,133
I will not proceed
until you leave this OR.

461
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,768
Now, do you want me to
stand here talking to you

462
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,922
or do you want me to try
and save your baby's life?

463
00:22:09,678 --> 00:22:11,145
Miranda.

464
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,613
I just want to hold
my son's hand.

465
00:22:12,715 --> 00:22:15,115
I just want to hold
his hand, please.

466
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:16,701
I'll hold his hand.

467
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,354
Dr. Grey can hold
this retractor, right?

468
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:21,822
Yes.

469
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:25,025
I'll hold Tuck's hand,
Dr. Bailey, if it's OK with you.

470
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:27,627
I'll hold his hand.

471
00:22:36,372 --> 00:22:37,972
OK, go, go, go.

472
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:43,177
OK, everybody,
let's get back to work.

473
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,176
Mrs. O'Malley, what are you...?

474
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:00,844
I couldn't leave.

475
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:03,313
When Harold was
here, when he was sick,

476
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:06,133
Dr. Bailey took such
good care of him.

477
00:23:06,235 --> 00:23:10,054
I couldn't leave knowing
her son was in trouble.

478
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:13,374
Knowing both our
sons are in trouble.

479
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:14,608
Mrs. O'Malley, I...

480
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:19,179
Look, I know you
think I'm old-fashioned

481
00:23:19,281 --> 00:23:20,409
and maybe I am.

482
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:23,717
But it doesn't
matter what I think.

483
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:26,156
In God's eyes,
marriage is forever.

484
00:23:26,254 --> 00:23:30,390
If it's any consolation, George
and I got married on the Vegas strip

485
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:34,895
at a 24 Hour Church of Elvis.
I'm not sure God was even there.

486
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,596
He's everywhere.

487
00:23:39,802 --> 00:23:42,285
I used to believe in God.

488
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:47,792
And marriage. And
Heaven and Hell.

489
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:50,094
But you don't anymore?

490
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,101
I believe in love.

491
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,988
And second chances.

492
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:05,226
And that even though
George wasn't the one for me,

493
00:24:05,328 --> 00:24:09,413
it was OK that I believed
that he was, because...

494
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:13,884
Well, for a little while at
least, I got to be an O'Malley.

495
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:22,342
And I really loved
being an O'Malley.

496
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:30,583
He's back.

497
00:24:30,685 --> 00:24:34,054
I'm sorry to interrupt, but
your most recent echo shows

498
00:24:34,156 --> 00:24:35,956
the dissection is extending.

499
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,091
You need to let me
prep you for surgery.

500
00:24:38,193 --> 00:24:41,095
Oh, no. No, not yet. We
haven't finished our work.

501
00:24:41,197 --> 00:24:42,980
You're going to die.

502
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:45,081
Do you know how Mai
knew you were back

503
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,600
even with her eyes closed?

504
00:24:46,702 --> 00:24:48,802
- She heard me?
- She felt you.

505
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,889
It's like a pull,
like a darkness.

506
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,241
Right, I'm the
angel of death, got it.

507
00:24:54,343 --> 00:24:58,328
No. You're not the
angel of death, Dr. Karev.

508
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,314
You're actually
a very sweet boy.

509
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,949
He's got a beautiful heart,
wouldn't you say, Mai?

510
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:06,269
- I would. But his gut
and his throat...
- They're blocked.

511
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:07,620
Second chakra's worse.

512
00:25:07,722 --> 00:25:10,290
You're talking about "chakras?"

513
00:25:10,392 --> 00:25:14,294
You've got a darkness at your throat
chakra where your voice should be.

514
00:25:14,396 --> 00:25:18,314
Because whatever
happened to you was so ugly

515
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:19,950
and went on for so long

516
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:21,685
that you don't talk about it.

517
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:24,137
You were hurt so
badly that sometimes

518
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:29,310
you want to hurt other
people just to spread it around.

519
00:25:29,412 --> 00:25:35,449
You were a good boy,
Dr. Karev. A good, sweet boy.

520
00:25:35,551 --> 00:25:39,319
But you're not a very good
man. What happened to you?

521
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,142
Your artery is shredding.
You need surgery.

522
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:47,622
I'm not a very good
man, but I do tell the truth.

523
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:50,014
And the truth is, if you
don't get this surgery fast,

524
00:25:50,116 --> 00:25:51,981
you're going to die.

525
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:54,818
I left it on the desk.

526
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,388
I walked to the office
door and I closed the gate.

527
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,040
I walked out of the
bedroom and wrote a note

528
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,875
to the building manager.

529
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,989
I left it on the desk.
I was in a hurry.

530
00:26:04,013 --> 00:26:08,315
But I looked at the clock.
I walked out of the door.

531
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:11,218
- The gate was opened.
- Miranda, this isn't helping.

532
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,237
- Did I close the gate?
- Stop this. It's not helping.

533
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:17,141
I walked out of the bedroom,
into the office, wrote a note.

534
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:20,361
- This isn't helping. Stop this.
- I can't remember!

535
00:26:20,463 --> 00:26:22,590
I can't remember
if I closed that gate.

536
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:25,832
- I can't remember
if I closed the gate.
- It doesn't matter.

537
00:26:25,934 --> 00:26:28,802
It does matter
because I'm his mother

538
00:26:28,904 --> 00:26:30,737
and I can't have
done this to him.

539
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,805
You didn't do this.
Things just happen.

540
00:26:32,908 --> 00:26:35,909
No! They don't just happen!
Things don't just happen.

541
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,913
People make decisions!
People prioritize!

542
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:44,034
The world doesn't just happen,
OK? It's not on God, it's on me!

543
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:45,969
- Or it's on Tucker!
- Stop.

544
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:49,239
- It's on me or Tucker!
- Stop it, stop it.

545
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:53,843
Just stop it.

546
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,296
- Oh, no.
- You're a good mother.

547
00:26:56,398 --> 00:26:58,798
Tucker is a good father.

548
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:03,604
You love your baby.
People make mistakes.

549
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:08,642
You didn't do this to your son
and neither did your husband.

550
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,917
He wants to build us a house.

551
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:20,720
With kids' bedrooms
and French doors

552
00:27:20,822 --> 00:27:22,339
and that scares me to death.

553
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:23,441
Why?

554
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,375
Just because of the Rose thing?

555
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,946
Well, that shouldn't scare
you. It was just one kiss.

556
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:30,347
One kiss?

557
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:33,117
It wasn't like they were
being secretive about it.

558
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,418
It was just something
that happened.

559
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:38,889
You guys are back together,
it's not happening anymore, so...

560
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:42,475
- Derek kissed Rose?
- Yeah, but you knew that.

561
00:27:45,013 --> 00:27:49,750
That I'm an idiot.

562
00:27:54,056 --> 00:27:57,458
OK, the stomach's repaired.
There's no splenic laceration.

563
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,261
Now all I have to do is get the
chest tube in and we're done.

564
00:28:02,698 --> 00:28:03,863
That's good.

565
00:28:03,966 --> 00:28:05,710
You're in better
shape than we thought.

566
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,695
It means you're
almost out of here.

567
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:12,555
Dr. Yang, would you
like to do the honors?

568
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:14,874
I can trade places
with you, if you'd like.

569
00:28:17,045 --> 00:28:19,696
No, I'm OK. I'm OK here.

570
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,606
His stomach
ruptured, not his colon.

571
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:33,560
Both of which we repaired,
so the surgery was a success.

572
00:28:33,662 --> 00:28:37,081
However, there is a lot
of fluid in the chest cavity.

573
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:39,349
So, at this point, we
have no way of knowing

574
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,602
whether he'll be able
to breathe on his own.

575
00:28:41,704 --> 00:28:44,721
I know that. You
don't think I know that?

576
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:48,007
We'll be moving him
to the pediatric ICU.

577
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:51,077
- We'll be watching him closely.
- Can I see my son now?

578
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:53,063
Absolutely.

579
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,834
You're new here.
You don't know me.

580
00:29:02,858 --> 00:29:06,676
If what you did today ends up saving
my son's life, I'll thank you for it.

581
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:10,764
But if I never have to
look at you again after that,

582
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:12,583
that'll be all right with me.

We kept putting it off, thinking
we were going to find time.

586
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,602
And now...

587
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:36,155
We will find the time.

588
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:41,010

00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,648
you and I are

590

He's still not

You know, I wish I could help,

but I can't think of
anything I can do.

00:30:27,543 --> 00:30:29,943
Cristina always
knows what to do.

601
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:33,380
What's your deal
with her? With Yang?

602
00:30:33,482 --> 00:30:36,733
Nothing. There's no deal.
I'm crippled with envy.

603
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,620
Of Yang? Because
she's better at cardio?

604
00:30:40,722 --> 00:30:43,006
She's not better than me.

605
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:44,958
She just...

606
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,595
She knows what she wants.

607
00:30:48,697 --> 00:30:53,783
She has this faith in her skill and
herself and her future in cardio.

608
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:56,519
It's an unwavering faith.

609
00:30:57,489 --> 00:31:00,123
She knows who
she is and I want that.

610
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:03,876
I was chasing cardio
because I want what she has.

611
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:06,947
- She's a robot.
- Not the robot part.

612
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:08,281
The faith part.

613
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,668

There's probably a

why Mr. Greenwald's heart
rate suddenly stabilized.

619
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:41,564
Without question.

620
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:47,437
And why Miss McCaffrey's staph
infection suddenly disappeared.

621
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,973
Sloan's patient? She's fine?

622
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:54,494
I mean, don't get me
wrong. I have faith.

623
00:31:54,596 --> 00:31:57,814
Now, I do.

624
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:01,301
But faith isn't medicine.

625
00:32:01,403 --> 00:32:04,904
Faith can't heal you.

626
00:32:06,942 --> 00:32:08,942
Well, that may be so.

627
00:32:09,878 --> 00:32:14,180
But then again, it can't hurt.

628
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:21,882
- Hey.
- Hey.

629
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:23,186
How's Tuck?

630
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:26,476
He's intubated and we won't
know anything for a few hours.

631
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:31,080
- How are you holding up?
- Who's Rose?

632
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:36,853
Rose is a circulating
nurse. I kissed her once.

633
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:39,439
I'm sure you know that.
It's why you're asking me.

634
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,274
- When?
- When?

635
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,027
- When did you kiss her?
- Yesterday.

636
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:48,198
You were making out with nurses, and
today you're building our dream house?

637
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,583
- We were dating other people.
- Not the point.

638
00:32:50,685 --> 00:32:55,272
That is the point. I told
you I wanted to marry you.

639
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:58,291
I wanted to build a life with
you and you weren't ready.

640
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,678
And Rose is? You don't
want to build a life with me.

641
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,999
You want someone. You want someone
who wants the same things that you want.

642
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,070
I knew the minute I
showed you those plans

643
00:33:10,171 --> 00:33:13,172
- you'd find reason
to walk away.
- You called my bluff?

644
00:33:13,274 --> 00:33:15,308
I did, because I
can't do this anymore.

645
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,627
I can't do the back
and forth. I can't.

646
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:18,962
Are we together or are we not?

647
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:21,080
We were together. I
was in love with you.

648
00:33:21,182 --> 00:33:23,683
You didn't tell me
you were married.

649
00:33:23,785 --> 00:33:24,962
We're gonna have that fight?

650
00:33:24,986 --> 00:33:26,503
You didn't tell me
about your nurse.

651
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:29,589
You want to know why I'm not
ready to build a house with you?

652
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:33,292
- Because I cannot trust you.
- You can't trust anybody.

653
00:33:35,964 --> 00:33:37,697
And no matter what I do...

654
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:42,669
you're always gonna look
for reasons not to trust me.

655
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,238
I can't do it anymore.

656
00:33:48,043 --> 00:33:50,510
- I can't.
- Well, neither can I.

- Is he better?
- We don't know yet.

688
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:12,953
I know I haven't
called you in a while.

689
00:36:13,055 --> 00:36:17,591
And that there's a lot that I
haven't told you. I know I messed up.

690
00:36:17,693 --> 00:36:22,128
But I didn't want to cause you any
more pain, I didn't want to disappoint you.

You disappointed yourself. You
should be disappointed in yourself.

692
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:29,569
I am.

693
00:36:30,705 --> 00:36:34,975
I don't even recognize
myself anymore.

694
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:37,978
This isn't the guy
that I wanted to be.

695
00:36:38,913 --> 00:36:41,047
Who do you want to be?

696
00:36:42,851 --> 00:36:45,985
The guy Bailey
named her baby after.

697
00:36:47,021 --> 00:36:50,022
I want to be that guy again.

698
00:36:51,093 --> 00:36:53,392
You won't go to counseling?

699
00:36:56,564 --> 00:36:59,599
That's just going to
hurt everyone more.

700
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:07,107
- I miss your dad.
- Me, too.

701
00:37:07,209 --> 00:37:10,493
Move back home.
I'll take care of you.

702
00:37:12,698 --> 00:37:16,682

started taking care of myself.

It doesn't help me. I appreciate

00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,924
But I don't need to be watched.

- He's choking?

OK! Oh, thank God!

00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:37,063
So you think there might
be something to this?

723
00:38:37,165 --> 00:38:40,867
No. But I'm going to help
you anyway, or she is.

724
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:43,402
- This is Dr. Stevens.
- Hello.

725
00:38:43,504 --> 00:38:45,105
Hi.

726
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,870
I'm sorry. I'm not sure
what I'm doing here.

727
00:38:48,894 --> 00:38:52,062
You're gonna talk her through a
coronary artery dissection repair.

728
00:38:52,147 --> 00:38:54,814
- She's an expert?
- No, no, no.

729
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,482
She's a second year resident.

730
00:38:56,584 --> 00:39:00,419
She's been focused on cardiothoracics
and she's seen the procedure done.

731
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:03,522
Well, I appreciate what
you're trying to do, but...

732
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:05,842
She's like a bright
yellow, right?

733
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:07,944
- What?
- What?

734
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:10,930
She's an optimist.
She's the opposite of me.

735
00:39:11,032 --> 00:39:13,917
She's exactly the kind of person
you want helping you, right?

736
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:17,153
- She brightens you,
that's for sure.
- Shut up.

737
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:19,255
What are we talking about?

738
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:23,826
Just talk her through the surgery before
she croaks, all right? Can you do that?

739
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:26,057
You want me to
talk you through it?

740
00:39:26,081 --> 00:39:28,831
Uh... In as much
detail as possible, yes.

741
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,716
OK.

742
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:33,836
Yang's got nothing on you.

743
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:40,059
OK. There are four
chambers in your heart,

744
00:39:40,161 --> 00:39:44,196
and three major coronary arteries
that supply blood and oxygen.

745
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:47,850
<i>As doctors, we know more
about the human body now</i>

746
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:50,252
<i>than at any other
point in our history.</i>

747
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:53,456
They extubated him. His
blood pressure's up, too.

748
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,625
Good.

749
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,927
Do you know that his
middle name is George?

750
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:00,162
- Tuck's?
- After me.

751
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,667
I thought Dr. Bailey
didn't like interns.

752
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:08,170
Yeah, she doesn't.

753
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:11,324
Did you find an apartment yet?

754
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:15,395
Because I was thinking,
maybe, I'm going to get one and...

755
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:19,966
<i>But the miracle of life itself,
why people live and die,</i>

756
00:40:20,068 --> 00:40:24,053
<i>why they hurt or get
hurt, is still a mystery.</i>

757
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:27,089
Here's the thing.

758
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,325
- You're too pretty.
- Oh, come on.

759
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:33,545
No. So pretty, in fact, that
if we didn't work together,

760
00:40:33,647 --> 00:40:36,666
we would probably be...

761
00:40:38,153 --> 00:40:40,987
But, the point is,
we do work together.

762
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:43,806
And, in order for
me to do my job,

763
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:48,812
I need to leave who I am
outside the doors of this hospital.

764
00:40:48,914 --> 00:40:50,930
So...

765
00:40:52,733 --> 00:40:56,018
- Hey. You ready?
- I am.

766
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,721
You going to Joe's?
I'll come meet you.

767
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,723
Good night, Dr. Sloan.

768
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:03,492
<i>We want to know the reason,</i>

769
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:06,296
<i>the secret, the answer
at the back of the book.</i>

770
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:09,132
Do you wanna go to
dinner with me tonight?

771
00:41:11,253 --> 00:41:13,553
- I thought you weren't free.
- Turns out I am.

772
00:41:13,654 --> 00:41:18,107
And I'd like to go out with you
tonight. Do you want to go out with me?

773
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,110
That'd be nice.

774
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:22,278
<i>Because the thought</i>

775
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,764
<i>of our being all alone down here</i>

776
00:41:24,866 --> 00:41:27,316
<i>is just too much for us to bear.</i>

777
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:31,187
- How's he doing?
- Well, he's going
to be just fine.

778
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:35,074
Where's your husband?

779
00:41:35,176 --> 00:41:40,213
Uh... He went home
to get some sleep.

780
00:41:40,315 --> 00:41:44,534
And to pack his things because he's
getting himself a hotel room tonight.

781
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,703
I'm sorry.

782
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:53,693
For some reason, life just
seems to make a lot more sense

783
00:41:53,795 --> 00:41:56,078
when you're looking at a baby.

784
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,431
<i>But at the end of the day,</i>

785
00:41:58,533 --> 00:42:02,935
<i>the fact that we show
up for each other,</i>

786
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:07,222
<i>in spite of our differences,
no matter what we believe,</i>

787
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:12,695
<i>is reason enough
to keep believing.</i>
