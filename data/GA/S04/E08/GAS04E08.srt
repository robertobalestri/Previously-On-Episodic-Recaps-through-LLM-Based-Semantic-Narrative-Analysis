00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:03,913
<i>- Previously on</i> Grey's
Anatomy: - I'm Sydney.

2
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:05,504
Dr. Sydney Heron.
Big fan of your work.

3
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:07,501
- What's the matter?
- Have to start dating.

4
00:00:07,525 --> 00:00:11,142
The sex. With Izzie. It's
like she's trying too hard.

5
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:13,272
- I got fired.
- The problem with you
and your sister?

6
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:15,780
- Not my sister.
- Same dad.

7
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:17,649
You killed my wife!
You took her from me.

8
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:21,153
- What do you need? Scotch, vodka, gin?
- Don't tell Meredith.

9
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:26,491
<i>There comes a point in your
life when you're officially an adult.</i>

10
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,045
<i>Suddenly, you're old
enough to vote, drink,</i>

11
00:00:31,147 --> 00:00:33,781
<i>and engage in
other adult activities.</i>

12
00:00:33,883 --> 00:00:38,720
So why the brain? Why
biology's crown jewel?

13
00:00:38,823 --> 00:00:41,089
Why did I go into neurosurgery?

14
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:43,625
Something must have
stirred you as a youngster.

15
00:00:43,727 --> 00:00:46,077
Come on. Share.
Share with Sydney.

16
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:50,449
It was the headset, with the magnifying
glasses that tipped the scale for me.

17
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:56,538
And the man has a sense
of humor. I like that. Yes, I do.

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,575
<i>Suddenly, people expect
you to be responsible.</i>

19
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:02,694
<i>Serious. A grown-up.</i>

20
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:05,238
- Oh.
- Oh?

21
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,748
- Work stuff.
- OK.

22
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,967
As if you didn't
know. I'll just be a sec.

23
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,402
Oh.

24
00:01:12,723 --> 00:01:15,724
I think they're on a date.
That's definitely a date, right?

25
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:19,244
- Maybe she's dying.
- Is she dying? Is that why?

26
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:24,182
Grow up. She's nice. Asked me out.
You said I should see other people.

27
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,885
Want me to fake a heart
attack? I do a great heart attack.

28
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:28,548
- Here she comes.
- Carry on.

29
00:01:28,572 --> 00:01:30,333
- Oh, it's Sydney.
- In the movies,

30
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:33,024
when the handsome, but
sensitive, football player

31
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:37,129
kisses the awkward, freaky girl in
front of the school, that girl is her.

32
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,747
You are very awkward and freaky.

33
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:45,403
<i>We get taller...</i>

34
00:01:46,624 --> 00:01:48,256
<i>We get older...</i>

35
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:53,244
<i>But do we ever really grow up?</i>

36
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,550
You know what kind
of batteries these take?

37
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:01,002
- Double A.
- Is it really? Do you have one?

38
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,939
I have some in my locker. Yeah.

39
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:12,530
- We're avoiding 'em. It's come to that.
- Why are you avoiding Izzie?

40
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:16,502
Like we're not us anymore.
Everything used to be so easy.

41
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:20,038
Talking, at least, used to be easy.
Now we can't even talk anymore.

42
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,340
And you?

43
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:24,976
Derek went on a date with
Sydney Heron last night.

44
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:28,347
Probably a fake date to make me
think he's healthy and moving on.

45
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:29,881
Do you think he is?

46
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,084
- Can we take the stairs?
- OK.

47
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:37,523
<i>Dr. Fletcher to Pediatrics.
Dr. Fletcher to Pediatrics.</i>

48
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:43,244
Bailey. I, uh... just
wanted to congratulate you

49
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:45,446
on getting picked
for Chief Resident.

50
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:49,017
- I'm sorry if things got...
- You deserved the job.

51
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:52,337
Does she ever! Come here,
new Chief Resident, huh?

52
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,240
- Someone deserves a big hug.
- Oh, come on. Sydney.

53
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,592
Well, I admit I'm
a wee bit jealous.

54
00:02:57,694 --> 00:03:00,495
The Chief has made his
decision, and I will abide by it.

55
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:04,282
Oh, Callie. I'm,
uh... I'm so sorry.

56
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,267
Don't be. I'm...
I'm fine with it.

57
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:08,570
Oh, good. We're
being a brave soldier.

58
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,422
No, I really. I'm fine with it.

59
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,943
Let's not spoil this
moment for Miranda, OK?

60
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,795
All right, listen up.

61
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:21,733
I have nothing but respect
for the job done by Dr. Torres,

62
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:24,369
but things are gonna be
different from here on in.

63
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:28,023
Things are weird between George
and me. We can't hold a conversation...

64
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,725
This will be a
professional environment.

65
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:33,545
So your love lives,
your hopes and dreams,

66
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,715
the little joys and tragedies
that make you who you are

67
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,561
have no place in my hospital.

68
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,320
He's acting like a stranger,
like I don't even know him.

69
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:44,339
The locker room is for
changing, not for crying.

70
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:46,608
The on-call room is for napping,

71
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,228
not for anything that
requires a locked door.

72
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,813
And, my God, don't even
get me started on the sex.

73
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:54,916
- It is tragic. It's like...
- Did you hear a word I said?

74
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,587
Grow up, I believe, is my point.

75
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:03,791
Dr. Bailey? Can you make sure I
stay on Dr. Hahn's cardio service?

76
00:04:03,893 --> 00:04:06,712
Already done. But if you
piss her off or mess up

77
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:09,747
or in any way embarrass
me, that's it. No more chances.

78
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,100
Thank you. I'll be the
best resident she's had.

79
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:15,420
No, Yang, I will be the
best resident she's ever had.

80
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,255
Yes. Right. Second to you.

81
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,757
Chief... Resident.

82
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,245
His incision is healing nicely. No
erythema or purulent discharge.

83
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:28,282
He'll be monitored, we'll wean him
off the drip once meds are maximized.

84
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:31,536
After discharge, we expect
him to follow up in the clinic.

85
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,590
There are four other people.
How about letting them talk?

86
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:40,612
Uh...

87
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:44,715
Mr. Talbot's cardiomyopathy is
unusually complicated, that's all.

88
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,602
You could take a
cue from Dr. Stevens.

89
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,739
She knows what's going on
with patients and she's inclusive.

90
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:56,189
- What do we got?
- High school bus crash.

91
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,330
Bunch of kids just came
in. We got more on the way.

92
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:01,149
Tricia Hale, 17,
vital signs stable.

93
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:04,719
Sustained a large facial laceration,
trauma to the buttock area,

94
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:06,554
open fracture to
the lower right leg.

95
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:08,656
- Trauma Room Two.
- Still bleeding.

96
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:11,259
- My face is bleeding.
- We'll get to that in a minute.

97
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:13,911
We? No, try the head
of plastic surgery.

98
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:18,133
No one is touching my face until
I've spoken to the head. No one.

99
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,601
Thirty-four-year-old
passenger, Marcus King.

100
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:23,704
No complaints except
deep cuts on his left arm.

101
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,540
- Stable en route.
- OK.

102
00:05:25,642 --> 00:05:28,760
- I'm fine. Help the kids.
- They're being taken care of.

103
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:29,745
What happened?

104
00:05:29,847 --> 00:05:32,163
Bus slid down an embankment.

105
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,781
One, two, three.

106
00:05:36,653 --> 00:05:38,003
Mandi?

107
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,756
Mandi!

108
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:43,257
Marcus?

109
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,679
Mandi?

110
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,449
You're from Stockton?

111
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:53,552
Mr. King was taking us juniors
on a tour of the colleges up here.

112
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:57,322
Which means that our parents
are at least six or seven hours away.

113
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:58,424
Yeah.

114
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,065
Just wonderful.

115
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,534
This the eye?

116
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,420
- What's your name?
- Danny.

117
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:16,224
OK, Danny, I'm going to take
this off so I can have a look. OK?

118
00:06:30,774 --> 00:06:33,558
Man, high school
really does suck.

119
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:45,353
It was that asshat Sully
and his stupid friends!

120
00:06:45,455 --> 00:06:47,488
Driver kept telling
them to shut up.

121
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,191
I'm drawing a logo, and
suddenly I'm upside down.

122
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:52,133
Pencil went all the
way in Danny's eye.

123
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,971
- I see that.
- Does it hurt?

124
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,064
No, it feels like a
soothing bubble bath.

125
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,043
- What do you think?!
- I think it hurts.

126
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:00,885
Look straight ahead for
me. Try not to move your eye.

127
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,771
- Should I call his parents?
- Why don't you let us?

128
00:07:03,874 --> 00:07:06,992
Those jerks should be in jail.
Call the police, not parents.

129
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:10,929
Don't think about them. You'll be
out soon and never have to see them.

130
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,059
- Still got to finish.
- Need to calm down.

131
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,983
When you raise
your voice, get upset,

132
00:07:15,084 --> 00:07:17,502
your blood pressure shoots
up, could lose your eye.

133
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,621
- I need you to stay calm.
- OK. I'll try.

134
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:25,860
Listen, I really can't
feel what you're doing,

135
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:28,697
but I hope you're not
leaving a big old scar.

136
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:31,215
No! No, no, no.

137
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,969
Just a few little stitches.
Just... I do stitches all the time.

138
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:37,188
You want me to
take over, Dr. Bailey?

139
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,535
No. I do stitches all
the time, O'Malley.

140
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:43,127
I thought with all the serious
injuries, you'd want me to take over.

141
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:46,214
I'm fine here. You're
not the boss of me.

142
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:50,218
Interns.

143
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,903
Actually, I'm the boss of
him, if you'd want to know.

144
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,506
I'm the Chief Resident.

145
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,374
- What?
- Yeah.

146
00:07:56,477 --> 00:08:00,027
Oh, Mandi. You know
something? I'm not surprised.

147
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:03,180
- Know that we went
to high school together?
- Really?

148
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:06,234
Yeah, and this girl
here, she is a genius.

149
00:08:06,336 --> 00:08:11,239
- Used to help me
with my homework.
- Just a few papers, that's all.

150
00:08:11,341 --> 00:08:12,581
Oh. Oops.

151
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:14,892
- Dr. Bailey?
- I do stitches all the time.

152
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,714
You might want to take a listen.

153
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:19,664
- Something wrong with
my ticker?
- OK.

154
00:08:31,628 --> 00:08:36,615
Um, part of your heart
may be working overtime.

155
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:40,852
So, I will get his
EKG and page Hahn.

156
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:45,372
- Will you finish the sutures?
- You can't finish this?

157
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:50,979
I guess... I can do it.

158
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:53,131
Sure, I'll do it.

159
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,537
- OK.
- You better be able
to fix my face.

160
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,023
I have pom
statewides in a month.

161
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,925
Which is...?

162
00:09:04,027 --> 00:09:07,011
It's a competition. Poms.

163
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:08,223
Pom routines.

164
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,948
- You're a cheerleader?
- I'm a pom.

165
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,336
Cheerleaders just jump
around. Poms are dancers.

166
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,722
I was on the football team.

167
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:20,558
Not sure you're doing any
dancing in the next month.

168
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,427
- You better be lying.
- Not lying.

169
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:26,180
You have serious knee and leg
fractures. Not to mention a cracked coccyx.

170
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:27,766
What the hell is that?

171
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:30,652
- The bone at the bottom
of your spine.
- Huh?

172
00:09:30,754 --> 00:09:34,789
- The bottom of your bottom.
- My ass? I broke my ass?

173
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:39,644
- That's one way to look at it.
- Don't look at it.

174
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,914
You're going to need surgery,
but we'll put you under so that

175
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,650
we can fix the bones and
Dr. Sloan can fix your face

176
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,319
- all at the same time.
- You better be good.

177
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:52,073
I am, but there may
still be a little scarring.

178
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,725
Scarring? On my face?

179
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:59,647
Call my mother right now.
I'm finding somebody else.

180
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,684
Baby, you're not going to
find anybody better than me.

181
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,874
Oh, my God. Hot cheerleader ass.

182
00:10:11,227 --> 00:10:15,013
"Take a cue from Stevens."
From Izzie Stevens. Seriously?

183
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,999
So many insults running
in my head, I can't pick one.

184
00:10:18,101 --> 00:10:21,018
Need to cut Izzie slack. Her
and George are having problems.

185
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,688
Already? Only been a week.
That point you don't talk.

186
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,391
- All you do is have sex.
- Doesn't mean you can't
have problems.

187
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,878
Derek and I are having sex,
and he's dating other people.

188
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,314
- You didn't hear any of this.
- Oh, please.

189
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:37,335
- Don't even think about it.
- We were in an accident.

190
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,070
We're traumatized.

191
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,408
Fine. Whatever.

192
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,277
Paged me because you
couldn't handle stitches on a wino?

193
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:50,581
Hollering for Dr. Grey. Wasn't sure
if I should get her or call the cops.

194
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:56,404
That's not Dr. Grey.
Dr. Grey's a girl!

195
00:10:56,506 --> 00:10:58,606
I want my daughter! Alex Karev!

196
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,958
Stay here. Make
sure he doesn't leave.

197
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:05,230
- Did you page... page her?
- Karev.

198
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,917
Keep Meredith
out of it. Get Lexie.

199
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:12,320
- Yes, sir.
- G-R-E-Y!

200
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:16,277
- Come on!
- I need to talk
to you about your dad.

201
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,910
Know what? I don't
want to talk about my dad.

202
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:25,066
We're never gonna talk about him again.
You helped me out once. Now it's over.

203
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:31,750
I can't believe I got
to fill out all this stuff.

204
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,694
I mean, a kid gets
a bump on the head

205
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,377
and you've practically
got to write a novel?

206
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:41,883
I know you're really busy,
but if there's any chance at all

207
00:11:41,985 --> 00:11:43,963
you could help
me out with this...

208
00:11:43,987 --> 00:11:46,227
Patient fill those
out. Not the doctor.

209
00:11:46,256 --> 00:11:48,973
You be quiet. Don't
worry about it, Marcus.

210
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,392
- We'll figure out something.
- Good old Mandi.

211
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:54,245
- You always got my back, huh?
- You hush now.

212
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:58,933
I hate to interrupt the reminiscing,
but I am trying to listen here.

213
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,506
You do have atrial fibrillation.

214
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:07,792
You're not symptomatic,
that's a good sign.

215
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:11,845
We'll start you on blood thinners
and do an outpatient workup.

216
00:12:11,947 --> 00:12:15,232
A treatment plan you could
have made yourself, Dr. Bailey,

217
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,486
if you weren't acting
like such a blithering idiot.

218
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:24,341
Oh, teacher's pet's in trouble!

219
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:27,678
Oh, come on, now.
Hush now, Marcus King.

220
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,882
Hey, you paged me.

221
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,544
- Yeah, your dad's here.
- What?

222
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:35,420
He's drunk, noisy, and you
need to take him off my hands.

223
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,183
I have a broken
ass to get back to.

224
00:12:37,207 --> 00:12:40,108
- Call Lexie.
- I called Lexie,
she's not coming.

225
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,554
Next person I'm calling
is the cops because

226
00:12:42,578 --> 00:12:45,613
the guy's ready to get out,
and there's no way he can drive.

227
00:12:45,715 --> 00:12:48,015
Get out! Leave
me alone! Meredith!

228
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:53,921
Gosh, it's good to see you.
See, that's her! Meredith Grey!

229
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:06,033
- I'm sorry. I really, really am.
- I'm sure you are.

230
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:08,102
Not just for this.

231
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:13,224
The last time I was here, I
said some terrible things to you.

232
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:16,672
Telling you not to come to
Susan's funeral? It wasn't your fault.

233
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:21,032
What happened to her, I know that.
I know you did everything you could.

234
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:25,736
You're a good doctor.
You're a fine person.

235
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,773
What I said to you...

236
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,112
I'll regret it until
the day I die.

237
00:13:35,832 --> 00:13:38,349
And the drinking...

238
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,519
It's unacceptable.

239
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,622
I... I don't.

240
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:46,190
Very... very rarely.

241
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,759
But today...

242
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:57,602
Today is Susan's
birthday, and I...

243
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:06,627
- Should I go get Lexie?
- No. Just you.

244
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:08,512
I just want you.

245
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:18,005
I never knew what to say to
them. In high school, kids like him.

246
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,892
I always felt so sorry for them.

247
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:26,013
They were always so...
separate from the rest of us.

248
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,951
Alone. Wasn't like that for me.

249
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:33,020
I was prom queen
and class valedictorian.

250
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,956
Yeah, I wouldn't broadcast that.

251
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:39,811
Even beyond that, I had a
great group of friends, you know?

252
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:45,032
- Not really.
- Hey. Let me see
what we got here.

253
00:14:46,736 --> 00:14:48,502
See that, Dr. Stevens?

254
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:52,974
Yeah. Looks like the pencil lifted
up one of the branches of the ACA.

255
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,894
- Is that a bleed?
- It is. It's a little one.

256
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:58,963
We need to get that pencil
out before it gets any bigger.

257
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,581
I'll book an OR.

258
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:06,503
I am not a blithering idiot.

259
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:10,674
Hahn had no right to speak
to me that way. No right at all.

260
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,576
Marcus isn't a...

261
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:16,296
Well, he's just not an
old friend, is he? Is he?

262
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,069
He was, maybe, a boyfriend or...
You know, high school sweetheart or...

263
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,921
I was his tutor. OK?

264
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,958
He was a track star, didn't
have a lot of time for homework.

265
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,426
So I helped him with his math.

266
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,611
And reading.

267
00:15:30,713 --> 00:15:35,983
And French. Chemistry.

268
00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:39,186
And he was just a friend?

269
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,522
Really?

270
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,575
OK, there was some talk.

271
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:47,612
The possibility of us going
to the homecoming together,

272
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:51,316
but it didn't work out,
and I was fine with that.

273
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,952
Certainly not a
blithering idiot.

274
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:59,756
Today nor any
other day in my life.

275
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,962
That, that and that. Thank you.

276
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:12,219
Is it me or are there
teenyboppers staring at you?

277
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,204
I get that a lot.

278
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:18,475
It started when I was their
age. It never really went away.

279
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,112
Is that so?

280
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:24,681
Come on. Let's go over
there. Come on! Come on!

281
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:28,585
- What can I do for you ladies?
- Tell him.

282
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:31,588
- No. It's embarrassing.
- You can tell me.

283
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:35,176
You look like
exactly like her dad.

284
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,618
Swing and a miss!

285
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,554
I'm crazy with this Hahn thing.
Every time I try and impress her,

286
00:16:47,657 --> 00:16:49,089
she hates me even more.

287
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:56,214
Not worth getting hung up on.

288
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:57,849
Why? Did something happen?

289
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:01,702
Apparently, they're not even
talking to each other at this point.

290
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:03,688
But I didn't say anything.

291
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:08,125
I know it's wrong, but
that makes me feel better.

292
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,227
Oh, thanks.

293
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,694
You're not going to sit?

294
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:13,664
Um, I was going to, but I need
to cram. I got a big surgery today.

295
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,600
We're operating on the kid
with the pencil. I'll see you.

296
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,142
- OK, see you around.
- OK.

297
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:21,255
- OK, got that.
- She be able to sit
on her butt,

298
00:17:21,357 --> 00:17:24,591
or carry around one of those
toilet seats for the rest of her life?

299
00:17:24,694 --> 00:17:27,011
She'll have use of
her butt in a few weeks.

300
00:17:29,332 --> 00:17:32,483
I am so honored to be
filling in for you as captain.

301
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,503
You're filling in
for me as captain?

302
00:17:35,605 --> 00:17:40,140
Well, somebody's got to. I prayed on
it. God seems to think it's the right move.

303
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:44,228
- Oh, OK.
- And I don't want you to worry.

304
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,174
Called Randy. I
might've convinced him

305
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:49,934
to take you to homecoming, even
though your face and butt's messed up.

306
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:52,230
Bet he'll take you.
He's classy that way.

307
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:55,534
OK, so now that we've established
that Randy's a classy guy,

308
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:59,110
- visiting time is over.
- Bye, sweetie.

309
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:02,012
- I hope they don't ruin
your face.
- Go!

310
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:08,919
Kind of sucks, huh?
When they turn on you?

311
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,572
Little manicured vultures.

312
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:16,961
My life is over.
My life is over!

313
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,265
Mom?

314
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:24,368
I'll be fine.

315
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,036
It'll be fine.

316
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,308
I know.

317
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,576
I love you, too.

318
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:36,514
Will you... Will you tell Dad...

319
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,583
Hello? Hello?

320
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,640
Thanks to your piece of crap
phone, my mom's going to think I died.

321
00:18:48,912 --> 00:18:50,578
Oh...

322
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,882
- This is where...
- Yeah. But we'll keep you updated.

323
00:18:56,786 --> 00:18:58,753
Hey.

324
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,109
You better not end up blind and go
to some blind kid's school because,

325
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:08,662
if I have to go back to
junior year without you,

326
00:19:08,764 --> 00:19:10,982
you're going to be dead meat.

327
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:18,288
- Later, freak.
- You're the freak.

328
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:21,258
- You are.
- You are.

329
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,231
<i>♪ This is the last one ♪</i>

330
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,737
<i>♪ This is the last one ♪</i>

331
00:19:37,794 --> 00:19:41,495
<i>♪ This is the last one ♪</i>

332
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:45,783
- How's the bleeding?
- Slight. Very controllable.

333
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:49,045
Promised life gets better after
high school. Deserves to see that.

334
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:53,524
Got a good friend. That's something.
That girl's been by his bedside all day.

335
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,810
Even so, those
cliques are miserable.

336
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:58,346
He needs to know
it passes, eventually.

337
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,651
Sorry, Dr. Shepherd.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

338
00:20:04,753 --> 00:20:06,119
What's so funny?

339
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:12,276
I'm not sure we've come as far
as you'd like to think. Clique-wise.

340
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:16,030
- We?
- The hospital.

341
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,666
- Think the hospital's cliquey?
- You don't?

342
00:20:18,768 --> 00:20:21,134
Oh, damn it. The artery's burst.

343
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:25,940
The pericallosal artery. Brain is
swelling. Cutting off the blood supply.

344
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:29,093
OK, push 80 grams of
mannitol. OK, let's go!

345
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:35,065
How do I tell his best friend
that he's going to be in a coma

346
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:39,019
- for the rest of his life?
- You can't tell her yet, Derek.

347
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:41,472
The family has to know first.

348
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:42,873
They're still on a plane.

349
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:46,009
- I understand that, but...
- Danny's doctor.

350
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:49,513
Oh, thank God. Only been
a few hours without Danny,

351
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:51,982
I'm already
starting to freak out.

352
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,319
I mean, look what I have to
put up with. They're crying.

353
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:59,022
Like real tears because
they're so worried about Danny,

354
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,226
which would be fine if
they knew who Danny was.

355
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:06,914
Whatever. Can I see him?

356
00:21:09,151 --> 00:21:11,469
He hasn't woken up yet.

357
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:14,838
He's OK?

358
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,874
Soon as I know
something, I'll let you know.

359
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:20,344
OK.

360
00:21:28,304 --> 00:21:31,872
- Think she'll recover
full function?
- Hope so. If she doesn't

361
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:34,975
get back on the pom-pom
brigade, her life is totally over.

362
00:21:35,077 --> 00:21:36,727
Is that what she said?

363
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:40,480
After the band of harpies she thought
were her friends picked over her carcass.

364
00:21:40,582 --> 00:21:42,344
You'd think, way they treat her,

365
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:45,118
she'd be ready to ditch
the whole thing, but no.

366
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,306
She's not going to walk away from
that. It's her life. It's her identity.

367
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,925
Only way she understands
herself in the world.

368
00:21:52,027 --> 00:21:56,279
Mm-hm. Heard one of the sweet young
things told Mark he looked like her dad.

369
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:58,349
Harsh.

370
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,451
What does that have
to do with anything?

371
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,903
You seem really
empathetic to her plight.

372
00:22:03,005 --> 00:22:08,708
You know, loss of identity?
Shattered self-image?

373
00:22:08,811 --> 00:22:11,095
You seem happy about
what happened to her.

374
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:15,782
Torres is just happy because
Stevens and O'Malley hit the skids.

375
00:22:15,884 --> 00:22:18,802
Didn't I tell you
not to tell anybody?

376
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,212
I pulled the X-rays for
tomorrow's scheduled surgeries.

377
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,598
And what am I supposed
to do with them?

378
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,485
Thought I could put them in
the OR if you needed me to.

379
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,420
Well, I don't.

380
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,060
- Back off.
- What?

381
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:47,364
- You're being a brownnoser.
- I am not a brownnoser.

382
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:48,965
I'm helping her.

383
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:52,619
Annoying her. Got a chance to show
what you can do, you're blowing it.

384
00:22:52,721 --> 00:22:56,456
Trust me, these kind of chances
do not come around all the time.

385
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:58,275
So, you know, just back off.

386
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:04,031
Back off...

387
00:23:06,535 --> 00:23:09,369
I'm sorry I didn't know you
when you were in high school.

388
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:13,874
I've regretted it every
day, not knowing you.

389
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,111
Not being there.

390
00:23:18,214 --> 00:23:20,447
Sometimes I still
worry about you.

391
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:23,984
Other times I think, you know,
maybe it's what made you so strong.

392
00:23:24,086 --> 00:23:26,386
Not an excuse, not at all.

393
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,759
You are so strong.
You're stronger than Lexie.

394
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:38,264
- I don't know her that well.
- Well, true.

395
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:43,253
You're a very impressive
person, Meredith.

396
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,973
I'm so proud of you.

397
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:53,964
I'm a lifetime's worth of proud.

398
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:56,500
Anyway...

399
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:59,236
Anyway, old man's rambling.

400
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:01,972
Thank you.

401
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:09,730
Hey. How was your
date with Sydney?

402
00:24:09,832 --> 00:24:13,116
Wondering when you
were going to bring that up.

403
00:24:16,605 --> 00:24:19,106
- My dad's in the ER.
- Really?

404
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,308
He cut himself.

405
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:25,478
He's not bad company, actually.
He's quite funny and charming.

406
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,130
Drunk.

407
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,952
Is it weird that I like my drunk
dad better than my regular dad?

408
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,887
A little.

409
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:41,145
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, um...

410
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,715
My patient's in a coma and he's
never going to wake up again.

411
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,185
His best friend is
in the waiting area.

412
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:51,538
Poor thing thinks he's...

413
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,174
She thinks he's going
to wake up any second.

414
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,244
I don't know.

415
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,420
I don't believe
it. Who told you?

416
00:25:06,522 --> 00:25:08,767
Henry. He was observing
in Sloan's surgery,

417
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:11,525
and he said that Sloan
announced it to the whole OR.

418
00:25:11,627 --> 00:25:15,929
- Wow. O'Malley
and Stevens are done.
- Yeah.

419
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:18,348
- They didn't even last a week.
- I know.

420
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,866
Tragic.

421
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,240
Can I have the key
back, to my house?

422
00:25:27,342 --> 00:25:28,842
Hey. What?

423
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,495
Key. To my house? I want
it back. I heard we broke up.

424
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:33,477
- Can I have it?
- Don't have any idea

425
00:25:33,515 --> 00:25:36,416
- what you're talking about.
- Everyone's talking about

426
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:38,652
the fact we broke up.
Who you been talking to?

427
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:40,937
Nobody. I mean, to Meredith.

428
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,872
I knew it! What exactly
did you say to her?

429
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:47,528
Nothing I... What do you mean
you knew it? You been talking to her?

430
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:52,416
Yeah. But only after
you were talking to her.

431
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:54,796
So I'm not the only one
who talked to her, then.

432
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,436
You talked to her first!

433
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:15,622
What is my dad doing here?

434
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,425
Your dad came in
drunk this morning.

435
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:21,311
That's what I was trying to
tell you when you blew me off.

436
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,881
So you run to Meredith?

437
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:26,500
The one person that I
asked you not to tell?

438
00:26:26,602 --> 00:26:30,553
- I was trying to help, OK?
- Right.

439
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:39,513
And what about Linda Russell,
do you have her contact info?

440
00:26:39,615 --> 00:26:44,084
You know you haven't
changed? I mean, not even one bit.

441
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:48,705
You get this very intense look on your
face when you're serious, you know?

442
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:52,475
It's your serious
homework doing face.

443
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:55,429
- Hasn't changed.
- Dr. Bailey.

444
00:26:56,899 --> 00:27:00,000
Is that a patient form
I see in your hand?

445
00:27:00,102 --> 00:27:02,368
Yes, I suppose it is.

446
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,838
You're not supposed
to fill out patient forms.

447
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,906
Patients are
supposed to fill forms.

448
00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:09,676
You have work to
do. Your own work.

449
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:12,479
- Yes, sir.
- Mandi?

450
00:27:12,581 --> 00:27:15,715
- Mandi?
- Mandi, I'm not...

451
00:27:15,817 --> 00:27:18,051
- I'm not feeling so...
- Marcus? Marcus!

452
00:27:18,153 --> 00:27:20,554
- Pulse ox is dropping.
- Pressure's 82 over 48.

453
00:27:20,656 --> 00:27:24,474
Tell Radiology we need a stat
spiral CT, and page Dr. Hahn.

454
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,160
- Dr. Shepherd?
- Marissa.

455
00:27:27,263 --> 00:27:28,473
Is he awake yet?

456
00:27:28,497 --> 00:27:30,130
No, not yet.

457
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:33,733
I know Danny's parents aren't going
to be here for a couple more hours,

458
00:27:33,835 --> 00:27:37,988
but could I at least
see him? Please?

459
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:42,425
All right, come on.
Let's go sit down.

460
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,342
The...

461
00:28:02,364 --> 00:28:06,532
When I removed the
pencil, the artery burst.

462
00:28:08,204 --> 00:28:11,454
When the brain swells that
much, it has nowhere to go.

463
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,111
The hem...

464
00:28:42,237 --> 00:28:44,338
Hey.

465
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,341
I would like to announce that I
am getting two cups of coffee.

466
00:28:47,443 --> 00:28:52,162
Two. One for me, one
for my dad. He's here.

467
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:55,549
It's not horrible.
What's wrong with you?

468
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:59,069
At this exact moment in OR Two,

469
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:02,572
Dr. Hahn is performing a
pulmonary embolectomy.

470
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:06,059
- A pulmonary embolectomy. Meredith.
- So what's the problem?

471
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,428
- You're on her service. Go.
- No, I can't.

472
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:12,015
That'd make me a brownnoser,
and everybody hates brownnosers.

473
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,984
I cannot be a brownnoser.

474
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:20,874
OK. There'll be other embolectomies.
You can let this one slide.

475
00:29:20,976 --> 00:29:22,526
No, no, no! No, I can't!

476
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:26,863
I don't know how to just let a
pulmonary embolectomy slide!

477
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:29,332
Sure you can. It's
like cutting a class.

478
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,740
- You never cut a class.
- Never. Not once.

479
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:38,058
Ha.

480
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:47,251
That was a pretty
big VSD on the echo.

481
00:29:47,353 --> 00:29:51,388
Going to have to do an additional
arteriotomy of the right PA.

482
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,918
- It should never
have come to this.
- I'm sorry?

483
00:29:53,942 --> 00:29:57,711
You should've taken the situation
seriously, ordered further tests.

484
00:29:57,813 --> 00:30:00,130
Maybe I should have.
Maybe you should have.

485
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:04,701
And if you weren't so busy flirting with
the patient like a lovestruck teenager,

486
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,437
maybe you would have.

487
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,007
Forceps, please.

488
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:15,946
This is so sad. I used to
walk by his house every day.

489
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:18,715
He was in my
algebra class, I think.

490
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:25,088
Marissa.

491
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:31,244
I know that this seems impossible
right now, but you will get through this.

492
00:30:31,346 --> 00:30:35,365
- Danny would've wanted you to.
- Don't know what he would've
wanted.

493
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,233
You're just like them.

494
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:41,571
You're a prom queen and you're trying
to act like you know what it's like for me.

495
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,193
You have no idea what it's like.

496
00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:48,828
I wasn't a prom queen.

497
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:55,418
I was the girl in the cheap clothes
from the trailer park who got pregnant,

498
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,605
and got thrown in the
pregnant girls' class.

499
00:30:58,707 --> 00:31:00,523
I lost all my friends.

500
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,560
None of the mothers would
let their kids hang out with me.

501
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:10,133
But I got through it.
You will get through this.

502
00:31:10,218 --> 00:31:13,153
I'm going to write a
letter to his mom and dad.

503
00:31:13,255 --> 00:31:14,972
That's really beautiful.

504
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:16,889
- Get out.
- What?

505
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:18,603
You're not supposed
to be in here.

506
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:22,345
- She's here.
- She's his friend. His best friend.

507
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:25,682
Go away. Go!

508
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:32,004
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- It's OK.

509
00:31:33,908 --> 00:31:38,211
You just lost your best friend.
It's the worst thing in the world.

510
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:46,419
- I won't repeat a word.
- Thank you.

511
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:52,025
- Dr. Shepherd?
- Yes.

512
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:56,480
I'm sorry. About Danny Metcalf.
It looked like it was hard on you.

513
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,800
Which is good. If I had
a son going through that,

514
00:31:59,902 --> 00:32:04,538
I'd want the surgeon to be
fully invested, like you were.

515
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,573
You have no idea
who I am, do you?

516
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,476
Course I do.

517
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,979
Bye, Dr. Shepherd.

518
00:32:14,282 --> 00:32:17,717
You're the nurse in OR Two.
The one that talked about cliques?

519
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:19,218
Yeah, right?

522

Once we get your knee moving,
we can get you out of bed,

523
00:32:28,597 --> 00:32:31,380
and then you can start
putting some weight on it.

524
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:33,628
But I won't be able
to dance for a year?

525
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:35,802
Probably not.

526
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:41,391
Sometimes...

527
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:45,028
when things don't work out the
way you planned, there's gifts...

528
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:49,616
You're gonna give me some
stupid speech about silver linings?

529
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,569
I am never going
to be captain again.

530
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,576
I was fired from a
job recently, and...

531
00:33:00,662 --> 00:33:03,963
You were fired from being a
doctor, and they let you cut my ass?

532
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:07,234
OK, shut your trap for eight
seconds and let me finish.

533
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:14,307
I didn't get fired from being a
doctor. I got fired from being, like...

534
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,077
Well, our version
of squad captain.

535
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,947
Which is mostly
about organizing crap.

536
00:33:22,217 --> 00:33:25,251
- Not about surgery.
- So?

537
00:33:25,353 --> 00:33:30,356
So... I got to go back
to the part that I like.

538
00:33:31,326 --> 00:33:34,927
Which... It's kind of a gift.

539
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:45,221

00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:14,234
Apparently when you ask for
copies of the CT angio around here,

551
00:34:14,336 --> 00:34:19,088
people think it's all right to just give
you the slices that contain the clot.

552
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:23,226
Can you please bring
me the entire CT?

553
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:25,811
Absolutely. Yes, absolutely.
I'll do that right now.

556
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:40,710
- Your dad was in the ER today.
- I know.

557
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:43,646
You know he was drunk and he
put his hand through a window?

558
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:47,767
- Yeah. Anything else?
- I know it was Susan's
birthday,

559
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:51,388
and I'm sure it was a very
hard day for the both of you.

560
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,623
And he wasn't
actually a problem.

561
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:57,460
He was kind of charming,
but he seemed very sad,

562
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,896
and I'd hate to see
it happen again.

563
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:03,733
So, maybe, you should think
about keeping a better eye on him.

564
00:35:09,224 --> 00:35:11,674
Every day is my
mother's birthday.

565
00:35:13,929 --> 00:35:17,864
My mother was born
in March. He lied.

566
00:35:17,966 --> 00:35:20,616
He's a liar. And I'm glad.

567
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,136
Really, I'm glad that
you found him charming.

568
00:35:23,238 --> 00:35:26,456
I'm sure he was delightful.
He's a blast after five drinks.

569
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:29,759
Not so much after nine, though.
He gets a little weepy and mean.

570
00:35:29,862 --> 00:35:31,444
He's a drunk, Meredith.

571
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,964
He probably came in and
told you how wonderful you are.

572
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:38,051
How sad he is that he doesn't
get to spend more time with you.

573
00:35:38,153 --> 00:35:42,104
You know, yesterday he said
that I was his favorite daughter.

574
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:44,741
The day before, I was
an ungrateful bitch.

575
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:47,878
The week before, he wrote
me a check for 20,000 dollars

576
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,814
because he said I deserved
everything life had to offer.

577
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:55,084
Because he was so proud of
me. A lifetime's worth of proud.

578
00:35:56,488 --> 00:36:00,440
So you can't listen to anything
he says because it's not about you.

579
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:03,008
It's about a pint and
a half of Dewar's.

580
00:36:03,111 --> 00:36:04,777
So thank you for letting me know

581
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:08,014
that I need to keep a
better eye on him. Thanks.

582
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:23,880
Meredith, you want to come
in for a minute and sit down?

583
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:29,252
Meredith?

584
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:42,615
- I'm sorry about all this.
- Meredith, please.

585
00:36:42,717 --> 00:36:45,434
You have nothing to
apologize for. Nothing at all.

586
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,582
I'm keeping you
from doing your job.

587
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:49,990
This is my job.
At least part of it.

588
00:36:50,092 --> 00:36:53,410
Think of it as the
principal's office.

589
00:36:53,512 --> 00:36:56,128
Only I'm the nice principal.

590
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:58,814
Anyway, I promised your
mom I'd take care of you.

591
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,833
I told you, you
don't have to do that.

592
00:37:00,935 --> 00:37:04,987
I know. I know
I don't. But I do.

593
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:21,838
- Hey, you.
- Hey, you.

594
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,808
I guess I'm still alive
and kicking, huh?

595
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:31,781
You had a clot that traveled to
your lungs, but we got to it in time.

596
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:38,054
So you're going to be kicking for a
good long time now, Marcus King.

597
00:37:47,115 --> 00:37:49,048
Mandi.

598
00:37:50,085 --> 00:37:52,605
You have always been my angel.

599
00:37:54,222 --> 00:37:56,272
Always have been. I just...

600
00:37:56,374 --> 00:38:00,560
I never would've made it
through high school without you.

601
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:05,381
I never would've made it
through this day without you.

602
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:07,366
- Come on now.
- Mandi, I mean it.

603
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:12,572
Thank you. I thank you.

604
00:38:12,674 --> 00:38:15,107
My mama thanks you.

605
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,388
And you know my
daddy thanks you.

606
00:38:17,412 --> 00:38:22,014
You tell your mama and daddy
that I said they're welcome.

607
00:38:24,252 --> 00:38:26,151
Oh, hey, I was...

608
00:38:26,254 --> 00:38:29,889
I was wondering if you got a
chance to finish up that paperwork.

609
00:38:29,991 --> 00:38:33,742
I wouldn't ask, but, you know,

610
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:36,763
I think a lot of it was
kind of important.

611
00:38:36,865 --> 00:38:40,317
No, I didn't. I
was planning on...

612
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:45,187
Just got to, you know...
finish it right now.

613
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:50,209

00:41:23,415 --> 00:41:27,700
We don't exist for you. We
exist to do your homework.

657
00:41:27,802 --> 00:41:31,837
We exist to build your ego up.

658
00:41:36,377 --> 00:41:41,380
I am a successful,
married mother.

659
00:41:41,483 --> 00:41:43,882
I am Chief Resident!

660
00:41:43,985 --> 00:41:47,753
I am Chief Resident of a
major metropolitan hospital!

661
00:41:47,855 --> 00:41:51,607
I am a surgeon who
saved his life today!

662
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:01,383
And he still doesn't see me.

663
00:42:03,571 --> 00:42:06,889
I may as well still be
that high school girl

664
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:09,659
with the mushroom haircut

665
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:13,830
and the Coke bottle
glasses, and the band uniform.

666
00:42:13,932 --> 00:42:17,199
The girl who didn't get to go
to homecoming dance because

667
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:20,536
it didn't even occur
to him to ask me.

668
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:25,624
All those late nights tutoring him,
and it didn't even occur to him to ask.

669
00:42:25,726 --> 00:42:27,560
Hmm.

670
00:42:30,782 --> 00:42:33,649
Band uniform. Really?

671
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:39,939
Do I look like I'm going to
be mocked by you right now?

672
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:43,992
No, you don't. I'm just
going to say one thing.

673
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:49,331
In high school, I was a 110 pounds
and I hadn't yet figured out hair product.

674
00:42:49,417 --> 00:42:53,936
I had a big Afro and had acne.

675
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:59,708
And I, too, wore a band uniform.

676
00:43:02,597 --> 00:43:04,230
Sax.

677
00:43:06,801 --> 00:43:08,334
Oboe.

678
00:43:16,744 --> 00:43:22,348
I would have been honored to
take a girl like you to homecoming.

679
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,636
<i>In some ways we grow up.</i>

680
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:32,157
<i>We have families.
We get married...</i>

681
00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:37,096
<i>Divorced.</i>

682
00:43:38,499 --> 00:43:41,000
I was trying to think
of a long speech.

683
00:43:41,102 --> 00:43:44,870
You know, like Bailey with
her long speeches, and just...

684
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:47,840
Just everything I
wanted to say to you.

685
00:43:50,978 --> 00:43:54,563
The gist is, I can't talk to you.
That's why I talk to Meredith.

686
00:43:54,648 --> 00:43:56,808
I just... I don't know why.

687
00:43:58,819 --> 00:44:01,537
It used to be...

688
00:44:03,825 --> 00:44:05,892
It use to be...

689
00:44:07,495 --> 00:44:10,930
that I was the only person you could
talk to. And you were the only person

690
00:44:11,032 --> 00:44:12,765
- I could talk to.
- I know.

691
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:18,220
I need to be
able to talk to you.

692
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:23,575
I'm in love with this incredible
guy, and we're having problems.

693
00:44:23,677 --> 00:44:27,964
And my best friend, he would
know what to say to me about it.

694
00:44:28,066 --> 00:44:30,115
I need to be able to
talk to my best friend.

695
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:32,735
I cannot get through this
without my best friend.

696
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,703
Why isn't this easier?

697
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:38,607
I don't know.

698
00:44:40,628 --> 00:44:43,229
Well, I want my
best friend back.

699
00:44:44,298 --> 00:44:45,530
Me, too.

700
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,001
<i>But, for the most part, we
still have the same problems</i>

701
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:08,003
<i>that we did when we were 15.</i>

702
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:10,506
Hey, Rose. Rose!

703
00:45:11,976 --> 00:45:16,078
- You know my name.
- I had to ask around,
but now I know.

704
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,347
- Good for you. Good night.
- Hang on.

705
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:21,467
I should have recognized
you from the OR today.

706
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:25,187
We worked together for three
hours and... It's thoughtless.

707
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:30,492
I've worked on 36
of your surgeries,

708
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:35,264
and today was the first
time you made eye contact.

709
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:38,567
Like I said, hospital's no
better than high school.

710
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:41,687
Good night, Dr. Shepherd.

711
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:46,642
Someone figured out how
to get back on the horse.

712
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,278
What? No. Was just
talking about work.

713
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,163
Could've fooled me.

714
00:45:52,884 --> 00:45:55,118

Hiya, Sydney.

718
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:08,347
Derek, you think I just could
talk to you for one quick minute?

719
00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:11,350
Yeah. Have a seat.

720
00:46:13,787 --> 00:46:16,789

I want you to know that I really
enjoyed our date last night. I really did.

724
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,701
- I don't think
we should do it again.
- You don't?

725
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:34,306
I'm a lot of woman. OK?
I bring home the bacon.

726
00:46:34,408 --> 00:46:36,620
Fry it up in a pan, serve it
with eggs or on a sandwich,

727
00:46:36,644 --> 00:46:39,678
- or crumbled up
in a Cobb salad.
- You do a lot with bacon.

728
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,163
Not just bacon.

729
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:44,149
But, Derek, I bring a
lot of things to the table.

730
00:46:44,252 --> 00:46:46,736
And I'm looking for a
man who can do the same,

731
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:48,916
a man who can meet my needs.

732
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,639

733
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:52,986

Hmm.

00:46:55,596 --> 00:46:57,413
Well, you might be right.

736
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:00,828
I won't let this affect
our work if you won't.

737
00:47:00,852 --> 00:47:02,417
