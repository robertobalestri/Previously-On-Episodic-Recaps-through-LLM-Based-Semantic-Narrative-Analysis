1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,704
<i>My mother used to
say that for a surgeon,</i>

2
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:09,041
<i>a day without
death is a rare gift.</i>

3
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:19,451
Time of death, 11:53.

4
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,622
<i>Every day we face death.</i>

5
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:27,325
<i>Every day we lose life.</i>

6
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,632
Time of death, 18:36.

7
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:38,137
Time of death, 15:52.

8
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:45,677
<i>And every day, we're
hoping for a stay of execution.</i>

9
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:50,435
What do you remember about it?

10
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,585
We were at home.

11
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:58,956
- You were there?
- Yes, I was there.

12
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,397
It's OK to talk about it.

13
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:13,839
Dr. Wyatt, my mother took a scalpel
and sliced her wrists in front of me.

14
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:16,308
I sat on the kitchen floor
in a pool of her blood,

15
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,878
waiting until she passed
out so I could call 911.

16
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,180
It's not OK to talk about it.

17
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,951
Why did you wait
until she passed out?

18
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,255
She asked me not to
before she slit her wrists,

19
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:34,660
so I knew I would get in
trouble if I tried to save her life.

20
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,661
But you did save her life.

21
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,165
She didn't want it saved.

22
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,803
You must be very angry at her.

23
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,371
No.

24
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,341
- Not at her.
- Who are you angry at?

25
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:55,213
<i>We're attached to death.</i>

26
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:59,651
<i>Chained, like prisoners.</i>

27
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,588
<i>Captives.</i>

28
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,994
- Do you want to dance it out?
- No.

29
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,730
- Do you want to drink tequila?
- No.

30
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:16,434
Do you want to call me
names, mock me endlessly?

31
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,770
- No.
- I'm trying to cheer you up.

32
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:22,474
Yeah? Well, stop it. It's
annoying. And it's not working.

33
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:25,076
I'm deep in the wilderness here.

34
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,948
Do you want the sparkle pager?

35
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,686
- That's not funny.
- You're sad. Actually sad.

36
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,623
I know it's the right thing
to do to give you the pager.

37
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:39,691
You're so sad,
you're not asking me.

38
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:44,262
I'm giving it to you. Shiny, shiny
pager with lots of shiny, shiny surgeries.

39
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:49,000
If I were the kind of person who
kissed people, I would kiss you.

40
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,077
I tried to change.

41
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,213
Turn over a new leaf.

42
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,550
- But the leaf isn't turning.
- You weren't ready to change.

43
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:09,888
And that's OK. Adele
wanted me to change, to retire.

44
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,925
Well, I'm still the chief, and this
weekend, I'm moving back home.

45
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,361
- Does Adele know that?
- She'll be fine. She was wrong.

46
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:21,466
- I was right. And now we're...
- Doing it like bunnies. I can't change.

47
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,936
I can't change. I can't change.

48
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:28,273
Be who you are. I am who I am.

49
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,809
- A man.
- A man.

50
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:34,946
I have a way about me.
I'm a man who is who he is.

51
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,515
I have a right to be that man.

52
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:40,919
I'm not gonna say
anything. No judgment.

53
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,854
The man you are
slept with my wife.

54
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,924
And you, you've been
on my land for six months.

55
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:47,692
But I got no judgment.

56
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:51,629
- I'm gonna miss
living on the land.
- It is beautiful.

57
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:55,299
- Wanna buy it?
- You can't sell this land.

58
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,469
You have blueprints. This
is your living room window.

59
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,872
- The house that Derek built.
- Well, that's over.

60
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,575
- I'm getting a place in town.
- But you love this land.

61
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,588
This land and ferry
boats are who you are.

62
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,379
A man can change.

63
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,682
I'm selling the land.

64
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:14,719
Ferry boats... crash.

65
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:31,536
- Morning.
- Hey. All right.

66
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,408
Come on.

67
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,655
Can you take my cases this
morning? Check in on my post-ops?

68
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,847
- Not coming to work?
- I'm gonna hang with Rebecca.

69
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,752
So if you could cover
for me... Hey, take a bite.

70
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,720
Yeah, I'll cover for you.

71
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:53,792
- Alex, she's
not looking very good.
- She's fine.

72
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,662
Come on. Take a bite.

73
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:06,838
Dr. Bailey, I got an answer for you
from the chief about your schedule.

74
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,340
You're not spending
enough hours in the OR,

75
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:12,009
between clinic and
chief resident work.

76
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:15,881
I checked with the attendings and
nailed the chief down to a hard count.

77
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:19,684
You need to spend at least 15 to
20 more hours per week in surgery

78
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:23,387
in order to sit for your boards.
Should I tell the chief that's possible?

79
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:27,626
Just trying to use my power as
the chief's intern for good, so...

80
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:30,895
- Dr. Bailey?
- Hush. I'm trying
to see something.

81
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:35,399
When I'm trying to see something,
I can't do it if you ask me questions.

82
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,436
- What are you trying to see?
- Dr. Bailey, listen.

83
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:41,740
I am really worried about Ava.
I mean Rebecca. I mean Alex.

84
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,175
Well, Alex and Rebecca.

85
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,744
Who used to be called Ava...

86
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:49,046
Anyway, listen, she's crazy,
and I don't mean funny crazy. OK?

87
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:50,915
Bad crazy, OK?

88
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,451
Alex is home with her,
and he's all, "Take a bite."

89
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:56,254
It's weird and sad and...

90
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,067
I want to help, I
don't know what to do.

91
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:01,259
I need you to tell
me what to do.

92
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,995
- What do I do?
- She's trying to see something.

93
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,297
She doesn't need
you asking questions.

94
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,499
What are you trying to see?

95
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,602
The bigger picture.

96
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:15,507
<i>♪ Hit the beat and take
it to the verse now ♪</i>

97
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:19,444
<i>♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪</i>

98
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,746
It's just you and me and Erica.

99
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,816
And we're grabbing you,
ripping off your clothes.

100
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,595
And then you're
naked. You're so hot.

101
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,286
And naked.

102
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:31,722
- And then Erica
starts kissing you.
- Hold on a minute.

103
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:35,026
Erica's kissing you like
you need to be kissed.

104
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,962
And then I pin your hands.

105
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:39,765
- Hold on.
- Above your head.

106
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:43,534
And then I watch as
she uses one finger...

107
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:44,869
Hold on a minute!

108
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,240
Oh. Oh.

109
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,810
OK, I'm sorry, 'cause
that was good for me.

110
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,713
That was really, really
good for me. Good boy.

111
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:57,648
But I have a big trauma
coming in downstairs,

112
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,851
so we have to do
this the fast way.

113
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,759
Every page goes in every set of
documents. Miss one, you're on scut.

114
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,228
These are the most
promising trial patients.

115
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,440
I don't want any mistakes.

116
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,131
- Hard-ass.
- Where were you?

117
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,600
- I had to stay with Cristina.
- That's so nice.

118
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:19,204
- Rebecca's at the house. I needed you.
- She's crazy.

119
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,973
We've had this discussion,
and decided it's not appropriate

120
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:25,476
- to call Izzie crazy. She's spirited.
- Spirited.

121
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,680
Yeah. Not me! I'm not
crazy. Rebecca's crazy.

122
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,560
Alex is pretending
she's not. It's...

123
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:33,117
- Hello.
- I was just helping
Meredith collate.

124
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:38,089
- I'm on my way
to check your patients.
- That's fine. Take your time.

125
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,593
- You seem cheerful.
- I'm gettin' my groove back.

126
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:45,830
I'm gettin' jiggy with it. I'm
gettin' down with the get down.

127
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,944
- Meredith gave me
the sparkle pager.
- What?

128
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,601
She needed it for her mojo.

129
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:52,136
- Ever think I needed it?
- You'd waste it.

130
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,905
I need it to get out
from under Hahn.

131
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:55,407
I won't have to
beg her for OR time

132
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:58,443
if I have the pager. She's not
gonna teach, I'll teach myself.

133
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:01,924
She's just gonna use it for
evil. I... I would use it to do good.

134
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:05,784
And besides, the pager
is sacred. Sacred sparkle.

135
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:08,352
You can't just give it
away. She can't do that.

136
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:11,689
- I think it's nontransferable.
- You don't make rules.

137
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:15,260
- But I am the chief's intern.
- You're the chief's bitch.

138
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:18,696
And you have no power.
Because the power... is in the pager.

139
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:21,499
That's the chief with something
important and powerful.

140
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:27,104
No need for pagers covered with glue
and glitter when you work for the chief.

141
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,774
- Rebecca.
- Me and my world-class
neurosurgeon

142
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:32,611
are gonna use a cutting-edge
technique to save a life.

143
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:35,981
So I don't have time
for crazy. Work it out.

144
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:39,951
Ooh, a trauma.

145
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,714
- What do we got?
- Not, "What do we got?"

146
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:46,490
- What do I got, I don't know.
- Sparkle pager rules.

147
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,994
- Whatever it is, it's mine now.
- What do we have?

148
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:50,895
- I don't know. Sparkle pager.
- No.

149
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,898
You can't sparkle pager
it. It's not her pager.

150
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,133
Yang, it's yours.
Stevens, cover the pit.

151
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,196
You volunteer to
oversee Karev's post-ops?

152
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:01,172
- Yes...
- Don't have time
for pettiness. Go.

153
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:05,410
- Hey, Callie.
- Hi. Hello, Erica.

154
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:08,012
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Nothing.

155
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,347
- You look all hot and bothered.
- No. It's just,

156
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,686
there's a trauma, and it's
really big. That's all. It's big.

157
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,655
- It's a big trauma.
- You're acting weird.

158
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,458
- She uses one finger...
- Really big trauma.

159
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,862
Torres, it's like you never
seen a really big trauma before.

160
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,002
Oh, my.

161
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,239
Really big trauma.

162
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,081
So how you want to handle this?

163
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,049
I...

164
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,653
Uh...

165
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,555
Help me.

166
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,527
Really big trauma.

167
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,432
Please.

168
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,835
Help me.

169
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:13,277
- Look, we were
just joking around.
- Yeah, it was a dare.

170
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:17,681
You dared... him to lay in a vat
of cement at a construction site.

171
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,351
Hey, we never thought
he'd do it. It's Andy.

172
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,753
He never does anything.

173
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:24,756
- He doesn't have the guts.
- In the middle of the night,

174
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,025
you snuck into a
construction site

175
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,094
- and dared your friend...
- He's not our friend.

176
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:33,831
The four of us, we're friends.
But he's not really our friend.

177
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,669
OK, you dared him
to lie down in concrete.

178
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:42,173
Nobody made him do it. You're making
it sound like we did something wrong.

179
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:46,877
- How long?
- What?

180
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,113
How long did your not friend

181
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:51,182
lay in that vat of
cement unable to move

182
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:54,018
before you four geniuses,
you band of brothers,

183
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,355
future Mother Teresas, how
long did he lay in that cement

184
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:00,892
yelling that he couldn't move
before you called the police?

185
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:06,130
Yeah. That's what I thought.

186
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:12,170
The cytoplasmic viral
particles in the malignant cells

187
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,005
but not in the normal tissue.

188
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,674
No idea what you're
saying, but it sounds brilliant.

189
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,243
Boring but brilliant.

190
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,244
You wanted to spend
more time together.

191
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,146
I meant the movies
or ball games.

192
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,549
But a clinical trial
is just as good.

193
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:25,928
- Hi.
- Hey.

194
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:27,718
Combining the
Fr1904 and trichostatin

195
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,954
increases the expression
of the virus in the tumor.

196
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,001
Introduce them during the
M phase of the cell cycle?

197
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,858
- Exactly.
- Champagne with our name
written on it.

198
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,794
She understands
how brilliant you are.

199
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,763
OK, so Jeremy West
is patient number 12,

200
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:43,768
and patient 13 is Beth Monroe. Jeremy
is suffering from grand mal seizures,

201
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,838
Beth is paralyzed on the right
side. Who do you want to meet first?

202
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,273
Jeremy's surgery's today,
Beth's isn't until tomorrow.

203
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,643
- They're young.
- Yeah, which makes
them resilient.

204
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,880
- OK.
- OK. Bye.

205
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:58,149
Clinical trial, fun.

206
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:02,353
- So, what do you
want to do first?
- I don't know.

207
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,456
OK. Well, what do
you want us to do first?

208
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,159
- I don't know.
- All right, look,
we blasted him

209
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:11,162
out of the job site, but we
figured, don't blast too close.

210
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:15,066
This is a lot of concrete. Planning
on treating him, we need to start.

211
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:18,670
- So, what do you want to do?
- I don't know!

212
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:26,577
I'm sorry. Uh...

213
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:30,214
OK, I know I'm not doing my best

214
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:33,284
to instill a sense of
confidence in my abilities.

215
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:36,320
It's just that you are trapped

216
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,990
in what I'm guessing is
several tons of cement,

217
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,026
and I've never seen a
boy... How old are you?

218
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,730
- Nineteen.
- Then you're a man.

219
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:49,968
I've never seen a man trapped
in several tons of cement before.

220
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,670
But now that I have,
I'm gonna figure this out.

221
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,706
I'm gonna work with other
surgeons, we'll figure out a plan

222
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,608
and we're going to save you.

223
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,944
OK, I never, ever promise life,

224
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:04,115
but I'm promising this to
you. Do you understand?

225
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,450
- I do.
- OK.

226
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,353
I don't know much yet,
but the one thing I do know

227
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:14,291
is that the cement you're encased
in is slowly leeching the water

228
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:19,297
from your body, and you're gonna need
all the water you can get, so no crying.

229
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,099
You're a strong young
man. I know you can do this.

230
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,271
Good. Good.

231
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,409
OK, you're gonna live.

232
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,011
I'll make sure that you live.

233
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,283
Here you go.

234
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:45,668
- Hello.
- Hello.

235
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,459
- Dr. Grey, is this him?
- Him?

236
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:52,897
- She has a pet name for you.
- The Seattle Grace
Brain Butcher.

237
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,167
- Beth. I'm sorry.
- Oh, no,
that's fine. That's me.

238
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,436
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

239
00:13:58,538 --> 00:13:59,737
Pleasure.

240
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,973
Um, that hand's just
for show. So come on.

241
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,475
Tell me, how does this work?

242
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:07,244
You're going to inject a
live virus into her tumor?

243
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,346
Mm-hmm.

244
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:09,458
And that's safe?

245
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:11,382
The virus is still
in testing stages.

246
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,851
I've made adjustments
that destroy the tumor.

247
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:18,389
- Hey, tumor destroyers. I like that.
- Has this ever worked before?

248
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,625
- No.
- So I'm your lab rat.

249
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,561
- Beth.
- I'm just saying if this works,

250
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:27,365
my name will go down in the annals
of some book. That's kinda cool.

251
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:31,436
- Not if I beat you to it.
- Beth. This is
our other patient.

252
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,004
- Jeremy.
- You didn't call.

253
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,373
- Know each other?
- I thought you backed out.

254
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,177
As if I'd break our
pact? Come here.

255
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,813
They know each other.

256
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,856
- What is he doing here?
- His surgery is this afternoon.

257
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,525
I knew she didn't find this
clinical trial on her own.

258
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:57,995
Bizarre experimental
surgery, it had to be Jeremy.

259
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:01,299
They met when they were both
being treated at Mayo last year.

260
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,702
They went through chemo,
radiation, a support group.

261
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:08,472
- You don't want them
to be together?
- Look, we like Jeremy.

262
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,140
He's a good kid. I feel for him

263
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,987
that he's going
through this alone,

264
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:15,245
but we worry about Beth. She
thinks that she's in love with him.

265
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:19,550
We just don't want her getting so
attached to someone that might...

266
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:23,287
- Die.
- If something happens,

267
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:28,158
if he doesn't survive,
Beth won't want to live.

268
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:32,397
She's my only
child. She has to...

269
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:35,566
She has to want
to fight to stay alive.

270
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,050
- You paged?
- Oh, O'Malley.

271
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:45,175
There's a binder on occupational
medicine articles in my office.

272
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,846
Should be a toxicology section. See
if you can find anything on cement.

273
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,915
- Yes, sir.
- Let Shepherd or Grey know

274
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,950
- I need to see them.
- Will do.

275
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:56,688
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

276
00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:59,256
My God.

277
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,728
Why...? Wh...?

278
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,697
What is everybody doing
standing around here?

279
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,966
This is what your
guys told us to do.

280
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:12,369
And exactly where are my guys?

281
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:16,641
Work from the outside in! No more
time. This is what we have to do.

282
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,942
- I am right.
- Why is the patient in there

283
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:21,211
and all of you are in here?

284
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:25,083
Torres is worried about limbs.
Bailey about abdominal crush.

285
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,819
Dr. Sloan feels the burns
should take the first look,

286
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:30,921
Hahn feels the heart and
lung issues are gonna kill him

287
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,491
- before we get to any of this.
- In other words...

288
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:36,927
- No one can agree
on where to start.
- I know where to start.

289
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,891
Cement's contracting. I don't get
in, he could lose legs and right arm.

290
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:09,393
I'd like to see
him without a liver.

291
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:12,296
We'd prefer him to
suffer a painful death

292
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,998
as the alkaline continues
to burn through his skin?

293
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:18,102
You can't chip away. Once
his circulation opens up,

294
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:22,306
the built-up toxins will stop his
heart, not to mention rhabdomyolosis.

295
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,342
- Treat with dialysis.
- Let us work.

296
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:27,389
- I found an article,
doesn't say a lot.
- Put in a Swan-Ganz.

297
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,414
- Usually at the bottom of a river.
- - You are so wrong.

298
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,276
- I'm so wrong?
- You are. Wrong.

299
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:35,219
- You two working
together on this?
- Everybody stand down!

300
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:39,323
We are fighting the clock. It took
one hour for the kids to call 911.

301
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:43,193
Three hours for search and rescue
to get this guy cut out of the cement.

302
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:46,063
Less than four to six hours
to get him out of cement

303
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:50,635
and into the OR before he is dead.
We are fighting one hell of a clock.

304
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:56,107
Every minute counts. We
work as a team, or that man dies.

305
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,442
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir. Of course.

306
00:17:58,544 --> 00:17:59,977
Where do you want me, chief?

307
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,857
Find Grey and be
her intern for the day.

308
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,415
I have too many
bodies in the room.

309
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,195
Patient's name?

310
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,396
Andrew Langston.

311
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,320
OK, let's go save his life.

312
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,025
Hey.

313
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:22,934
You intimidate me a little. I mean,
you're not an intimidating person,

314
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:26,970
but the legend of
Meredith and Derek.

315
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:30,040
It's... intimidating.

316
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,944
- No legend.
- He's selling his land
because of you.

317
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:35,947
- There's a legend.
- Derek's selling his land?

318
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:37,881
He doesn't say
it's because of you.

319
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:41,886
He was making plans to build a house
when you were together, and now...

320
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:44,655
I'm... I'm not trying to...

321
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,325
I just really like him.

322
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,794
And you intimidate me.

323
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,832
There's no legend.

324
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,734
OK.

325
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:58,970
OK.

326
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,905
OK.

327
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:14,852
Izzie had a question
about some post-ops.

328
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,790
- What'd I miss?
- What?

329
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,126
The movie. What'd I miss?

330
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,934
- Hey. Hey.
- I'm sorry.

331
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,469
Don't be sorry.

332
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,304
I think...

333
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,376
I wet my pants.

334
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:41,712
Oh.

335
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,549
Oh, that's, uh... that's OK.

336
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,618
That's... that's OK.

337
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,024
I'll do better. I promise.

338
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:55,993
Don't worry about
it. You're doing fine.

339
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,567
Come on.

340
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:11,742
I forgot to tell you.
Guess who called me.

341
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:15,245
Carrie from our support
group. She didn't sound so good.

342
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,447
Have you talked to her lately?

343
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:21,118
- No, she...
- Oh, God.

344
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,755
Her husband said they
tried radiation one last time.

345
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,323
He said it was bad.

346
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:30,460
The last day, she didn't even
recognize him. And the pain.

347
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,998
She was screaming
and begging them to...

348
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,700
He said it was bad.

349
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,703
Yeah.

350
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:40,538
Hey.

351
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:45,976
At least we don't have to
worry about that. You know?

352
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,079
This surgery will work. OK?

353
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:54,051
And if it doesn't, at
least we'll die quick.

354
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:04,261
Yeah, we'll die super-fast
and without pain.

355
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:05,663
Yes.

356
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:10,534
Dr. Grey, I thought we talked
about changing Beth's room.

357
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,636
It isn't sunny enough in here.

358
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:16,107
The room is fine, and it's
right down the hall from Jeremy.

359
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:19,076
I'd like to move her
as soon as possible.

360
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:22,113
Mrs. Monroe, I checked.
There aren't any beds available.

361
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,581
Not in a private room.

362
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:31,255
Mom, why don't you go find Dad?

363
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:33,557
I can wait for him here.

364
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,997
Mom, why don't you go find Dad so I
can kiss Jeremy without you watching?

365
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:43,267
- It's time Jeremy went back...
- I don't understand wh...

366
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,070
Nurse!

367
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,941
I need a nurse. He's seizing!

368
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,013
All right.

369
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:59,050
Let's run a second set
of labs before surgery.

370
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:03,887
How's Beth? Was she...
was she scared? Or...

371
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,422
She's fine.

372
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:08,826
Chief wants you or Shepherd.
He says it's important.

373
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:10,594
- I'll go.
- He put me on you.

374
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:13,397
- What can I do? How can I help?
- You can run labs for me.

375
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:17,067
- Labs, that's it?
- Yeah. Thanks.

376
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:21,104
Hi.

377
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,082
- What's that?
- - Pouring vinegar on your flesh

378
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,486
to minimize burns inside your
skin caused by the cement.

379
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,389
I'm burning from the inside out?

380
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,793
I'm dying. I'm dying, aren't I?

381
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:45,095
Andrew, that word's
not allowed anymore.

382
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:47,531
I'm banning that word
from your vocabulary.

383
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:49,300
Can you move your fingers?

384
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:51,568
That's very good.

385
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,972
I'm not usually this dumb.

386
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:57,875
Most people think
I'm pretty smart.

387
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:00,177
I make the dean's list. I tutor.

388
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:03,447
I'm not... I'm not usually
the guy who's dumb enough

389
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,482
to jump into a tub
of cement for a girl.

390
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:08,552
Wait, not the girl
you came in with?

391
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:12,756
- You did this for her?
- Lola.

392
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:16,059
The guys dared me.
She was watching.

393
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,229
And I...

394
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,063
She was watching.

395
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,771
And now not only is
she totally unimpressed,

396
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,639
but after I'm gone,

397
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,142
she'll remember me as the
idiot who was dumb enough

398
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,311
to jump into a tub of cement.

399
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,792
People will write
stories about my idiocy

400
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,694
and forward them
to their friends.

401
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,730
I'm gonna die as a
bad e-mail forward.

402
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,454
Hey. We all mess up.

403
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:48,124
I'm the guy who died in a block
of cement trying to impress a girl.

404
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:51,194
I'm like Han Solo.

405
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,698
In<i> Star Wars?</i>

406
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:57,200
He was encased in carbonite?

407
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,141
You wanted to see me?

408
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:06,777
I got a call from the IRB.

409
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:10,314
The national board that
oversees and reviews clinical trials.

410
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,348
Your clinical trial.

411
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,218
You've had 11 deaths. They're
giving you one last patient.

412
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,054
You get it today under the
wire and hope for the best.

413
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:22,092
At midnight, if you lose him,
they're gonna shut you down, period.

414
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,094
One last patient.

415
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:28,810
- You're angry at him. The chief.
- But why?

416
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:32,402
- Why am I angry at him?
- Because you have
opened up your past.

417
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:35,673
It's like you're reliving it all
now. You're angry with him.

418
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:39,276
You're angry with your mother.
You're angry with yourself.

419
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:42,613
Chief went back to his wife.
My mother didn't want to live.

420
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:45,027
He did what he had to do.
She did what she had to do.

421
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:47,718
- Your mother
didn't wanna kill herself.
- No, she did.

422
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,655
- How can you be sure?
- How can you be? You weren't there.

423
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:54,424
The answer is
right in front of you.

424
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:57,094
Think about it.

425
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:00,431
- The IRB is saying I failed?
- You haven't.

426
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:03,100
I failed. I'll sign the
discharge order for Beth.

427
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:06,303
You can't. This is her last
shot. You have until midnight.

428
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:08,872
- Jeremy's today.
- Move Jeremy's surgery up.

429
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:11,742
Beth's this afternoon. Fit
them in before midnight.

430
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:15,111
- If I get the dosage right.
- You're so close. You haven't failed.

431
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:18,916
But are we going too far
here? These are people's lives.

432
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:23,453
- Is my ego too big here?
- Your ego is just
the right size.

433
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,221
We can do this.

434
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,524
Two patients.

435
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:32,329
Bends the rules
without breaking 'em.

436
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:35,899
- You'll clear it
with the chief?
- Yeah.

437
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:39,770
- Jeremy's going
into surgery soon?
- In a couple of hours.

438
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,873
- How is he?
- Oh, he's stable.

439
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:45,086
Yeah, he's actually
better than stable.

440
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,911
He called me the angel of death.

441
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,080
He's good then.

442
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:54,851
- Can I see him?
- Honey, no.

443
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:58,488
I'll just be gone a few minutes.
Can you get me a wheelchair?

444
00:25:58,591 --> 00:26:01,925
If you're having surgery today,
you need to rest. You don't...

445
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:05,295
We just want to spend
some time with you. That's all.

446
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,030
Please.

447
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:13,503
- We're the last two.
- What?

448
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,206
From our support group.

449
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:19,309
Jeremy and I are
the last two still alive.

450
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:30,820
Hey. Have you seen Cristina?

451
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:34,302
I've done everything I'm supposed
to. She sees me doing nothing,

452
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:37,194
- not in the mood
to get yelled at.
- With cement boy.

453
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:39,776
- Cement boy?
- Don't bother. Don't need interns.

454
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:41,164
They don't want interns there.

455
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,734
Interns are in the way!
I'm not complaining.

456
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:48,071
Two minutes of complaining between
me and you. No one has to know.

457
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:51,007
I have all this
power! Supposedly.

458
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,377
I supposedly am imbued with
power of being the chief's intern.

459
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,947
But there's a cement
boy, and I'm stuck in here,

460
00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:00,150
running labs, researching
effects of cement on the body

461
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:02,920
in the vain hopes somebody
asks me a question.

462
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:06,923
I'm not in with the cement boy because,
even though I have all this power,

463
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:09,092
I can't use it because
it's not real power.

464
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:11,594
- It's fake power?
- Fake power.

465
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:14,597
I can go into the chief's
office whenever I want.

466
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,532
You know what he
has in there? Files.

467
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,370
Confidential on every
resident in this hospital.

468
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:21,783
And I'm just allowed
in, and he's not worried

469
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,573
because he knows and I know

470
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:25,776
that I don't have
any real power.

471
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:27,811
I don't have the
power to look at them!

472
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:29,625
Make you feel
better if you could?

473
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:31,581
You know what would
make me feel better?

474
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:36,653
If I feel like there was a reason
for this, that there was a point.

475
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:40,891
Oh, God. My poor, poor parents.

476
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,259
How would they face
anyone at the funeral?

477
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:46,462
OK, Andrew, you're gonna
make a lot of mistakes in your life,

478
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:48,766
but mistakes are...
They're pieces.

479
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:51,135
Like this is a foolish piece,

480
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:52,836
but, you know,
it's just a piece.

481
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:54,637
Be proud of the whole picture.

482
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:58,475
The whole picture defines
you, not just this one piece.

483
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:03,046
I'm a loser. I'm a loser.
I'm a loser. I'm a loser.

484
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,415
- Come on. Andrew.
- I'm a loser.

485
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:10,053
Andrew. Hey, listen to
me. Han Solo is not a loser.

486
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:13,924
Han Solo got encased in carbonite,
and... and that was a big mess.

487
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:17,360
Not what he's remembered
for. He's remembered as the guy

488
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,863
who made the Kessel
run in less than 12 parsecs,

489
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:22,565
and who braved temperatures
of the ice planet Hoth

490
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:26,236
in order to save someone he cared
about from the big, ugly wampa.

491
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:29,005
He is remembered as the
guy who swooped down,

492
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:32,575
blasted Darth Vader out of the
sky so that Luke could use the Force

493
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:38,281
and destroy the damn Death Star, OK?
Princess Leia saved him from the carbonite.

494
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,685
And they fell in love and
they saved the universe

495
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:45,822
and had twin Jedi babies that
went on to save the universe again.

496
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:47,724
Now, that's the whole picture.

497
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:51,061
The carbonite, it
was just a piece, OK?

498
00:28:57,803 --> 00:28:59,869
So I like science-fiction.
Got a problem?

499
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:02,172
- No.
- It's great.

500
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,975
Do what you doing.

501
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,217
I got Jeremy's labs back.
Good to go for surgery.

502
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,786
- Chief sign off on that?
- Yeah.

503
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:22,091
Where are you going?
Get a wheelchair.

504
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:23,861
What are you doing?

505
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:26,396
M-My mom went to
go call my grandma,

506
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,176
and my dad went
to the cafeteria.

507
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,045
There wasn't a
wheelchair in my room.

508
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:32,569
I just want to see
Jeremy. Please.

509
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:36,373
I don't want the seizure to be
the last time I see him. Please.

510
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:39,175
- I just need to see him.
- OK, let's go.

511
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:42,946
Am I going to get to
be alone with Jeremy?

512
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:46,983
I mean, "alone" alone?

513
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:50,620
- Alone?
- We've never done it,
either of us.

514
00:29:50,723 --> 00:29:53,990
We've been waiting until we
both were tumor free, but surgery...

515
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:57,126
Anything could happen.
We can do it, right?

516
00:29:57,229 --> 00:30:00,497
It won't kill us or anything?

517
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,465
No, no.

518
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:07,403
- No, it won't kill you.
- I mean, you've done it, right?

519
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:10,173
- With each other?
- I've... He's done...

520
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,420
He's done it, and
I've done it, yeah.

521
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:13,910
What's it like? Is it magical?

522
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,779
- Yes.
- It can be.

523
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:18,215
With the right person.

524
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:26,523
I'm gonna go get you some
clothes. You got shampoo in there?

525
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:35,866
I don't understand.

526
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:38,902
I don't understand.
I was pregnant.

527
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,737
I was pregnant.

528
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,040
I know I was.

529
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,777
- It's OK.
- I don't...

530
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:49,880
It's OK. You just got
confused. That's all.

531
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:52,949
You just got confused, OK?

532
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,486
OK.

00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:49,806
- It's really sweet.
- We're pimps.

544
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,708
Yentas.

545
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:54,077
- They're so in love.
- Oh, yeah.

546
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:57,047
It's all new and
fresh and exciting.

547
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:59,249
I've never been a fan of new.

548
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:02,819
I like to know the person, their
bodies, what makes them moan.

549
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:07,323
Something happen?
Beth isn't in her room.

550
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,527
Oh, well, that's because I
had my intern take her down

551
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:13,797
- for a pre-op MRI.
- Thank God.

552
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:16,499
I was afraid she was
lying somewhere in pain.

553
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,835
No, she's not in any pain.

554
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,338
We should go to the conference
room. There's paperwork

555
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,773
- you haven't filled out.
- Thank you.

556
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:25,742
You bet.

557
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:30,279
I'll be here, doing my thing.

558
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:33,783
It's at 20 centimeters.
Inflate the balloon.

559
00:32:33,886 --> 00:32:36,553
- I am.
- So then inflate it more.

560
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:39,021
- Yes, Dr. Hahn.
- They loosen another piece,

561
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,491
this leg swells even
more. His pressure is 18.

562
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:44,027
Does he have a pulse with that?

563
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,033
I always did enjoy a
good game of Twister.

564
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,074
- It's finished. I'm in.
- Yang, do not sew
that in. Hold it.

565
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,410
I will check your
work when I'm done.

566
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:04,581
- Chief, I've gotta
do a fasciotomy.
- What? A what?

567
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:08,084
Relieve the pressure in your
leg or you could lose the limb.

568
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:11,187
Don't worry. You
probably won't feel a thing.

569
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:14,457
Oh, God.

570
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:31,875
Hey, Dr. Stevens.
What's going down?

571
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:33,843
What's going down?

572
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:36,679
Cristina sparkle paging
me out of cement boy.

573
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:39,983
Alex not answering the phone.
Alex and his insane girlfriend.

574
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:44,220
Alex! Alex! I'm checking
in. Call me back.

575
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:48,091
- God! The things we do
for the people we love.
- Exactly. It's...

576
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,998
How'd it go?

577
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,200
- Derek.
- What?

578
00:33:57,302 --> 00:33:58,868
How'd it go?

579
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:02,305
It was, um...

580
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:05,541
It was amazing. Thank you.

581
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:09,812
We have to take Jeremy
down to the OR now.

582
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,050
OK.

583
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,154
- OK.
- OK.

584
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:24,994
- So I... I'll see you after?
- Definitely.

585
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,264
I don't think, um...

586
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:32,435
I'm not sure you'll be conscious,
uh, before we take Beth, so...

587
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:37,673
So... so I'll see you
after your surgery.

588
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,742
All right. See you after.

589
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,350
- Wait, Jer. Wait.
- Yeah.

590
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:53,923
- What if you die?
- I won't.

591
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:57,860
- What if I die?
- You won't.

592
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,198
OK, but...

593
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,302
You changed my
life, Jeremy West.

594
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:11,040
You made it better, you
made it brighter, full of joy.

595
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:14,710
- And if I die...
- Don't you dare die.

596
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:16,891
OK?

597
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:20,150
We're not finished yet.

598
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:22,985
I'm not finished loving you.

599
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:38,267
OK, go ahead. Go ahead.
Get your head chopped open.

600
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,069
I'm right behind you.

601
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,959
Do not kill him.

602
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:13,703
- You nervous?
- I have my ego to keep me warm.

603
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:16,439
- Can't you feel it?
- What?

604
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:19,442
The majesty of lifesaving.

605
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:23,113
When did you become an optimist?

606
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,184
Selling your land.

607
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:31,021
Trying to move forward.

608
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,790
So am I.

609
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:41,998
- Who's there?
- George O'Malley.

610
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,301
- I was paged to the supply closet.
- - Are you alone?

611
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,169
Lexie?

612
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:50,807
Remember how I
said I wasn't a thief?

613
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:54,777
- I think maybe I am.
- Alexandra Caroline Grey!

614
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,481
I couldn't help it. I had to know.
And then once I knew, I knew.

615
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,950
Get these back to the
chief's office right now.

616
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,554
I tried to stop reading, but I
couldn't. I have photographic memory,

617
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:06,990
which is how I got
through Harvard Med.

618
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:10,426
I read all files. Information is
burned into my brain. I read yours.

619
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,329
- No, I don't wanna know.
- You failed the intern exam

620
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:16,332
by one point. One point.

621
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:35,318
The OR is booked
and standing by.

622
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:39,789
Dr. Bailey, what is it?

623
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,492
Something...

624
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:47,263
Something... we're missing.

625
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,766
We're forgetting something.

626
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:53,270
Gangrene, compartment
syndrome, compression,

627
00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:57,574
fluid balance,
electrolytes. What is it?

628
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:01,678
What is it? Gangrene,
compartment syndrome, compression,

629
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:06,115
fluids, electrolytes. Gangrene,
compartment syndrome,

630
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,751
compression,
fluids, electrolytes.

631
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:13,723
Gangrene, compartment
syndrome, compression, fluids, elec...

632
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,362
Bladder. His bladder.

633
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,098
We've been hydrating
him for over four hours now.

634
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,177
If we don't get a
catheter in him quick...

635
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:26,636
His bladder's gonna explode.

636
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:34,711
Can I have mayo?

637
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,580
See? You have an
appetite. That's a good sign.

638
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,587
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey, Iz. I'll be right back.

639
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:48,024
- What's going on?
<i>- How's Rebecca?</i>

640
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:49,859
She's fine. What do you need?

641
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:51,739
- Did she eat? Call her husband?
<i>- Iz.</i>

642
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:53,641
<i>Don't get mad because I care.</i>

643
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:54,964
Not caring. Butting in.

644
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:57,311
- I'm butting in because I care.
<i>- Know how you care?</i>

645
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,936
<i>By covering me at work, not
calling me every hour and asking...</i>

646
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:03,973
<i>- Hang on. Rebecca?</i>
- Alex?

647
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,109
<i>Rebecca?</i>

648
00:39:07,112 --> 00:39:08,144
Alex?

649
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:16,920
Time of death, 11:47.

650
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:21,791
<i>♪ What if we stop
having a ball? ♪</i>

651
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:26,974
Rebecca!

652
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:31,033
<i>♪ What if the paint
chips from the wall? ♪</i>

653
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:38,541
<i>♪ What if there's always
cups in the sink? ♪</i>

654
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:43,546
You don't have to say
any... thing. Don't say it.

655
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:51,020
<i>Alex? Are you still there? Alex?</i>

656
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:54,858
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't...

657
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:59,028
Don't say anything.

658
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:03,566
OK? Don't say anything.

659
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:08,571
Don't say anything!
Don't say anything!

660
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:12,809
